CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  Regulation (EU) 2019/ 1242 1 sets CO 2 emission performance standards for new heavy-duty vehicles. It is a key contribution to achieve the objectives set in the EU climate law, including the 2050 climate neutrality and the 2030 target to reduce economy-wide CO 2 emissions by 55% compared to 1990.  The automotive industry is of key importance for the EU economy and accounts for over 7% of the EU's GDP. It provides jobs - directly or indirectly, in manufacturing, sales, maintenance, construction and transport services - to around 13 million Europeans. The automotive sector is undergoing a structural transformation including changes in clean and digital technologies. The CO 2 standards provide long-term certainty and predictability for investors along the value chain, therefore enabling such sectoral transformation, while allowing sufficient lead time for a fair transition towards zero-emission vehicles.  The regulation requires that the annual EU fleet-wide average CO 2 emissions from new heavy-duty vehicles are reduced in five-year intervals. In 2025, a target of 15% reduction of CO 2 compared to 2019 values starts applying in each reporting period for the 2025–2029 period for heavy lorries with a technically permissible maximum laden mass (TPMLM) greater than 16 t. This is followed by a CO 2 reduction target for a wider group of heavy-duty vehicles, including lorries with TPMLM > 5t and buses with TPMLM > 7,5 t of 43% applicable as from 2030 onwards. The latter target effectively requires a significant share of zero-emission (e.g. battery electric) vehicles amongst the registered new vehicles of a manufacturer.  Each year, the average CO 2 emissions and the specific CO 2 emissions target for each manufacturer are established, based on the EU fleet-wide target, in order to evaluate the manufacturers’ performance in complying with their targets.  Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 allows manufacturers to collect emission credits if their specific CO 2 emissions are below the CO 2 emissions reduction trajectory, which is a linear trajectory between the targets applicable at the beginning of two subsequent 5-years periods. These emission credits can then be used for compliance at a later stage.  This targeted amendment provides manufacturers with an additional flexibility on CO 2 targets, allowing them to collect more emission credits in the years before 2030. It would facilitate compliance in the period as of 2030, while maintaining the targets for reducing CO 2 emissions. Further possible modifications of this Regulation are entirely outside of the scope and aims of the present proposal. The need for such modifications may be assessed, as appropriate, in the context of the upcoming review of the Regulation. To maintain regulatory certainty and predictability, it is essential that this additional flexibility is agreed between the European Parliament and Council swiftly and without delay. The Commission will constructively engage with the co-legislators, in order to ensure that the legislative process on the present proposal fully preserves its essential object and does not distort it.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  This proposal does not amend the substantive rules of Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 and it maintains the targets. The proposal responds to concerns expressed in the EU by the automotive sector, by providing an additional flexibility for manufacturers to comply with the objectives of the Regulation.  • Consistency with other Union policies  The European Climate Law Regulation 2 establishes the framework for achieving climate neutrality within the EU by 2050. The regulation requires the reduction of net EU greenhouse-gas emissions by at least 55% (compared to 1990 levels) by 2030. In line with the EU Climate Law reduction targets, Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 sets emission reduction targets for heavy-duty vehicles.  The Commission also proposed an amendment to the European Climate Law that enshrines the 2040 target of 90% reduction. Both Council and the European Parliament have established their positions on the file, which is currently in co-decision.  The current proposal does not change the CO 2 emission reduction targets and does not lower the overall CO 2 emission standards ambitions. It introduces an additional flexibility for heavy-duty vehicle manufacturers to comply with the 2030 emission reduction targets, while keeping the certainty and predictability for investors along the value chain.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  The legal basis for this proposal is Article 192 of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). In accordance with Article 191 and 192(1) TFEU, the European Union shall contribute to the pursuit, inter alia, of the following objectives: preserving, protecting and improving the quality of the environment; promoting measures at international level to deal with regional or worldwide environmental problems, and in particular combating climate change. Based on Article 192 of the TFEU, the Union has already adopted policies to address CO 2 emissions from heavy-duty in Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 and its first amendment through Regulation (EU) 2024/1610 3 .  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  This initiative is consistent with the principle of subsidiarity. Amendment of Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 to provide this additional flexibility cannot be achieved by the Member States themselves.  • Proportionality  The proposal is consistent with the principle of proportionality, because it does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the Union’s objectives of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in a cost-effective manner, while providing vehicles manufacturers with an additional flexibility for their compliance while maintaining the level of ambition of the targets.  • Choice of the instrument  The proposal amends Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 only as regards providing an additional flexibility on the compliance periods. Thus, it should follow the same form of act, i.e. a regulation.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  No evaluation is necessary for the proposal, since it only provides for a temporary flexibility for vehicles manufacturers to comply with the 2030 CO 2 emission reduction targets.  • Stakeholder consultations  The Commission held intense and extensive discussions with manufacturers and stakeholders from the automotive value chain in bilateral meetings and in the context of high-level meetings on heavy-duty vehicles, which took place in Q3 and Q4 of 2025.  • Collection and use of expertise  The proposal has been elaborated following a process of internal scrutiny of existing obligations and is based on experience in implementing the related legislation, including the annual monitoring process of manufacturers’ CO 2 compliance.  • Impact assessment  The proposal concerns targeted changes of Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 to provide manufacturers with an additional temporary flexibility as regards their compliance obligations. It does not change the level of ambition of the targets. Therefore no impact assessment was performed.  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  Compared to the current Regulation, the proposal is not expected to increase administrative costs. In addition, it is not increasing the complexity of the legal framework.  • Fundamental rights  The proposal respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union 4 . In particular, it contributes to the objective of a high level of environmental protection in accordance with the principle of sustainable development as laid down in Article 37 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  The legislative financial statement setting out the implications for budgetary, human and administrative resources was attached to the proposal which led to the adoption of Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 and its latest revision by Regulation (EU) 2024/1610.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  This proposal does not change the substance of the rules, the implementation assessment remains the same as of the proposal which led to the adoption of Regulation (EU) 2019/1242, as amended by Regulation (EU) 2024/1610.  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  Article 1(1) of this Regulation amends:  · Article 7(1)(a) of Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 in order to specify the revised rules for determining the emission credits;  · Annex I of Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 in order to introduce the necessary formulas in Annex I point 5.2, implementing the amendment to Article 7(1)(a).  2025/0423 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 as regards the calculation of emission credits for heavy-duty vehicles for the reporting periods of the years 2025 to 2029  (Text with EEA relevance)  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192(1) thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 5 ,  Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions 6 ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 of the European Parliament and of the Council 7 sets out the CO 2 targets for new heavy-duty vehicles, that form a key part of the Union framework to reduce by 2030 net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 % below 1990 levels and reach economy-wide climate-neutrality by 2050.  (2) Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 sets progressively stricter CO 2 emission reduction targets for manufacturers. Those reduction targets provide long-term certainty and predictability for investors along the value chain, while allowing sufficient lead time for a fair transition. It is therefore essential to keep the level of the CO 2 emissions reduction targets established under Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 unchanged.  (3) In order to facilitate compliance with the targets applicable as of 2030, in consideration of the delay in the deployment of the public charging infrastructure along motorways for heavy-duty vehicles, the manufacturers should be able to generate more emission credits before 2030, which may also incentivise earlier deployment of zero-emission heavy-duty vehicles .  (4) Therefore, it is appropriate that only during the reporting periods of the years 2025 to 2029 manufacturers should collect emission credits if their specific CO 2 emissions are below the specific CO 2 emissions target rather than below the CO 2 emissions reduction trajectory.  (5) Taking into account that deployment of zero-emission urban buses is already advanced and their use is not negatively affected by a possible lack of development of the public charging infrastructure along motorways , t his amendment should not apply to urban buses .  (6) Since the objectives of this Regulation to provide vehicles manufacturers with an additional flexibility for their compliance while maintaining the level of ambition of the CO 2 reduction targets cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States , but can rather, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives .  (7) Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 should therefore be amended accordingly,  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Article 1  Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 is amended as follows:  (1) In Article 7(1) , point (a) is amended as follows:  “(a) the difference between the CO 2 emissions reduction trajectory as referred to in paragraph 2 for the reporting period of the year 2025 and the average specific CO 2 emissions of that manufacturer for the reporting periods of the years from 2025 to 2029; and the difference between the CO 2 emissions reduction trajectory for reporting periods of years other than from 2025 to 2029 and the average specific CO 2 emissions of that manufacturer for the same reporting period; if that difference is positive (‘emission credits’); or”  (2) Annex I is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.  Article 2  This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union .  This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.

FRAMEWORK OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE  1.1. Title of the proposal/initiative  Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 to include an additional flexibility for manufacturers of new heavy-duty vehicles as regards the calculation of emission credits in the reporting periods of the years 2025 to 2029  1.2. Policy area(s) concerned  Climate policy  1.3. Objective(s)  1.3.1. General objective(s)  The CO 2 standards provide long-term certainty and predictability for investors along the automotive value chain, while allowing sufficient lead time for a fair transition. The amending proposal aims at providing additional flexibility for manufacturers to comply with the 2030 CO 2 target, while leaving the level of ambition unchanged.  1.3.2. Specific objective(s)  The proposal concerns targeted changes of the CO 2 heavy-duty vehicle Regulation to provide manufacturers with an additional flexibility: it provides for the possibility to collect more emission credits in the years before 2030, which then can be used for compliance in the years after.  1.3.3. Expected result(s) and impact  Specify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.  The amendment, if adopted, would determine that during the reporting periods of the years 2025 to 2029 manufacturers shall collect emission credits if their specific CO 2 emissions are below the CO 2 targets rather than below the emissions reduction trajectory.  1.3.4. Indicators of performance  Specify the indicators for monitoring progress and achievements.  Monitor the CO 2 compliance of manufacturers in the period 2025 - 2030.  1.4. The proposal/initiative relates to:   a new action   a new action following a pilot project / preparatory action 8   the extension of an existing action   a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action  1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative  1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative  The amending proposal aims at providing additional flexibility for manufacturers to comply with the CO 2 targets, while maintaining overall ambition on the CO 2 reduction targets over the period 2025-2040.  1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, greater effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this section 'added value of EU involvement' is the value resulting from EU action, that is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.  Climate change is a trans-boundary problem, which cannot be solved by national or local action alone. Coordination of climate action must be taken at European level  and EU action is justified on grounds of subsidiarity. Given the need to modify Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 by providing an additional flexibility as regards the compliance periods, the objectives of this initiative cannot be achieved by the Member States themselves.  1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past  The proposal builds on existing legislation which will ensuree continuous reductions in the CO 2 emissions of the EU fleet of new heavy-duty vehciles.  1.5.4. Compatibility with the multiannual financial framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments  No additional resources required.  1.5.5. Assessment of the different available financing options, including scope for redeployment  No additional resources required.  1.6. Duration of the proposal/initiative and of its financial impact   limited duration  –  in effect from [DD/MM]YYYY to [DD/MM]YYYY  –  financial impact from YYYY to YYYY for commitment appropriations and from YYYY to YYYY for payment appropriations.   unlimited duration  – Implementation with a start-up period from YYYY to YYYY,  – followed by full-scale operation.  1.7. Method(s) of budget implementation planned 9   Direct management by the Commission  –  by its departments, including by its staff in the Union delegations;  –  by the executive agencies   Shared management with the Member States   Indirect management by entrusting budget implementation tasks to:  –  third countries or the bodies they have designated  –  international organisations and their agencies (to be specified)  –  the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund  –  bodies referred to in Articles 70 and 71 of the Financial Regulation  –  public law bodies  –  bodies governed by private law with a public service mission to the extent that they are provided with adequate financial guarantees  –  bodies governed by the private law of a Member State that are entrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership and that are provided with adequate financial guarantees  –  bodies or persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in the common foreign and security policy pursuant to Title V of the Treaty on European Union, and identified in the relevant basic act  –   bodies established in a Member State, governed by the private law of a Member State or Union law and eligible to be entrusted, in accordance with sector-specific rules, with the implementation of Union funds or budgetary guarantees, to the extent that such bodies are controlled by public law bodies or by bodies governed by private law with a public service mission, and are provided with adequate financial guarantees in the form of joint and several liability by the controlling bodies or equivalent financial guarantees and which may be, for each action, limited to the maximum amount of the Union support.  Comments  No additional resources required.  2. MANAGEMENT MEASURES  2.1. Monitoring and reporting rules  No change to the monitoring and reporting rules is introduced, since the current system also allows to monitor the application of the proposed additional fexibility.  2.2. Management and control system(s)  2.2.1. Justification of the budget implementation method(s), the funding implementation mechanism(s), the payment modalities and the control strategy proposed  The proposal is not implementing a financial programme but introducing an additional flexibility in terms of compliance by the heavy-duty vehicles manufacturers with CO 2 emissions targets. Management mode, funding implementation mechanisms, payment modalities and control strategy in relation to error rates are not applicable.  2.2.2. Information concerning the risks identified and the internal control system(s) set up to mitigate them  This proposal does not concern a spending programme. Efficient monitoring of vehicle registration data is essential for ensuring legal certainty in enforcing the legislation and for ensuring level playing field between different manufacturers.  2.2.3. Estimation and justification of the cost-effectiveness of the controls (ratio between the control costs  and the value of the related funds managed), and assessment of the expected levels of risk of error (at payment & at closure)  This initiative does not bring about new significant controls/risks that would not be covered be an existing internal control framework. No specific measures beyond the application of the Financial Regulation have been envisaged.  2.3. Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities  In addition to the application of the Financial Regulation to prevent fraud and irregularities, the additional flexibility for compliance with the CO 2 reduction requirements provided for in this proposal will be accompanied by monitoring and reporting of different datasets as provided for in Regulation (EU) 2019/1242.  3.

Overview of estimated impact on digital technology-related investments  Compulsory: the best estimate of the digital technology-related investments entailed by the proposal/initiative should be included in the table below.  Exceptionally, when required for the implementation of the proposal/initiative, the appropriations under Heading 7 should be presented in the designated line.  The appropriations under Headings 1-6 should be reflected as “Policy IT expenditure on operational programmes”. This expenditure refers to the operational budget to be used to re-use/ buy/ develop IT platforms/ tools directly linked to the implementation of the initiative and their associated investments (e.g. licences, studies, data storage etc). The information provided in this table should be consistent with details presented under Section 4 “Digital dimensions”.

Digital dimensions  The proposal does not include any digital dimension.  .  4.1. Requirements of digital relevance  Table: Row 1 — The proposal introduces a flexibility to allow manufacturers to collect emission credits if their specific CO 2 emissions are below the specific CO 2 emissions targets rather than below the CO 2 emissions reduction trajectory in 2025-2029. This means that there is no digital implications or implementation enhancement via digital tools.  4.2. Data  Table: Row 1 — N/A  4.3. Digital solutions  Table: Row 1 — N/A  4.4.

CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  The Critical Raw Materials Act (Regulation (EC) No 2024/1252) provided the EU with the objectives and a first set of tools to ensure that the EU industry has access to a secure and sustainable supply of the critical raw materials (CRMs). CRMs are needed to manufacture the strategic technologies crucial for the clean and digital transition, as well as for defence and aerospace applications. Yet, since the CRMA’s entry into force on 23 May 2024, the geopolitisation of critical raw materials supply has been heightened by a series of Chinese export restrictions on rare earths elements and other critical raw materials. In parallel, other global players have stepped up action to secure access to CRMs for their industries by financing CRM projects and diversifying their supplies through partnerships.  It is within that context that the Commission has adopted on 3 Decembre 2025 the R ES ourceEU a ction p lan to accelerate the achievement of the CRMA and reinforce the European Economic Security Communication 1 . The Action Plan contains measures on the financial de-risking and regulatory support for CRM projects with immediate diversification potential, as well as measures to operationalise its partnerships with third countries, protect the Single Market , and create a lasting market for divers if ied supplies of critical raw materials . Among the measures to meet those objectives , the Commission is proposing targeted amendments to Regulation (EC) No 2024/ 1252 (the Critical Raw Materials Act or “CRMA ”) in order to streamline, clarify and simplify some of the rules to improve circularity, in order to increase recycling capacity and to strenghten the secondary market for critical raw materials.  Firstly, the proposed amendments to the CRMA aim to create a lasting market for the Union’s raw materials value chain. For that purpose, the amendments seek to strenghten the resilience of Union industrial sectors manufacturing strategic technological products with strategic raw materials, a subset of CRMs. The ongoing implementation of the CRMA underlines that there is a risk of fragmentation of the Single Market from disparate identification by individual Member States of the large companies that have to perform risk assessment of their supply chains under Article 24 of the CRMA. This risk of fragmentation demonstrates that, when market failures lead to where companies fail to undertake mitigation strategies to limit their vulnerabilities, additional action may be warranted by the Commission. In addition to incentivising companies to invest in the resilience of their supply chains, these amendments would also drive the demand for diversified CRM supply sources.  Secondly, the imminent need to quickly increase production of CRMs require s the expansion of the circularity framework to increase the recovery and the reuse of critical raw materials , pa r ticularly for rare earth permanent magnets 2 . The Commission therefore proposes to amend the CRMA by expanding the scope of products covered by labelling and clarifying information obligations under Article 28  CRMA . For the same reasons, the Commission is also proposing to include pre-consumer waste to the recycled content obligation for rare earths permanent magnets , also in light of the fact that pre-consumeer waste is more easily recycled and currently more accessible tha n post-consumer waste.  Lastly, the Commission is proposing to introduce addition al flexibility in the number of calls required per calendar year , g iven the high number of applications per call and the need to ensure a coherent assessment of each application . This proposal is based on the Commission ’s implementation of the Article 7 of the CRMA on the selection of Strategic Projects. A first call was opened in 2024, leading to the selection of 47 Strategic Projects in the EU and 13 Strategic Projects outside of the Union 3 . A second call was launched by the Commission on 25 September 2025.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  The amendments contained in this proposal will ensure resource efficiency and support the secure and sustainable supply of CRMs. It will in particular strengthen the Union’s strategic autonomy by securing and ensuring the diversification of its supply chains. The RESourceEU Action Plan initiative reinforces other measures to advance the Union’s industrial and economic security policy goals and contributes to the objectives set out in the Communication on the Clean Industrial Deal and is closely linked to the European Economic Security Doctrine.  At the same time, the amendments will support the clean and digital transformation, by ensuring availability of essential resources used by industries of various sectors. The amendments will improve traceabilityto support end-of-life recovery and promoting the gradual uptake of recycled raw materials, thereby contributing to a coherent and aligned framework for enhancing circularity and securing the Union’s supply of CRMs.  • Consistency with other Union policies  This proposal is consistent and ensures complementarity and synergies with other Union policies.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  In line with Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the proposed regulation aims to contribute to the well-functioning of the Single Market, notably by strenghtening and clarifying the rules ensuring a secure and sustainable supply of CRMs for the Union.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  The overall objective of the proposal is to ensure uniformity and streamline certain procedures at Union level, in order to prepare large companies operating in one or more Member States, to face in the supply chains disruptions and have mitigations measures in place.  The objectives of this proposal cannot be achieved by the action of Member States alone.  • Proportionality  The proposal complies with the proportionality principle in that it does not go beyond the minimum required to achieve the stated objectives at the Union level and which is necessary for that purpose.  • Choice of the instrument  A regulation amending the CRMA Regulation is an appropriate legal instrument to implement the RESourceEU objectives.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  N/A  • Stakeholder consultations  While no formal stakeholder consultation was carried out, the proposed amendments result from technical workshops with representatives of the entire permanent magnets value chain, exchanges within the framework of the CRM Board, as well as the technical work undertaken by the Joint Research Centre in preparation for the secondary legislation under Articles 28 and 29 of the CRMA.  • Collection and use of expertise  Due to the nature of the proposed amendments and the urgency, there was no collection and use of expertise for this proposal.  • Impact assessment  Due to the urgent nature of the proposal, no impact assessment was carried out.  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  N/A  • Fundamental rights  This proposal does not have consequences for the protection of fundamental rights.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  The proposal does not have implications for the Union budget.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  This proposal amends the CRMA and includes changes to the implementation plans for Member States, in particular by removing the obligation for Member States to identify large companies and transferring this obligation to the Commission. This change simplifies and streamlines administrative procedures at Union level.  The obligations and reporting arrangements for certain companies are clarified through targeted changes to a very limited number of articles.  • Explanatory documents (for directives)  N/A  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  Article 1 amends Regulation (EU) 2024/1252.  Article 1, point (1) modifies the number of cut-off dates for open calls for applications for Strategic projects under the CRMA.  Article 1, point (2)(a), streamlines the obligation to identify large companies by tansferring it from national administrations to the Commission.  Article 1, point (2)(b) requires the Commission to notify large companies of their obligations.  Article 1, point (2)(c) clarifies the obligation for large companies and the aspects to consider for their risk preparedness assessment.  Article 1, point (2)(d) clarifies the obligations that large companies need to comply with for the mitigation measures  Article 1, point (2)(e) strengthens the obligation for large companies to maintain their board informed of the risk assessment.  Article 1, point (2)(f) allows the Commission to request information from large companies on their compliance with the risk assessment obligations, and empowers the Commission to specify if needed the mitigations measures for large companies through delegated acts.  Article 1, point (2)(g) deletes a paragraph that is not adapted anymore since the obligations under article 28 CRMA are placed on the Commission.  Article 1, point (3) expands the list of products containg permanent magnets to be considered by the Commission for their labeling.  Article 1, point (4) clarifies and expands the scope of Article 29 CRMA by including pre-consummer waste of permanent magnets to enable more comprehensive action by the Commission is more comprehensive for recycling permanent magnets.  Article 1, point (5) adapts the rules for the exercise of the delegation to include the new empowerment under Article 1, point (2)(f).  2025/0385 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulation (EU) 2024/1252  (Text with EEA relevance)  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114, thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 4 ,  Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions 5 ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) Since the entry into force of Regulation (EU) 2024/1252 on 23 May 2024, the Commission has been collectin g data and information from stakeholders and Member States concerning the implementation of it .  (2) Access to secure and sustainable c ritical raw materials is essential for the Union’s objectives of clean and digital transition as set out in the Clean Industrial Deal 6 . They are also essential components for the Union’s industries, in all areas including defence . Due to the current geopoliti cal situation the Union’s supply and security of critical raw materials is put at risk and therefore, the current framework should be strengthened.  (3) Under Regulation (EU) 2024/1252, the Commission is required to set up calls for application for Strategic Projects with at least four cut-off dates per year. Given the high number of applications for recognition of Strategic Project under each call per call received for the identification of Strategic projects of strategic critical raw material projects and to ensure a better assessment of the various applications, it should be possible for the Commission to limit the number of such calls per year.  (4) Under Regulation (EU) 2024/1252 , Member States are required to identify large companies by May 2025 and within 12 months of each update of the list of strategic raw materials pursuant to Article 3(3) . Nevertheless, large companies that use critical raw materials can operate in more than one Member State. To avoid a duplication of the identification of these large companies by the various national administrations and to prevent a risk of fragmentation of the Single Market, it should be for the Commission to identify these large companies operating in the Union.  (5) It is essential to strengthen the risk preparedness of the large companies that are identified by the Commission, i t is essential that their obligations are strengthen ed , and therefore large companies should be requir ed to take measures to mitigate their vulnerabilities, including by diversifying their raw material supply chain . The Commission should be able to receive the information regarding their compliance necessary for an effective monitoring and ensure they are prep ared in case of supply disruptio n. T he Commission should specify the m itigation measures that large companies should adopt in case of vulnerabilities , it should be able to do so by means of delegated acts.  (6) L arge companies should, as part of that risk assessment, map where the strategic raw materials they use are extracted , processed and recycled from , an d analyse the factors that could affect their supply and assess their vulnerabilities to supply disruptions. In order to have a clear understanding of their vulnerabilities, they should also map the supply chain of the components containing critical raw materials. T o reinforce their preparedness large companies should r eport on th eir risk assessment to the companies’ board of directors or management board .  (7) The Commission should continue to monitor the situation and the risk preparedness of large companies, ensuring their readiness in case of disruption of their supply chains. To that end, and when it decides so, the Commission can request information from large companies on their compliance and mitigation measures as required by this Regulation .  (8) T he recognition of pre-consumer recycled materials complements , the recovery of post-consumer waste by ensuring that manufacturers can improve short-term resource efficiency while maintaining strong incentives to build and expand end-of-life collection and recycling systems. A dditional product categories and pre-consumer waste are therefore essential to improve recycling, strengthen traceability and increase the availability of secondary materials thereby supporting the Union’s overall resource efficiency and security of supply .  (9) To attain the objectives set in the R ES ourceEU Action Plan, Regulation (EU) 2024/1252 should therefore be amended accordingly ,  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Article 1 Amendments to Regulation (EU) 2024/1252  Regulation (EU) 2024/1252 is amended as follows:  (1) i n Article 7 (3) , the second subparagraph is replaced by the following :  ‘The first such cut-off date shall be no later than 24 August 2024.

Article 2 Entry into force  This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union .  This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.  Done at Brussels,  For the European Parliament For the Council  The President The Presiden t",,,,,,,"The European Commission has proposed amendments to the Critical Raw Materials Act (CRMA) to bolster the EU's resilience and sustainability in securing essential raw materials vital for strategic technologies such as clean energy, digital transformation, and defense. This initiative is a response to geopolitical challenges, notably China's export restrictions on rare earth elements and other critical materials, which pose risks to the EU's supply chain stability. The amendments aim to establish a stable market within the EU, enhance industry resilience, and ensure consistent risk assessments across member states to prevent market fragmentation.

Key objectives include expanding the circularity framework to increase the recovery and reuse of critical materials, such as rare earth permanent magnets. This involves broadening product labeling and information obligations and incorporating pre-consumer waste into recycling requirements. The proposal also introduces flexibility in the number of strategic project calls per year, reflecting the high volume of applications and the need for thorough assessments. These changes align with the broader RESourceEU Action Plan, supporting the EU's industrial and economic security goals.

To address significant vulnerabilities to supply disruptions identified through risk assessments, large companies are required to take steps to mitigate these risks, such as diversifying their raw materials supply chains, considering secondary raw materials, or substituting strategic raw materials. These companies must present the results of their risk assessments to their board of directors or management board. The Commission may request explanations from these companies on how they comply with these obligations and can adopt delegated acts to specify risk mitigation measures based on an assessment of supply risks and trade"

EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulations (EU) 2021/694, (EU) 2021/695, (EU) 2021/697, (EU) 2021/1153, (EU) 2023/1525 and 2024/795, as regards incentivising defence-related investments in the EU budget to implement the ReArm Europe Plan  (Text with EEA relevance)  EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM  1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  President Von der Leyen announced in the Political Guidelines that a new era for defence lies ahead of us. The EU will work in the next five years to build a true European Defence Union. The last decades have exposed a chronic underinvestment and lack of efficient spending in our military capabilities, affecting the production capacities of the European defence technological and industrial base (EDTIB) and its innovation potential, while fragmenting nationally the defence market. To frame this new approach and to identify the EU investment needs, the European Commission and the High Representative presented a Joint White Paper  - European Defence Readiness 2030 on 19 March 2025.  The White Paper highlights that Member States face an acute and growing threat, requiring a coordinated reply in the spirit of solidarity. War, aggression and other hostile acts have been affecting the continent. The only way to ensure peace and deciding on the EU’s own future is to have the readiness to deter these actions. This requires strengthening the Union’s defence industry so that it can produce necessary equipment to deter potential aggressors. The EU has a strong foundation in terms of wealth and productive power to unleash resources and latent technological and industrial power. However, the current state of defence readiness is compromised by decades of under-investment in the sector, underscoring the need for a unified effort to strengthen EU defence posture.  To develop the necessary capabilities and military readiness to credibly deter armed aggression and secure the future of the EU, a massive increase in European defence spending is needed over a prolonged period. This requires a combined and sustained effort at the EU and Member States level to invest collectively in EU’s defence. This will provide the Union’s defence industry the long-term predictability it needs to invest in new production capacities.  The STEP Regulation supports EU’s competitiveness and technological advantage. Support to the development and manufacturing of certain defence technologies is today possible under STEP, including AI, cybersecurity technologies or drones.  However, the EU must do more to support the urgent need to increase European defence investments with the EU budget.  Following President von der Leyen’s letter on 4 March, addressed to the European Council, this proposal aims to extend the scope of STEP by introducing a fourth strategic sector covering all defence-related technologies and products, including those falling under the priority capability areas identified in the White Paper.  STEP could be thus leveraged to direct additional resources and investments into the defence sector, notably its technological and industrial base.  To that end, this proposal introduces modifications to the STEP Regulation, as well as to the regulations of other programmes covered by STEP: the European Defence Fund (EDF), the Digital Europe Programme (DEP) and Horizon Europe (HE). In addition, this proposal will also amend the regulation on supporting ammunition production (ASAP) and the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) to further channel EU funds towards defence industry and technologies.  The EDF amendment aims to enable cumulation of funding between the EDF and other Union programmes for the same action and introduces the possibility to transfer resources allocated to Member States under cohesion policy funds to the EDF. ASAP is also amended to enable for similar transfers from Member States and to extend the applicability of the Regulation beyond 30 June 2025.  The DEP amendment stresses the support to dual-use actions as a general and specific objective of the instrument and the possibility to use the budget flexibility to support additional well focused investments for the competitiveness and strategic autonomy of the EU.  The Horizon Europe programme amendment will enable support to technologies with potential dual-use applications under the European Innovation Council (EIC) Accelerator, as well as equity support for technologies with a focus on defence applications for scale-up. Unused amounts and potential returns from investments made by the EIC Fund during the pilot phase under Horizon 2020 should be made available in order to finance additional projects in dual use and defence benefitting from the amended scope.  Thanks to this proposal, the Commission could also award STEP Seals 1 under HE, EDF and DEP to high potential projects in the d efence sector, with the objective to attract funding from other sources (other EU funds, national funds, private or institutional investors) .  The Commission proposed on 1 April 2025 to modify the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)/Cohesion Fund (CF), Just Transition Fund (JTF) and European Social Fund + (ESF+) Regulations to further promote investments in defence as part of the mid-term review of Cohesion policy.  This proposal complements the mid-term review of Cohesion policy. The extension of the scope of STEP would allow investments on the development and manufacturing of critical technologies in defence to be supported under the existing STEP specific objectives in ERDF and CF. Similarly, skills relevant for the development/manufacturing of critical technologies in the defence sector could be supported also under STEP through the ESF+.  A coordinated approach at EU-level is needed to provide for seamless mobility for military personnel and equipment throughout Europe. CEF, as a centrally managed programme, can ensure the selection of military mobility projects with high EU added value and maturity for a fast and coordinated implementation across Member States, based on the military mobility corridors. CEF also guarantees the involvement of EU Military Staff in the selection of projects and that selected projects comply with the technical standards needed for dual-use transport infrastructure.  The proposal for the mid-term review of the Cohesion policy enables Member States to use current cohesion funding to invest in defence or dual use infrastructure to foster military mobility, benefiting from a pre-financing of 30% of the amounts programmed and the possibility to apply a Union financing of up to 100%. Those investments shall primarily focus on the four EU Priority Military Mobility Corridors. For investments in military mobility, the Communication accompanying the mid-term review of Cohesion policy encourages Member States to make use of the possibility to transfer resources allocated to them in shared management to CEF, while benefitting from the same advantageous pre- and co-financing rates as cohesion funding. An amendment to the CEF Regulation is proposed to facilitate this process.  The CEF programme amendment for the digital sector will enable the connected digital capacities required for the development of defence products and technologies, including connecting cloud, AI and AI Gigafactories.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  The proposal is consistent with the objectives followed by the EU programmes mentioned above and the cohesion policy funds. It provides targeted amendments of Regulations (EU) 2021/694, (EU) 2021/695, (EU) 2021/697, (EU) 2021/1153, (EU) 2023/1525 and (EU) 2024/795.  • Consistency with other Union policies  The proposal is limited to targeted amendments of Regulations (EU) 2021/694, (EU) 2021/695, (EU) 2021/697, (EU) 2021/1153, (EU) 2023/1525 and (EU) 2024/795 and maintains consistency with other Union policies.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  The proposal is based on Articles 114, 164, 172, 173, 175, third paragraph, 176, 177, 178, 182,183, 188, and 192 (1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  The proposal aims to encourage investments in defence by providing incentives, removing potential obstacles and ensuring greater flexibility and simplification. The same result cannot be achieved through actions at national level.  • Proportionality  The proposal aims at mobilising investments in defence and providing greater flexibility and simplification for accelerating investments. The measures do not go beyond what is necessary to achieve these goals.  • Choice of the instrument  A Regulation is the appropriate instrument as it provides directly applicable rules for the support and because amendments have to be introduced to existing Regulations.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  N/A  • Stakeholder consultations  N/A  • Collection and use of expertise  N/A  • Impact assessment  This proposal does not create a new instrument but is implemented through existing tools under the EU budget, which are amended to be able to better mobilise investment resources into defence. These existing instruments, such as Horizon Europe, Digital Europe Programme, the European Defence Fund or Connecting Europe Facility, have been subject to an impact assessment. This analysis, carried out in impact assessments or analytical staff working documents, covers the most significant impacts of this proposal. For these reasons, another impact assessment is not needed. Moreover, the limited and targeted changes do not require a separate impact assessment.  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  N/A  • Fundamental rights  N/A  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  This initiative will be financed by existing resources, within the agreed envelopes of the programmes concerned and the allocated HR.  The proposal will reinforce the envelop of the EIC by EUR 210 million from the unused amounts and reflows of the EIC pilot of Horizon 2020.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  The implementation of the measure will be monitored and reported upon in the framework of the general reporting mechanisms established under each programme and fund.  • Explanatory documents (for directives)  N/A  2025/0103 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulations (EU) 2021/694, (EU) 2021/695, (EU) 2021/697, (EU) 2021/1153, (EU) 2023/1525 and 2024/795, as regards incentivising defence-related investments in the EU budget to implement the ReArm Europe Plan  (Text with EEA relevance)  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 114, 164, 172, 173, Article 175, third paragraph, Articles 176, 177 and 178,182 183, 188, 192(1) thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 2 ,  Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions 3 ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) The unprecedented geopolitical instability and the rapid deterioration of regional and global threat levels require an urgent and significant step up of the Union spending on research and development, industrial capacity and development of infrastructures connected with security and defence. As identified in the Joint White Paper for European Defence Readiness 2030, the Union should do more to support the urgent need to increase European defence -related investments with the Union budget.  (2) The Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (STEP) established by Regulation ( EU) 2024/795 of the European P arliament and of the Council 4 is an initiative aimed at boosting U nion competitiveness by mobilizing funds from 11 existing Union programmes towards critical technologies in 3 strategic sectors: digital technologies and deep tech innovation, clean and resource-efficient technologies, and biotechnologies. As such, it is a good vehicle to mobilise, in a coordinated and synergetic manner, Union resources towards defence , including key digital frontier technologies required for the development of defence products and technologies .  (3) While support to technologies having defence implications is possible today under the 3 existing strategic sectors identified in STEP, it appears necessary to increase the potentialities of development of research, industry and innovation in the defence area by setting out a fourth strategic sector in STEP focussed on defence technologies.  This new strategic sector should ensure that the STEP incentives are used to increase Union funding in defence technologies and contribute to European competitiveness in line with STEP objectives . Defence technologies should be understood as those referred to in the A nnex to Directive 2009/43/EC and include, in particular, technologies in the areas identified by the European Council on March 6 th 2025, namely: air and missile defence , artillery systems, including deep precision strike capabilities , missiles and ammunition , drones and anti-drone systems , strategic enablers, including in relation to space and critical infrastructure protection , military mobility , cyber , artificial intelligence and electronic warfare. As regards artificial intelligence, AI Gigafactories should become key infrastructures to expand rapidly the power of AI in defence technologies.  (4) In addition, in order to optimise the capacity of the programmes covered by STEP to mobilize Union’s resources towards defence, it is necessary to clarify that these programmes can pursue objectives and activities that are related to improving the competitiveness of the European Defence Technological and In d ustrial basis ( EDTIB ) as well as research and development activities in the defence field.  (5) Horizon Europe established by Regulation (EU) 2021/ 695 of the European Parliament and of the Council 5 is the Union’s key funding programme for research and innovation. The European Innovation Council (EIC) Accelerator established by that Regulation provides support, in particular, for innovations with breakthrough potential and of a disruptive nature with scale-up potential that may be too risky for private investors. SMEs operating within the defence sector require financing for the commercialization of innovative products. However, these companies face higher barriers to access finance compared to SMEs in other sectors. Whereas the support to defence research and development is done through the European Defence Fund (EDF), which is a specific programme of Horizon Europe, it is appropriate to open the EIC Accelerator for actions with potential dual-use applications. Support to scale-up under the EIC Accelerator should also be extended to non-bankable SMEs, including start-ups and non-bankable small mid-caps, including entities which have already received support from the Accelerator carrying out breakthrough and disruptive non-bankable innovation with a focus on defence applications. This justifies a targeted exception to the principle set out in Article 7 (1) of Regulation (EU) 2021/695 of the European Parliament and of the Council according to which research and innovation activities under Horizon Europe have an exclusive focus on civil applications while not undermining the objective of ensuring unnecessary duplications.  (6) Moreover, to ensure that appropriate resources are directed to the funding of dual use and defence projects under Horizon Europe it is appropriate to derogate to Article 212(3) of the Financial Regulation in order to ensure that repayments, including reimbursed advances, revenues and unused amounts net of fees and costs of EIC blended finance investment component of the EIC pilot under Horizon 2020 are not directed to the Union budget but reinvested in the EIC Fund in order to finance additional projects in dual use and defence benefitting from the amended scope . The timeframe set out in Article 212(3) of the Financial Regulation should also be adapted, by inserting a derogation, to allow for that possibility.  (7) The European Defence Fund (EDF) set out in Regulation (EU) 2021/697 of the European Parliament and of the Council 6 , is the leading programme for enhancing the competitiveness, innovation, efficiency and technological autonomy of the Union’s defence industry. The EDF also aims at supporting actions that are conducive to developing disruptive technologies for defence. In order to better address the specificities of such actions, such as their small scale or their need for a quick support, it is app r opriate to simplify the procedure s to decide on the support of these actions while in the same time framing the conditions for the decision on such a support in the work programme . .  (8) It is also necessary to exploit synergies between EDF and other Union programmes. To that purpose, it should be possible for Member States, European Union institutions, bodies and agencies, third countries, international financial institutions or other third parties to provide voluntary contributions to the Programme , as external assigned revenues. V oluntary transfers of resources allocated to Member States in shared management to the EDF and the combination of contributions from EDF with other Union programmes for specific actions should be possible, provided that the cumulative Union support does not exceed the total eligible costs of the action.  (9) The Digital Europe Programme (DEP) established by Regulation (EU) 2021/694 of the European Parliament and of the Council 7 aims to support and accelerate the digital transformation of the European economy, industry and society and to improve the competitiveness of Europe in the global digital economy. In this context, the programme should also aim at supporting, in particular, projects, services and competences with potential dual-use application under all its specific objectives .  (10) To enhance technological sovereignty and competitiveness, the Union needs the computing, cloud and data infrastructures that AI leadership requires. As part of the AI Continent strategy, the AI factories and Gigafactories are essential for t he Union to be able to compete on the global level and ensure its strategic autonomy and competitiveness in science , dual use research and in critical industrial sectors, including the defence industry. Such next-generation models require extensive connected computing infrastructure for breakthroughs in specific domains including defence.  It is therefore appropriate to add, in the Specific Objective 1 – High Performance Computing of DEP, a supplementary operational objective dedicated to the deployment and operation of AI Factories and new generation of IA Gigafactories specialised in developing, training, and running the most complex, very large, AI models and applications, including hardware and software necessary for such deployment.  (11) In the specific Objective 5 of DEP – Deployment and Best Use of Digital Capacity and interoperability, it is also necessary to add, in the operational objective defined to support the public sector and areas of public interest, a reference to defence in order to clarify that the financial contribution of the Union under such an Objective can be extended to that sector.  (12) It is also necessary to adapt the eligibility rules that might be set out in the work programme of DEP so that it is possible to provide that legal entities established in associated countries and legal entities that are established in the Union but are controlled from third countries are not eligible to participate in all or some actions focused on technologies with dual-use potential under any specific objective . In such cases, calls for proposals and calls for tenders should be restricted to legal entities established or deemed to be established in Member States and controlled by Member States or by nationals of Member States.  (13) Regulation (EU) 2023 / 1525 of the European Parliament and of the Council supporting ammunition production (ASAP) 8 was adopted to financially support the urgent strengthening of the EDTIB responsiveness and ability to ensure the timely availability and supply of ground-to-ground and artillery ammunition as well as missiles. Voluntary transfers of resources allocated to Member States in shared management to the ASAP instrument as well as additional voluntary contributions from Member States or other relevant stakeholders should contribute to pursue the support to ramping up the Union’s manufacturing capacities beyond 30 June 2025. Regulation (EU) 2023/1525 should therefore be amended to introduce such a possibility. Since that Regulation has shown is usefulness to develop new production capacities of powder/propellant, explosives, shells, testing capacity, and missiles all across the Union, it is appropriate to ensure that its applica tion is extended until 31 December 2026.  (14) The Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) set out in Regulation (EU) 2021/1153 of the European Parliament and of the Council , 9 aims to accelerate investment in the field of trans-European networks, enabling synergies between the transport, energy and digital sectors. In order to support the connected computing infrastructure required by defence products and technologies and beyond these area s , the objectives of the CEF digital sector within that Regulation should be extended to the deployment and provision of digital capacities such as cloud, AI and AI Gigafactories.  (15) Military mobility is also one of the objectives of the CEF programme. The Joint White Paper for European Defence Readiness 2030 recognised military mobility as an essential enabler for European security and defence and stressed the Union added-value in supporting dual-use infrastructure for mobility. The mid-term review of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the Cohesion Fund both established by Regulation (EU) 2021/1058 of the European Parliament and of the Council 10 introduced the possibility to invest in defence or dual use infrastructure to foster military mobility benefiting from a pre-financing of 30% of the amounts programmed and the possibility to apply a Union financing of up to 100%. In case s where Member States transfer resources allocated to them in shared management to CEF they should benefit from the same conditions on pre-financing and co-financing for dual-use transport infrastructure projects as introduced in the ERDF and Cohesion Fund. In such a case, these amounts should be reserved to projects developing the Military Mobility corridors as identified by the Member States in Military Requirements for Military Mobility within and beyond the Union as well as digital connectivity and capacities..  (16) Regulations (EU) 2021/694, (EU) 2021/695, (EU) 2021/697, (EU) 2021/1153, (EU) 2023/1525 and (EU) 2024/795 should therefor e be amended accordingly .  (17) Given the urgent need to enable crucial investments in defence in the context of pressing geopolitical challenges, this Regulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.  (18) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely to strengthen research and development activities in dual use and defence, improve the competitiveness of the Union’s defence industry and therefore contribute to the Union’s defence by refocus ing investments of these critical priorities, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but can rather be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 TEU. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives ,  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Article 1  Regulation (EU) 2021/694 [Digital Europe Programme] is amended as follows:  (1) in Article 3 (1), second subparagraph, the following point is added:  ‘(c) support dual-use projects, services, competences and applications.’;  (2) in Article 4 (1) the following point is added:  ‘(d) deploy and operate AI Factories and new generation AI Gigafactories specialised in developing, training, and running the most complex, very large, AI models and applications, including hardware and software necessary for such deployment.’;  (3) in Article 8 (1),  point (a) is replaced by the following:  ‘(a) support the public sector and areas of public interest, such as health and care, education, judiciary, customs, defence, transport, mobility, energy, environment, cultural and creative sectors, including relevant businesses established within the Union, to effectively deploy and access state-of-the-art digital technologies, such as HPC, quantum, AI and cybersecurity;’;  (4) in Article 12, paragraph 5 is replaced by the following:  ‘5.

FRAMEWORK OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE  1.1. Title of the proposal/initiative  Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council Amending Regulations (EU) 2021/694, (EU) 2021/695, (EU) 2021/697, (EU) 2021/1153, (EU) 2023/1525 and 2024/795 as regards incentivising defence-related investments in the EU budget to implement the ReArm Europe Plan.  1.2. Policy area(s) concerned  A new era for European Defence and Security  1.3. Objective(s)  1.3.1. General objective(s)  To incentivise defence-related investments in the EU budget and strengthen the EU's defence industry and technological base in line with the ReArm Europe Plan.  1.3.2. Specific objective(s)  · To enable the extension of the Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (STEP) to cover defence-related technologies and products, and to strengthen the EU's strategic autonomy in the defence sector.  · To amend the European Defence Fund (EDF) to 1) better exploit synergies with other Union programmes by allowing for the combination of EDF contributions with other Union programmes for specific actions; 2) allowing for voluntary transfers of resources allocated to Member States in shared management to the EDF ; 3) streamline the evaluation and funding process the development of disruptive technologies for defence..  · To amend the Act in Support of Ammunition Production (ASAP) Regulation to 1) introduce the possibility of voluntary transfers of resources allocated to Member States in shared management to ASAP, as well as additional voluntary contributions from Member States or other relevant stakeholders; 2) extend the application of the ASAP Regulation until 31 December 2026 to ensure continued support for the development of new production capacities for ammunition and related products.  · To amend the Digital Europe Programme (DEP) to enhance its focus on strategic autonomy and competitiveness, and better support dual-use technologies and applications. This includes the deployment of digital infrastructure such as artificial intelligence, high-performance computing, and cybersecurity, e.g. through the development of AI Factories and Gigafactories. The amendment will also ensure that the programme's funding is used in a way that aligns with the EU's strategic interests, including by adapting eligibility rules for dual-use actions.  · To amend Horizon Europe to enable support to projects with potential dual-use applications under the European Innovation Council (EIC) Accelerator, as well as projects with a focus on defence applications under the EIC STEP scale-up.  · To amend the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) to extend its digital sector objectives to include the deployment and provision of digital capacities such as cloud, AI, and AI Gigafactories, and to contribute to the development of projects of common interest relating to efficient, interconnected and multimodal networks and infrastructure for smart, interoperable, sustainable, inclusive, accessible, safe and secure mobility in accordance with the objectives of Regulation (EU) No 1315/2013.  1.3.3. Expected result(s) and impact  Specify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.  The proposed mini-omnibus regulation is expected to have the following effects on the beneficiaries and groups targeted:  Increased investments in defence: the proposal will provide Member States with more flexibility to use the EU budget to address their defence needs, leading to a significant increase in defence investments, in line with the objectives of the ReArm Europe Plan.  Enhanced European defence technological and industrial base (EDTIB): by supporting the development of defence and dual-use technologies, the proposal will enable the EU to reduce its dependence on non-EU suppliers and strengthen its strategic autonomy, ultimately strengthening the EDTIB.  Improved military readiness, capabilities, and mobility: the proposal will enable Member States to meet their defence capability gaps, develop the necessary military readiness to credibly deter armed aggression, and enhance military mobility across the continent, including through the develoment of Military Mobility corridors. The new pre- and co-financing rates for dual-use transport infrastructure projects should serve as incentives for Member States to transfer ressources from shared management to CEF, enabling a coordinated approach to military mobility investments across Member States and contributing to the objectives of the Joint White Paper for European Defence Readiness 2030.  Support to SMEs and start-ups: by opening the European Innovation Council (EIC) Accelerator and EIC Scale Up to dual-use and defence technologies, the proposal will promote innovation and competitiveness in the EU, strengthen the EDTIB, and provide opportunities for SMEs and start-ups to develop and grow.  Increased synergies with other sectors: the proposal will facilitate increased synergies between defence and other sectors, such as digital, by enabling the financing of initiatives like AI Factories and AI Gigafactories, as well asdual-use projects with potential spill-over effects for innovation and competitiveness in areas like research, technology, and industry.  These expected results and impacts will benefit various stakeholders , including:  - Member States, by providing greater flexibility to use EU funding in support of security and defence  - The EU defence industry, including SMEs and start-ups, by providing opportunities for growth and innovation and strengthening the EDTIB.  - EU citizens, by contributing to peace, security and strategic autonomy  1.3.4. Indicators of performance  Specify the indicators for monitoring progress and achievements.  Table: Row 1 — Specific Objective; Indicator Row 2 — Enhanced European defence technological and industrial base (EDTIB) and supply chain resilience; Number of defence projects supported by STEP Row 3 — Improved military mobility; Number of transport infrastructure components adapted to dual-use requirements Row 4 — Support to defence innovation Support to SMEs and start-ups developing dual use and defence technologies; Time reduction in evaluation and award of EDF projects related to disruptive technologies for defence Number of defence and dual use SMEs and start-ups receiving funding through the European Innovation Council (EIC) Accelerator and EIC STEP Scale Up Row 5 — Increased synergies with other sectors, such as digital; Number of projects funded through DEP that have a dual-use or defence component  1.4. The proposal/initiative relates to:   a new action   a new action following a pilot project / preparatory action 11   the extension of an existing action   a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action  1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative  1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative  The proposal aims to address the need for increased and swift investments in defence and the development of a strong and competitive EDTIB, in line with the ReArm Europe Plan. It aims to introduce changes to existing EU programmes, including STEP, Horizon Europe, EDF, ASAP, DEP, and CEF, to support defence and dual-use initiatives. The targeted amendments to EU Regulations will take effect immediately following the adoption of the proposed Regulation. Where relevant, they should be taken into account for the preparation and/or amendment of existing Work Programmes of relevant initiatives (Horizon Europe, CEF, DEP, STEP, EDF). This will enable the launch of new calls for proposals and the selection of projects that align with the EU and MS defence and security objectives.  Timeline for implementation:  The implementation timeline for the mini-omnibus regulation will be influenced by the existing programme cycles and the need to incorporate the changes into the respective work programmes. For most programmes, the changes are expected to be introduced in the next available work programme, with the first calls for proposals launched shortly thereafter.  For amendments that introduce the possibility for Member States to channel cohesion policy funds towards defence-related investments (including CEF, STEP, EDF, ASAP), in order to benefit from the additional pre-financing of 30% of the amounts programmed, Member States should submit their programme amendments by the end of 2025.  1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, greater effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this section 'added value of EU involvement' is the value resulting from EU action, that is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.  The added value of EU action lies in its ability to coordinate investments, maximise budget efficiency, and achieve greater effectiveness in supporting defence investments than would be possible for any individual Member State acting alone. The EU's role in promoting a coordinated approach to defence investment enables MS to address their defence needs, which is essential for ensuring the security and stability of the EU and its Member States.  Reasons for action at EU level (ex-ante):  – The need for coordinated investment in defence to address common security challenges and threats, which cannot be effectively addressed by individual Member States alone.  – The importance of maximising budget efficiency, maximjising complementarity of different funding programmes and reducing duplication of efforts, which can be achieved through EU-level coordination and cooperation.  Reasons for action at EU level (ex-ante):  – Support defence readiness and enhance military mobility, which will strengthen MS ability to respond to common security challenges and threats.  – Increased competitiveness and innovation in the European defence industry, resulting from the EU's coordinated approach to defence investment and the development of a strong and competitive European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB).  – Maximisation of synergies among different EU financial instruments and enhanced sclae and scope, which will enable the EU to leverage its resources more effectively and achieve greater impact with its investments that individual MS, particularly for large scale projects.  – Better value for money, resulting from the efficient use of resources and reduced duplication of efforts, which will enable the EU to achieve more with its available resources. By combining the resources and expertise of different EU programmes, the EU can create a more comprehensive and integrated approach to defence investment, which will yield greater benefits and returns than could be achieved through individual programmes alone.  1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past  The EU has a track record of successfully adapting its funding instrumentsto respond to emerging challenges and priorities. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the EU introduced several instruments to support the recovery and resilience of affected regions and communities, including the Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative (CRII) and CRII+, as well as REACT-EU (Recovery Assistance for Cohesion and the Territories of Europe). Additionally, in response to the Russia-Ukraine war and the resulting energy price crisis, the EU proposed a more flexible use of its funding instruments to help Member States address various challenges.  These experiences have shown that adapting EU funding instruments can be an effective way to respond to evolving challenges and strategic priorities.. They have also highlighted the importance of close coordination and cooperation between the European Commission, Member States, and relevant authorities to ensure that funds are used effectively and efficiently.  In the context of defence investment, the EU can draw on these lessons to ensure that the adaptation of its funding instruments is done in a way that is transparent, accountable, and effective. By building on these past experiences, the EU can create a more flexible and responsive framework that is better equipped to address the complex and evolving security challenges facing the EU and its Member States.  1.5.4. Compatibility with the multiannual financial framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments  The proposed targeted amendments to the relevant EU Regulations are fully compatible with the existing Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) 2021-2027. The amendments do not requireadditional funding from the EU budget at allnor do they alter  the overall budget allocation for most of the programmes, as they are designed to optimize the use of existing resources within the current programmes. The proposed flexibilities and synergies among different EU financial instruments, such as STEP, EDF, ASAP, CEF, and DEP, are also fully consistent with the existing MFF. However, to achieve the objectives of the mini-omnibus proposal, additional resources originated by reflows from the EIC pilot in the previous MFF under Horizon 2020 will be allocated to Horizon Europe, specifically for the European Innovation Council. This targeted reinforcement will support the development of innovative defence and dual-use technologies, and will be implemented within the existing MFF framework.  The proposed amendments could help inform the future MFF by providing valuable insights and lessons learned from the implementation of the current programmes. The experience gained from the flexibilisation of cohesion funds and the creation of synergies among different EU financial instruments could be taken into account when designing future EU programmes and budget allocations. This could help to ensure that future EU funding is more effective, efficient, and better aligned EU strategic priorities, including defence and security.  1.5.5. Assessment of the different available financing options, including scope for redeployment  The proposed targeted amendments to the relevant EU Regulations offer a range of financing options and opportunities for redeployment, which could help to optimize the use of existing resources and support the development of defence capabilities and technologies in the EU.  One of the financing options is the possibility of channeling cohesion funds to support defence-related investments and activities, e.g. thorugh STEP.  The European Defence Fund (EDF) amendment aims to enable cumulation of funding between the EDF and other Union programmes for the same action, allowing for a more comprehensive and integrated approach to supporting defence-related investments. Additionally, the amendment provides for the possibility to transfer resources allocated to Member States under cohesion policy funds to the EDF, which would enable Member States to redirect their cohesion policy funds to support defence-related investments. Moreover, the ASAP amendment will enable voluntary transfers of resources allocated to Member States under cohesion policy funds to the ASAP instrument, as well as additional voluntary contributions from Member States.  The Digital Europe Programme (DEP) amendment provides for the possibility to use the budget flexibility to support additional well-focused investments for the competitiveness and strategic autonomy of the EU, including dual use.  The Horizon Europe programme amendment will enable support to projects with potential dual-use applications under the European Innovation Council (EIC) Accelerator (grant + equities), as well as projects with a focus on defence applications under the EIC Accelerator scale-up scheme (equity only).  The CEF amendment will enable the connected digital capacities required for the development of defence products and technologies, including connecting cloud, AI, and AI Gigafactories, as well as military mobility. This will support the development of infrastructure and technologies that are essential for security and defence. In CEF, the military mobility envelope (EUR 1.7 billion) has been fully allocated to projects in 2024 after three calls or proposals. Transfers of Member States from resources under shared management are therefore an option to support further military mobility projects under CEF.  1.6.

Comments  The method of budget implementation will depend on the specific programme affected by the amendment. In particular:  For Horizon Europe/EIC Accelerator, implementation is expected to be through executive agencies (notably EISMEA); the EIC Fund is managed by the European Investment Bank.  For STEP, CEF, DEP, EDF, and ASAP, direct management is foreseen.  For CEF, the programme is implemented through direct management and fully delegated to the European Climate, Infrastructure and Environment Executive Agency (CINEA). Some programme support actions are managed directly by the Commission  For Cohesion Policy, shared management with MS will apply.  2. MANAGEMENT MEASURES  2.1. Monitoring and reporting rules  The targeted amendments in the Regulation will be monitored and evaluated in accordance with the rules and procedures established in the relevant programmes, namely Horizon Europe, CEF, DEP, EDF, ASAP, and STEP. The frequency and conditions for monitoring and reporting will be as specified in the respective programme regulations and agreements.  Additionally, for provisions related to Cohesion Policy, periodical evaluation and reporting will be conducted in line with the relevant Cohesion Policy obligations, including the requirements for ex-ante evaluations, interim evaluations, and ex-post evaluations, as well as the reporting requirements set out in the applicable regulations and funding agreements.  In general, the monitoring and reporting will be carried out on a regular basis, with the specific frequency and conditions to be determined by the relevant programme authorities and in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations.  2.2. Management and control system(s)  2.2.1. Justification of the budget implementation method(s), the funding implementation mechanism(s), the payment modalities and the control strategy proposed  The proposed budget implementation methods, funding implementation mechanisms, payment modalities, and control strategy are based on the existing structures and mechanisms already in place for the relevant programmes (Horizon Europe, CEF, DEP, EDF, ASAP, STEP).  The amendments introduced by this Regulation do not introduce any alterations in this regard. Instead, they build upon existing frameworks designed to ensure effective, efficient, and economical implementation of the programmes.  The use of direct management, shared management, and executive agencies, as well as the funding implementation mechanisms and control strategies have been established and tested in the context of the existing programmes. The proposed amendments do not require significant changes to these existing structures. The Commission will rely on the existing expertise, systems, and procedures to implement the amended programmes.  The control strategy, including the risk-based approach, ex-ante, interim, and ex-post controls, audits, and evaluations, will continue to be applied in accordance with the existing rules and regulations under relevant programmes. The Commission will continue to monitor and report on the implementation of the programmes, including the amended provisions, in accordance with the existing requirements and procedures.  2.2.2. Information concerning the risks identified and the internal control system(s) set up to mitigate them  The internal control systems in place for the existing programmes (Horizon Europe, CEF, DEP, EDF, ASAP, STEP) have been designed to identify and mitigate risks, including the risk of errors and irregularities.  The amendments introduced by this Regulation do not fundamentally alter the risk landscape of the existing programmes. The Commission will continue to rely on the existing internal control systems, which have been established to ensure the effective and efficient implementation of the programmes.  2.2.3. Estimation and justification of the cost-effectiveness of the controls (ratio between the control costs  and the value of the related funds managed), and assessment of the expected levels of risk of error (at payment & at closure)  The cost-effectiveness of the controls for the amended programmes is expected to be in line with the existing programmes. The Commission will continue to rely on the existing control systems, which have been established to ensure the effective and efficient implementation of the programmes, as the amendments do not introduce significant changes to programmes.  The Commission will continue to monitor and report on the implementation of the programmes, including the amended provisions, in accordance with the existing requirements and procedures.  2.3. Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities  The Commission will continue to apply the measures envisaged under the programmes affected by the proposed Regulation to prevent fraud and irregularities, including measures are outlined in the Commission's anti-fraud strategy.  The amended programmes will also be subject to the Commission's overall anti-fraud framework, which includes regular monitoring and reporting on fraud risks and incidents. The Commission will continue to work closely with the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) and other relevant authorities to prevent and investigate fraud and irregularities.  No additional measures are envisaged at this stage, as the existing measures are considered to be adequate to prevent fraud and irregularities in the amended programmes.  3.

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 164 and 172, Article 173(3) , Article 175, third paragraph, Articles ▌177 and 178, Article 182(1) and (4), Article 183, Article 188, second paragraph, and Article 192(1) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1) ,
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions (2) ,
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (3) ,
Whereas:
(1)  Unprecedented geopolitical instability and the rapid deterioration of regional and global levels of threat and security, in particular Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified war of aggression against Ukraine, which has exposed the Union and its Member States to a high risk of materialisation of conventional military threats, require an urgent and significant increase in the Union’s spending on research , innovation and development, industrial capacity and development of infrastructure connected with resilience, security and defence. The European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB) faces persistent barriers in accessing finance, in particular private finance for investment, due to the risks that market actors associate with such investment. As a consequence, leveraging public defence-related investment is vital. Therefore, as identified in the Joint White Paper of the Commission and of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy of 19 March 2025 for European Defence Readiness 2030 (the ‘Joint White Paper’), which provides a framework for the ReArm Europe Plan, the Union should do more to support the urgent need to increase European defence-related investment with the Union budget , alongside increases in national defence spending by the Member States .
The leveraging of Union funding programmes to support dual-use and defence-related technologies and products serves as a step towards European defence readiness. Such leveraging is also intended to enhance civil-military cooperation across Member States, in light of mutually beneficial spill-over effects. The actions supported by the Union programmes concerned could duly take into account the relevant activities carried out by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and other partners where such activities serve the Union's security and defence interests.
(2) Investment in the development of cutting-edge dual-use and defence capabilities should be promoted, since such investment contributes to the Union’s broader societal resilience, security and competitiveness objectives. The development of dual-use and defence industries throughout the Union, taking into account the risks associated with the increased deterioration of the Union’s security context, is essential to ensuring that all Member States contribute to and benefit from a robust and resilient EDTIB.
(3)  The Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (STEP), established by Regulation (EU) 2024/795 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) , is an initiative aiming to boost Union competitiveness by mobilising funds from 11 existing Union programmes towards critical technologies in three strategic sectors: digital technologies and deep-tech innovation, clean and resource-efficient technologies, and biotechnologies. As such, STEP is a good vehicle to mobilise, in a coordinated and synergetic manner, Union resources towards defence, including key digital frontier technologies required for the development of defence products and technologies.
(4)  While support to technologies having defence implications is possible today under the three existing strategic sectors identified in STEP, it appears necessary to increase the potentialities of development of research, industry and innovation in the defence sector by establishing a fourth strategic sector in STEP, focused on defence technologies without compromising the Union’s intended technological leadership in the existing sectors. This fourth strategic sector should ensure that STEP incentives are used to increase Union funding in innovative defence technologies with the aim of responding effectively to current and emerging threats and of contributing to European competitiveness in line with the STEP objectives. Defence technologies should be understood as those embodied in, or necessary for the development and manufacturing of, defence products, including defence-related products referred to in the Annex to Directive 2009/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (5) . Consistent with the approach applied to the other three sectors set out in Article 2(1) , point (a), of Regulation (EU) 2024/795, the Commission should update the guidance provided for in that Regulation to cover the fourth strategic sector, including on the interpretation of defence technologies ▌. As regards artificial intelligence, AI Gigafactories should become key infrastructure for the purpose of a rapid expansion of the power of AI in defence technologies.
(5)  In addition, in order to optimise the capacity of the programmes covered by STEP to mobilise the Union’s resources towards defence needs , it is necessary to clarify that those programmes are able to pursue objectives and activities that are related to improving the competitiveness and resilience of the EDTIB as well as research and development activities in the defence area.
(6)  Horizon Europe, which was established by Regulation (EU) 2021/695 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6) , is the Union’s ▌funding programme for research and innovation , playing a pivotal role in the global scientific and technological leadership of the Union . The European Innovation Council (EIC) Accelerator established by that Regulation provides support, in particular, for innovations with breakthrough potential, and of a disruptive nature with scale-up potential, which may be too risky for private investors. Small or medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) , start-ups and some small mid-cap enterprises operating within the defence sector require financing for the commercialisation of innovative products.
However, such legal entities face higher barriers for access to finance, compared to legal entities in other sectors . As highlighted in the Joint White Paper, it is necessary to increase European defence readiness, because Europe is currently being affected by war, aggression and other hostile acts. For that purpose, a substantial increase in support to high-impact, defence-related innovation, including much-needed support to SMEs, start-ups and some small mid-caps willing to scale up such high-impact defence-related innovations, is needed. However, the current architecture of Union programmes, including the European Defence Fund (EDF), does not provide the scale, flexibility or speed required to mobilise such support in an effective and timely manner. The current architecture might create uncertainties for the legal entities in the defence sector with regard to the access to support for technologies with potential dual-use applications. Given the severity of the threat in the current environment, extraordinary measures are justified and necessary .
While support for defence research and development is carried out through the EDF, which is a specific programme of Horizon Europe, it is appropriate , on the basis of the current strategic context, to open the EIC Accelerator to actions with potential dual-use applications , while advancing civilian application use . Support to scale-ups under the EIC Accelerator STEP Scale-up Scheme (the ‘Scheme’) should also be extended to non-bankable SMEs, including start-ups and non-bankable small mid-caps, such as entities which have already received support from the Accelerator carrying out breakthrough and disruptive non-bankable innovation in critical defence technologies while fostering, where appropriate, innovations with dual-use potential. Scale-up support in the form of direct equity investment, whereby funding is provided directly to companies, is not available under existing defence-focused funding instruments, in particular the EDF and the Defence Equity Facility deployed under InvestEU.
The opening of the Scheme to innovation in critical defence technologies is therefore necessary to support legal entities investing in the defence sector, while ensuring complementarity with other existing Union instruments . This justifies establishing a targeted exception within the current Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) to the principle set out in Article 7(1) of Regulation (EU) 2021/695, which provides that research and innovation activities under Horizon Europe have an exclusive focus on civil applications, while avoiding unnecessary duplication. The targeted exception is without prejudice to the outcome of the upcoming negotiations in the context of the next MFF. The Commission should ensure proper oversight of the application of the targeted exception, including through the collection and reporting of appropriate data in the context of the existing monitoring and evaluation of the EIC, without creating additional administrative burdens for participants.
(7) As innovation activities with dual-use applications could affect Union strategic assets, interests, autonomy or security or strategic interests of the Union and its Member States, it may be necessary to adapt, in the relevant work programmes under Horizon Europe, the eligibility rules to enable participation to be limited to legal entities established only in Member States or to legal entities established in specified associated countries in addition to Member States, or to exclude the participation of legal entities that are established in the Union or in associated countries and that are directly or indirectly controlled by non-associated third countries or by legal entities of non-associated third countries. Article 48(2) of Regulation (EU) 2021/695 should therefore be amended to allow for such a possibility. The possibility to adapt the eligibility rules in the relevant work programmes is specific to new innovation activities that have dual-use applications and does not affect the rules governing support to activities with civilian applications under Horizon Europe or the funding of such activities.
(8) As innovation activities in critical defence technologies may significantly affect the security and defence interests of the Union and its Member States, it is necessary to establish specific eligibility rules which ensure consistency with other Union instruments in the defence industry sector and which take into account Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine.
Such specific eligibility rules should limit participation to legal entities established in the Union, in Ukraine, or in a member of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) which is a member of the European Economic Area (EEA member) and which is associated to Horizon Europe. Those rules should exclude the participation of legal entities that are directly or indirectly controlled by a third country other than Ukraine or an EEA member associated to Horizon Europe, or by legal entities of such a third country. However, a legal entity established in the Union or in an EEA member associated to Horizon Europe and which is controlled by a third country other than Ukraine or an EEA member associated to Horizon Europe, or by a legal entity of a third-country other than Ukraine or an EEA member associated to Horizon Europe should be eligible to be a beneficiary, provided that guarantees approved in accordance with the national procedures of the Member State or the EEA member in which the legal entity is established are made available to the Commission.
(9) Recognising the urgent and extraordinary need to further strengthen the Union’s sovereignty and security as provided for in Regulation (EU) 2024/795 , and in order to ensure the rapid mobilisation and reinvestment of financial resources in critical sectors, including dual-use and defence projects under the EIC Accelerator under Horizon Europe , it is appropriate to derogate from Article 212(3) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7) (the ‘Financial Regulation’) . Given those circumstances and the need for a rapid availability of funds, it is particularly necessary to allow for repayments, including reimbursed advances, revenues and unused amounts net of the fees and costs of the EIC blended finance investment component of the EIC Pilot under Horizon 2020 to be reinvested in the EIC Fund rather than directed to the Union budget , in order to finance projects with civil applications, as well as projects in dual-use and defence that benefit from the amended scope ▌. The timeframe set out in Article 212(3) of the Financial Regulation should be amended to ensure meaningful implementation under exceptional circumstances To allow for that possibility, it is necessary to introduce a derogation from that provision .
(10)  The EDF, established by Regulation (EU) 2021/697 of the European Parliament and of the Council (8) , is the leading programme for enhancing the competitiveness, innovation, efficiency and technological autonomy of the Union’s defence industry. The EDF aims to support actions that are conducive to developing disruptive technologies for defence. In order to better address the specificities of such actions, such as if they have a particularly small scale or particular need for quick support, it is appropriate to significantly shorten and simplify the procedures to decide on the support for those actions, while at the same time framing the conditions for the decision on such support in the work programme and without undermining the principle of excellence .
(11)  It is also necessary to exploit synergies between the EDF and other Union programmes. To that end, it should be possible for Member States, Union institutions, bodies and agencies, third countries, international financial institutions or other third parties to provide voluntary contributions to the EDF, as external assigned revenues. Voluntary transfers of resources allocated to Member States in shared management to the EDF and the combination of contributions from the EDF with other Union programmes for specific actions should be possible, provided that cumulative Union support does not exceed the total eligible costs of the action.
(12) On 23 June 2022, the European Council decided to grant the status of candidate country to Ukraine, which expressed a strong will to link reconstruction with reforms on its European path. On 15 December 2023, the European Council decided to open accession negotiations with Ukraine and declared that the Union and its Member States remain committed to contributing, for the long-term and together with partners, to security commitments to Ukraine which will help the latter to defend itself, resist destabilisation efforts and deter acts of aggression in the future. Strong support to Ukraine is a key priority for the Union and an appropriate response to the Union’s strong political commitment to support Ukraine for as long as necessary.
On 5 March 2023, the Commission proposed to create an Instrument (the ‘Ukraine Support Instrument’) to address the damage caused by Russia’s war of aggression to the Ukrainian Defence Technological and Industrial Base (the ‘Ukrainian DTIB’) and to support its reconstruction, recovery and modernisation, taking into account its possible future integration into the EDTIB. The Ukrainian DTIB has significantly developed its research, development and innovation capacities since the beginning of the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine in order to address the needs of the Ukrainian armed forces. In that context, ensuring a closer cooperation between the EDTIB and the Ukrainian DTIB would allow access by the EDTIB to those capabilities and would contribute to the objective of fostering the competitiveness and innovation of the EDTIB, while being consistent with the continuous support of the Union to the strengthening of the defence manufacturing capacities of Ukraine. Accordingly, in light of the common objectives and goals of the Union and Ukraine in the area of defence research and development and in light of the benefits for both sides which can be expected from a closer integration in that regard, it is appropriate to associate Ukraine to the EDF.
(13)  The Digital Europe Programme (DEP), established by Regulation (EU) 2021/694 of the European Parliament and of the Council (9) , aims to support and accelerate the digital transformation of the European economy, industry and society and to improve the competitiveness of Europe in the global digital economy. In that context, the programme should aim to support, in particular, projects, services and competences with potential dual-use application under all its specific objectives. This would contribute to strengthening the Union's societal resilience in the face of ongoing hybrid attacks and foreign interference. Recognising the strategic importance of cross-border cooperation and the facilitation of technology transfers between Member States in dual-use projects in the digital sector, the Commission should take into account the trans-European dimension when awarding dual-use projects. It is therefore appropriate to make this award criterion mandatory for dual-use projects.
(14)  To enhance technological sovereignty and competitiveness, the Union needs the computing, cloud and data infrastructure required by AI leadership. As part of the AI Continent strategy, the AI factories and AI Gigafactories are essential to enable the Union to compete at the global level and ensure its strategic autonomy and competitiveness in science, ▌in research with dual-use potential and in critical industrial sectors, including the defence industry. Next-generation AI models require extensive connected computing infrastructure for breakthroughs in specific domains including defence. It is therefore appropriate to add, in Specific Objective 1 – High Performance Computing of DEP, a supplementary operational objective dedicated to the deployment and operation of AI Factories and new generation of AI Gigafactories specialised in developing, training, and running the most complex, very large, AI models and applications, including hardware and software necessary for such deployment.
(15) The intensifying exposure to cyber and hybrid threats in the Union justifies adding an explicit focus on resilience against cyber and hybrid threats under Specific Objective 3 of DEP. In Specific Objective 5 of DEP, Deployment and Best Use of Digital Capacity and Interoperability, it is also necessary to add, in the operational objective defined to support the public sector and areas of public interest, a reference to defence in order to clarify that the financial contribution of the Union under such an objective can be extended to that sector.
(16)  It may also be necessary to adapt the eligibility rules in the work programme of DEP for specific and duly justified cases, so that legal entities established in associated countries or established in the Union but controlled from third countries, are not eligible to participate in all or some actions focused on technologies with dual-use potential under any specific objective. Provision should therefore be made to allow for such a possibility. In such cases, calls for proposals and calls for tenders should be restricted to legal entities established or deemed to be established in the Union and controlled by Member States or by nationals of Member States.
▌
(17)  The Connecting Europe Facility (CEF), established by Regulation (EU) 2021/1153 of the European Parliament and of the Council ▌ (10) , aims to accelerate investment in the field of trans-European networks, enabling synergies between the transport, energy and digital sectors. In order to support the connected computing infrastructure required by defence products and technologies and beyond those areas, the objectives of the CEF digital sector within that Regulation should be extended to the deployment and provision of digital capacities such as cloud, AI , AI factories and AI Gigafactories.
(18)  ▌The Joint White Paper recognised military mobility as an essential enabler for European security and defence and stressed the Union added-value in supporting dual-use infrastructure for mobility. In the context of the Joint White Paper, the Commission and the High Representative recognised the importance of identifying military mobility hot spot projects and of removing key gaps and bottlenecks along the four EU Priority Military Mobility Corridors. Military mobility is also one of the objectives of the CEF. The Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) policy serves as a key strategic instrument in building the Union’s cross-border transport infrastructure. Although originally intended for civilian purposes, it also holds a remarkable potential for civilian-defence dual use. Moreover, the Niinistö report of 30 October 2024 on Strengthening Europe’s Civilian and Military Preparedness and Readiness specifically refers to the need to intensify further work on priority dual-use transport corridors for military movements and the extension of fuel-supply chains for the armed forces along those corridors. Given the importance of strengthening the dual-use transport infrastructure ▌in light of the deteriorating security context of the Union, it is appropriate to clarify that specific activities within actions under Specific Objective 3(2) of the CEF may, where relevant, include measures to safeguard the dual-use transport infrastructure with regard to military counter-mobility or to provide fuel infrastructure for civilian-defence dual use .
(19) The mid-term review of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the Cohesion Fund, both established by Regulation (EU) 2021/1058 of the European Parliament and of the Council (11) , introduced the possibility to invest in defence or dual-use infrastructure to foster military mobility benefiting from a pre-financing of 20 % of the amounts programmed and the possibility to apply a Union financing increased by 10 percentage points above the co-financing rate applicable, not exceeding 100 %. Where Member States transfer resources allocated to them in shared management to the CEF, they should benefit from the same conditions on pre-financing and co-financing rates for dual-use transport infrastructure projects as introduced in the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund. In such a case, those amounts should be reserved to projects developing the EU Priority Military Mobility Corridors identified by the Member States in Annex II to the Military Requirements for Military Mobility within and beyond the EU, as approved by the Council on 17 March 2025, or any later version of that annex approved by the Council, as well as digital connectivity and capacities, including logistics hubs and cross-border sections of those corridors. The Financial Regulation provides for a possibility to introduce conditions for participation in specific award procedures which affect security and public order.
Accordingly, it should be possible to provide for such specific conditions in relation to actions located on one or more of the EU Priority Military Mobility Corridors, including conditions relating to the country of origin of the equipment, goods, supplies or service.
(20)  Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely to strengthen research and development activities in dual-use and defence, improve the competitiveness of the Union’s defence industry and therefore contribute to the Union’s defence readiness by refocusing investment of these critical priorities, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but can rather be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives.
(21)  Given the urgent need to enable crucial investment in defence in the context of pressing geopolitical challenges, this Regulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union .
(22)  Regulations (EU) 2021/694, (EU) 2021/695, (EU) 2021/697, (EU) 2021/1153 ▌ and (EU) 2024/795 should therefore be amended accordingly,

This initiative seeks to bolster the EU's defense capabilities by amending existing regulations to support increased investment in military resources and a coordinated response to emerging threats. A key component of the proposal is the expansion of the Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (STEP) to include critical defense technologies such as air and missile defense, drones, cyber capabilities, and artificial intelligence.

To achieve these objectives, the proposal suggests modifications to several EU programs, including the European Defence Fund (EDF), the Digital Europe Programme (DEP), and Horizon Europe. These changes are designed to pool funding, allow resource transfers from cohesion policy funds to the EDF, and support dual-use technologies that serve both civilian and military purposes. Additionally, the proposal aims to extend the Supporting Ammunition Production (ASAP) regulation and utilize unused funds from Horizon 2020 for new projects, with the goal of strengthening the EU's defense industry by ensuring long-term investment in new production capacities and enhancing the Union's technological and industrial base in defense.

The proposal also emphasizes the importance of skills development in critical defense technologies through the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+) and advocates for a coordinated EU-level approach to ensure seamless mobility for military personnel and equipment. It suggests adapting the timeframe in the Financial Regulation to allow for more flexibility in decision-making.

The threat of ounterfeiting is still substantial. Even though the average number of annually detected counterfeit euro banknotes remains under control, continued vigilance is needed, as demonstrated by the increasing availability of high quality counterfeit euro's and security features on the internet/darknet, the emergence of altered design banknotes, and the existence of counterfeiting hotspots, e.g. in Türkiye and China. Furthermore, euro cash continues to be used widely in the EU alongside electronic means of payment, therefore necessitating ongoing protection against counterfeiting of the single currency. Counterfeits harm citizens and businesses that are not reimbursed for counterfeits even if received in good faith. More generally, it impacts the legal tender status of and trust of citizens and businesses in genuine euro notes and coins.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions  Since the introduction of the euro as a single currency, there is the need to protect the euro against counterfeiting at EU level and to have a specific programme dedicated for this purpose. The current ''Pericles IV'' programme is specifically dedicated to the protection of euro banknotes and coins against counterfeiting, and was established by Regulation (EU)  2021/840 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2021 1 .  Pericles IV’s distinct transnational and multi-disciplinary 2 approach and focus on capacity-building to protect the euro makes it unique among EU-level programmes. As assessed continuously in the programme’s annual reports, it is clearly complementar y to the Technical Assistance and Information Exchange (TAIEX) instrument, that is most often used in support of accession negotiations, and the Internal Security Fund - Police 3 , which covers the prevention and combating of crime in general. Following the inclusion of counterfeiting of currencies as one of the priorities in the Operational Action Plan of EMPACT 4 , the Commission is closely coordinating with the EMPACT driver in order to maximise the complementarity between the two sources of financing. G iven its specialisation and interdisciplinarity, the Pericles programme take s the initiative with regard to training and capacity building, while EMPACT focus es its activities on law enforcement operational support actions .  This legislative proposal concerns the initiative to continue the Pericles programme beyond 2027.  • Consistency with other Union policies  The prevention and combatting of counterfeiting and counterfeiting-related fraud helps to preserve the integrity of the euro, thus strengthening the trust of citizens and business in the genuineness of the euro and therefore contributing to ensuring the effective functioning of the euro, safeguarding fiscal and financial stability in the EU and fostering the international use of the Union’s single currency for trade, financial services and investment.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  Union's legislation concerning the protection of the euro against counterfeiting falls within the scope of Article 133 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). This provision provides that the European Parliament and the Council, acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure shall, after consultation of the European Central Bank, lay down the measures necessary for the use of the euro as the single currency. As with the previous editions of the programme, the application of the Pericles V programme will be extended to the Member States whose currency is not the euro, through a proposal for a parallel Council Regulation based on Article 352 TFEU.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  In accordance with Article 5(3) TEU, the principle of subsidiarity does not apply in areas which fall within the Union’s exclusive competence. In accordance with Article 3(1)(c) TFEU, the EU has an exclusive competence to lay down the measures necessary for the use of the euro as the single currency for the Member States whose currency is the euro. In this area, action by the euro area Member States is not possible and the principle of subsidiarity thus does not apply.  • Proportionality  The proposed Regulation is necessary, suitable and appropriate for achieving the desired end. It proposes to efficiently strengthen cooperation among the Member States and between the Commission and the Member States, without restricting Member States’ capability to protect the euro against counterfeiting. Action at Union level is justified as it clearly assists Member States in collectively protecting the euro and encourages the use of common Union structures to increase cooperation and information exchange between competent authorities.  • Choice of the instrument  The proposed instrument is a Regulation, in continuity with Regulation (EU) 2021/840 establishing the Pericles IV programme. The Regulation has proven to provide the legal certainty required for an effective protection of the euro against counterfeiting which could not have been achieved by means of other legal instruments.  The application of the Pericles programme will be extended to the Member States whose currency is not the euro, through a proposal for a parallel Council Regulation in continuity with Council Regulation (EU) 2021/1696.  3. RESULTS OF RETROSPECTIVE EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Retrospective evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  An interim evaluation of the Pericles IV programme was conducted in 2024, in accordance with Article 13 of Regulation (EU) 2021/840. The evaluation concludes that the Pericles IV Programme is delivering on its objective of contributing to the prevention and combating of euro counterfeiting, thereby preserving the integrity of euro banknotes and coins.  The Programme has generally proven effective in improving information exchange, technical skills, institutional frameworks and operational capabilities in combating euro counterfeiting, in both EU Member States and in third countries. It has successfully facilitated networking and collaborative investigations, leading to significant achievements such as investigations resulting in euro counterfeit seizures and dismantled criminal organisations.  By providing technical trainings, seminars, staff exchanges, and studies, the Programme has supported measures undertaken by Member States, especially where national funding is limited. The Pericles IV Programme has therefore ensured an efficient use of resources thus far in achieving the Programme’s outputs, results, and impacts. While management costs are comparatively high in relative terms compared to similar programmes, this is mainly due to the limited overall budget of the Programme. Their overall share is also declining due to digitalisation, indicating overall efficiency gains. The close involvement of the Commission services in the coordination and implementation of actions, for example by chairing the Euro Counterfeiting Expert Group’s (ECEG) meetings, ensures Member State buy-in and effective monitoring. The Pericles IV generation of the Programme undergoes interim and ex-post evaluations, although given its small size and the high degree of continuity over multiple programming periods, the question of the proportionality of two evaluation requirements per funding cycle relative to the overall budget led to the suggestion for the next generation of the programme to replace one of the two evaluations with an implementation report.  Additionally, the Programme is found to be complementary and coherent relative to initiatives undertaken by other Union institutions, such as the ECB and Europol. As Member State initiatives are limited in scope, the Programme fills this gap by offering multinational and multidisciplinary actions that provide expertise and foster relationship-building among Member States and with third countries. Indeed, the Programme offers significant EU added value by establishing and enhancing relationships and cooperation among Member States, third countries, Union institutions, and international organisations that are beyond the reach of individual national authorities.  The Pericles IV programme also continues to be highly relevant and has adapted to evolving threats. Continuous attention is needed to counter emerging counterfeiting threats and to ensure that the number of euro counterfeits detected remains under control and at low levels: as long as cash is used, the risk posed by counterfeits persists. Current threats which the future programme will need to address include the distribution of counterfeits and high quality components on the internet/darknet, as well as countering ‘movie money’ and ‘prop copy’ products. It also includes potential threats relating to the future digital euro and the impact of Artificial Intelligence on counterfeit currency production and identification. Finally, the evaluation pointed out that the Programme works to ensure the sustainability over time of its outputs and future progress towards its objectives by the transfer of knowledge through regular follow-up actions and ongoing support from the Programme. Stakeholders point to evolving threats and a degree of staff turnover within competent national authorities, and emphasise the need for repeated training every 2-3 years, which attests to the importance of continuing the programme with a similar scope.  • Stakeholder consultations  The proposals for EU programmes under the next multiannual financial framework were preceded by seven public consultations 5 , most notably on EU funding for the single market, and cooperation between national authorities; EU funding for competitiveness; or implementing EU funding with Member States and regions. The consultations targeted a wide range of stakeholders, including citizens, businesses, SMEs, public authorities, recipients of EU funding, civil society organisations, academia, and international stakeholders.  These consultations corroborate the need for streamlined investments in EU competitiveness and the single market at EU level, including through cooperation between national administrations. They show a pronounced agreement among key stakeholders that the single market is strengthened through the optimisation of technical and administrative capacities for Member States; that national authorities, citizens, consumers, and businesses are empowered by resolving knowledge and data gaps; or that addressing transnational challenges and facilitating cross-border cooperation are areas with a clear EU added value.  • Impact assessment  In line with the requirements set out by the EU Financial Regulation 6 and the better regulation guidelines 7 , programmes which provide continuity as regards content and structure or have a relatively small budget, do not require an impact assessment but rather an ex-ante evaluation in the form of a Staff Working Document. The ex-ante evaluation SWD (SWD(…) accompanying this proposal fulfils the Better Regulation requirements. It assesses that the continuation of the Pericles programme would ensure its continued effectiveness in protecting the euro against counterfeiting and counterfeiting-related fraud , notably by ensuring targeted Commission direct actions complementing Member States' actions, and would sustain the long-term effects of the programme as confirmed by its interim evaluation. The high-level of EU added value of the programme is derived from its unique focus, reflected in its legal basis in Article 133 of TFEU, which along with its transnationality and multi-disciplinarity makes it stand out in relation to other EU programmes and national modes of action. Furthermore, with the Commission in charge of both the direct management of the programme and the designing and implementation of EU policy and legislation for the protection of the euro, it guarantees the effective achievement of the objectives of the programme, since it links legislation and policy with the implementation of the programme.  The continuation of the current programme with an increased envelope would ensure its continued effectiveness, also by ensuring targeted Commission direct actions complementing Member States' actions, and would sustain the long-term effects of the programme as confirmed by its interim evaluation. The increased budget would likely result in an increased number of implemented actions and number of action participants compared to the Pericles IV programme period. It would thus assure the fulfilment of the objectives of the Programme by protecting the euro against counterfeiting and counterfeiting related fraud, ensuring an up-to-date framework to detect euro counterfeiting, adapting for upcoming and evolving threats, establishing and sustaining an effective and well-trained anti-counterfeiting network of experts.  • Simplification  The financial implementation of Pericles will be further simplified by an increased use of simplified cost options for grants which would reduce the administrative burden for the applicants to the programme.  • Fundamental rights  The proposal is in line and respects the Union values enshrined in Article 2 of the Treaty on the European Union and the fundamental rights enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the Charter), where the objectives of the proposed initiative are linked to the promotion of fundamental rights and the application of the Charter. For instance, the proposal promotes the freedom to conduct a business by guaranteeing the safe use of the Union’s single currency as a payment method.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  The European Commission proposes to allocate an indicative financial envelope of EUR 7 000 000 (in current prices) t o the programme for 2028-20 34 8 . The detailed estimated financial impact of this proposal is presented in the legislative financial and digital statement enclosed with this proposal .  2025/0258 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  establishing the exchange, assistance and training programme for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting for the period 2028-2034 (the 'Pericles V' programme) and repealing Regulation (EU) 2021/840  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 133 thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank 9 ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure  Whereas:  (1) The Union and the Member States have set themselves the objective of laying down the measures necessary for the use of the euro as a single currency. Those measures include protecting the euro against counterfeiting and counterfeiting-related fraud, thus strengthening the trust of citizens and business in the genuineness of the euro and therefore contributing to ensuring the effective functioning of the eur o, safeguarding fiscal and financial stability in the Union and foste ring the international use of the euro for trade , financial services and investment .  (2) Council Regulation (EC) No 1338/2001 10 provides for exchanges of information, cooperation and mutual assistance, thereby establishing a harmonised framework for the protection of the euro. The effects of that Regulation were extended by Council Regulation (EC) No 1339/2001 11 to those Member States which have not adopted the euro as their single currency, so as to provide an equivalent level of protection for the euro throughout the Union.  (3) Past support for such actions, through Council Decisions 2001/923/EC 12 and 2001/924/EC 13 , which established the first Pericles programme and were subsequently amended and extended by Council Decisions 2006/75/EC, 2006/76/EC, 2006/849/EC, 2006/850/EC, and Regulations (EU) No 331/2014 14 and (EU) 2021/840 of the European Parliament and of the Council 15 , have enhanced the actions of the Union and the Member States in the field of the protection of the euro against counterfeiting. Through these different acts, the Pericles programme has successfully contributed to ensuring  the protection of the euro against counterfeiting.  (4) In that respect, i n its Communication on the results of the interim evaluation of the Pericles IV programme 16 , the Commission conclude d that the current implementing structure of Pericles IV programme is generally effective, efficient, and sustainable and remains relevant in adapting to evolving threats. The Pericles IV p rogramme addresses a critical gap in many Member States, where resources for organising international and multidisciplinary training on euro counterfeiting are often limited. By providing targeted support, the programme strengthens the Union ’s capacity to combat euro counterfeiting and supports the development of new relationships, networks and transnational cooperation efforts. Therefore, the Pericles programme should be continued beyond 2028.  (5) The protection of the European single currency as a public good has a clear transnational dimension, and therefore euro protection goes beyond the interest and the responsibility of individual Member States. Considering the cross-border circulation of the euro and the deep involvement of international organised crime in euro counterfeiting, national protection frameworks should be complemented by Union initiative to ensure homogeneous national and international cooperation, and to face possible emerging transnational risks. Therefore by establishing the exchange, assistance and training programme for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting, this Regulation is necessary, suitable and appropriate for achieving the objectives of the Programme. The Programme should efficiently strengthen cooperation among the Member States and between the Commission and the Member States, without restricting Member States’ capability to protect the euro against counterfeiting. Action at Union level is justified as it clearly assists Member States in collectively protecting the euro and encourages the use of common Union structures to increase cooperation and information exchange between competent authorities.  (6) This Regulation lays down a n indicative financial envelope for the exchange, assistance and training programme for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting (the ‘Pericles V’ programme). For the purpose of this Regulation, current prices are calculated by applying a fixed 2% deflator.  (7) In a rapidly changing economic, social and geopolitical environment, recent experience has shown the need for a more flexible multiannual financial framework and Union spending programmes. To that effect, and in line with the objectives of this Regulation, the funding should duly consider the evolving policy needs and Union’s priorities as identified in relevant documents published by the Commission, in Council conclusions and European Parliament resolutions while ensuring sufficient predictability for the budget implementation.  (8) Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 of the European Parliament and of the Council 17 applies to th e ‘Pericles V’ programme . It lays down the rules on the establishment and the implementation of the general budget of the Union , including the rules on grants, prizes, non-financial donations, procurement, indirect management , financial assistance, financial instruments and budgetary guarantees.  (9) In accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 , Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council 18 , Council Regulation ( EC, Euratom) No 2988/95 19 , Council Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 20 and Council Regulation (EU) 2017/1939 21 , the financial interests of the Union are to be protected through proportionate measures, including the prevention, detection, correction and investigation of irregularities and fraud, the recovery of funds lost, wrongly paid or incorrectly used and, where appropriate, the imposition of administrative sanctions. In particular, in accordance with Regulation s (Euratom) No 883/2013 and (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) may carry out investigations, including on-the-spot checks and inspections, with a view to establishing whether there has been fraud, corruption or any other illegal activity affecting the financial interests of the Union. In accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017/1939, the European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO) may investigate and prosecute fraud , corruption and other criminal offences affecting the financial interests of the Union as provided for in Directive (EU) 2017/1371 of the European Parliament and of the Council 22 . In accordance with  Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509, any person or entity receiving Union funds is to fully cooperate in the protection of the Union’s financial interests, to grant the necessary rights and access to the Commission, OLAF, the EPPO and the European Court of Auditors and to ensure that any third parties involved in the implementation of Union funds grant equivalent rights.  (10) The Programme is to be implemented in accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) 202X/XXXX which establishes the rules for the expenditure tracking and the performance framework for the budget, including rules for ensuring a uniform application of the principles of ‘do no significant harm’ and gender equality referred to in Article 33(2), points (d) and (f), of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 respectively, rules for monitoring and reporting on the performance of Union programmes and activities, rules for establishing a Union funding portal, rules for the evaluation of the programmes, as well as other horizontal provisions applicable to all Union programmes such as those on information, communication and visibility.  (11) Pursuant to Article 85(1) of Council Decision (EU) 2021/1764 23 , persons and entities established in overseas countries and territories are eligible for funding under the Programme and subject to possible arrangements applicable to the Member State to which the relevant overseas country or territory is linked .  (12) Actions eligible for funding, with the aim of promoting exchanges of information and staff, technical and scientific assistance and specialised training, help significantly to protect the Union’s single currency against counterfeiting and counterfeiting-related fraud and therefore to attain a high and equivalent level of protection across the Union, whilst demonstrating the Union’s ability to tackle serious organised crime. In order for the P rogramme to be future-proof, there is a need to maintain the balance between the different types of actions eligible for funding, and the need to maintain its focus on current and emerging threats, including altered-design banknotes and the distribution of counterfeits through the internet. Eligible actions should also cover potential future developments, such as potential threats to the future digital euro, and potential threats posed by and investigational opportunities offered by a rtificial i ntelligence. The purchase of equipment to be used by specialised anti-counterfeiting authorities of third countries for protecting the euro against counterfeiting is also vital to provide for an adequate protection of the euro in third countries, but the purchase of equipment should also be accompanied by the training necessary for its use. Therefore, for this type of action, the purchase of equipment should not be the sole component of the action.  (13) To take into account the transnational and multidisciplinary aspects of the fight against counterfeiting, a balance between the different target groups and participants in the P rogramme’s actions is necessary. Therefore, all actions should be transnational and multidisciplinary in nature, and alongside traditional stakeholders such as law enforcement and national central banks, it is also beneficial to get the judiciary, customs and parcel and delivery services more involved in programme actions as participants ,  (14) The Programme replaces the programme established by Regulation (EU) 2021/840 for 2021 to 2027 . Regulation (EU) 2021/840 should therefore be repealed.  (15) To ensure a smooth transition without interruption between the Pericles IV programme and the Pericles V programme it is appropriate to align the duration of the Pericles V programme with the period of application[reference to the post 2027 MFF Regulation] Regulation (EU, Euratom) …/ 20 xx [?] ]. Therefore, the Pericles V programme should apply from 1 January 2028,  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Article [1]  Subject matter  This Regulation establishes the exchange, assistance and training programme for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting (the ‘Pericles V’ programme) (the ‘Programme’) and lays down the objectives of the Programme, its budget for the period 2028-2034, the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding.  Article [2]  Programme objectives  1. The general objective of the Programme is to prevent and combat counterfeiting and counterfeiting-related fraud and preserve the integrity of the euro, thus strengthening the trust of citizens and business in the genuineness of the euro and therefore contributing to ensuring the effective functioning of the euro, safeguarding fiscal and financial stability in the Union and fostering the international use of the euro for trade, financial services and investment.  2. The Programme has the specific objective to protect the euro against counterfeiting and counterfeiting-related fraud, taking also into account potential future developments, such as potential threats to the future digital euro, and potential threats posed by and investigational opportunities offered by artificial intelligence. It does so by supporting and supplementing the measures undertaken by Member States and assisting the competent national and Union authorities in their efforts to develop among themselves and with the Commission a close and regular cooperation and an exchange of best practice, where appropriate including third countries and international organisations.  Article [3]  Budget  1. The indicative financial envelope for the implementation of the Programme for the period 2028- 2034 is set at EUR 7 000 000 in current prices.  2. Appropriations may be entered in the Union budget beyond 2034 to cover the expenses necessary and to enable the management of actions not completed by the end of the Programme.  3. The financial envelope referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article and the amounts of additional resources referred to in Article 4 may also be used for technical and administrative assistance for the implementation of the Programme, such as preparatory, monitoring, control, audit and evaluation activities, corporate information technology systems and platforms, information, visibility and communication activities, including corporate communication on the political priorities of the Union, and all other technical and administrative assistance or staff-related expenses incurred by the Commission for the management of the Programme.  Article [4]  Additional resources  1. Member States, Union institutions, bodies and agencies, third countries, international organisations, international financial institutions, or other third parties, may make additional financial or non-financial contributions to the Programme. Additional financial contributions shall constitute external assigned revenue within the meaning of Article 21(2), points (a), (d), or (e), or Article 21(5) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509.  2. Resources allocated to Member States under shared management may, at their request, be made available to the Programme. The Commission shall implement those resources directly or indirectly in accordance with Article 62(1), point (a) or (c), of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509. They shall be additional to the amount referred to in Article 3(1) of this Regulation. Those resources shall be used for the benefit of the Member State concerned. Where the Commission has not entered into a legal commitment under direct or indirect management for additional amounts thus made available to the Programme, the corresponding uncommitted amounts may, at the request of the Member State concerned, be transferred back to one or more respective source programmes or their successors.  Article [5]  Alternative, combined and cumulative funding  1. The Programme shall be implemented in synergy with other Union programmes. An action that has received a Union contribution from another programme may also receive a contribution under the Programme. The rules of the relevant Union programme shall apply to the corresponding contribution or a single set of rules may be applied to all contributions and a single legal commitment may be concluded. If the Union contribution is based on eligible costs, the cumulative support from the Union budget shall not exceed the total eligible costs of the action and may be calculated on a pro-rata basis in accordance with the documents setting out the conditions for support.  2. Award procedures under the Programme may be jointly conducted under direct or indirect management with Member States, Union institutions, bodies and agencies, third countries, international organisations, international financial institutions, or other third parties (‘partners to the joint award procedure’), provided the protection of the financial interests of the Union is ensured. Such procedures shall be subject to a single set of rules and lead to the conclusion of single legal commitments. For that purpose, the partners to the joint award procedure may make resources available to the Programme in accordance with Article [5] of this Regulation, or the partners may be entrusted with the implementation of the award procedure, where applicable in accordance with Article 62(1), point (c), of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024 /2509. In joint award procedures , representatives of the partners to the joint award procedure may also be members of the evaluation committee referred to in Article 153(3) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024 /2509.  Article [6]  Third countries associated to the Programme  1.

FRAMEWORK OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE  1.1. Title of the proposal/initiative  Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the Pericles V programme for the period 2028-2034.  1.2. Policy area(s) concerned  Protection of the euro against counterfeiting.  1.3. Objective(s)  1.3.1. General objective(s)  The general objective of the Programme is to prevent and combat counterfeiting and counterfeiting-related fraud and preserve the integrity of the euro, thus strengthening the trust of citizens and business in the genuineness of the euro and therefore contributing to ensuring the effective functioning of the euro, safeguarding fiscal and financial stability in the Union and fostering the international use of the euro for trade, financial services and investment.  1.3.2. Specific objective(s)  The Programme has the following specific objective: to protect the euro against counterfeiting and counterfeiting-related fraud, taking also into account potential future developments, such as potential threats to the future digital euro, and potential threats posed by and investigational opportunities offered by Artificial Intelligence. It does so by supporting and supplementing the measures undertaken by Member States and assisting the competent national and Union authorities in their efforts to develop among themselves and with the Commission a close and regular cooperation and an exchange of best practice, where appropriate including third countries and international organisations.  1.3.3. Expected result(s) and impact  The Pericles programme will help the beneficiaries – the competent authorities of Member States – in their work protecting the euro against counterfeiting and counterfeiting-related fraud through training, exchange of best practice and awareness raising. Target groups for the action of the programme will be all staff in public and private sector related to the protection of the euro.  1.3.4. Indicators of performance  This initiative will be monitored through the performance framework for the post-2027 budget, which is examined in a separate proposal. The performance framework provides for an implementation report during the implementation phase of the programme, as well as a retrospective evaluation to be carried out in accordance with Article 34(3) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509. The evaluation shall be conducted in accordance with the Commission's Better Regulation Guidelines and will be based on indicators relevant to the objectives of the programme  The output and result indicators for the purpose of monitoring progress and achievements of this programme will correspond to the common indicators provided under Regulation xxx [Horizontal Performance Regulation]  1.4. The proposal/initiative relates to:   a new action   a new action following a pilot project / preparatory action 24   the extension of an existing action   a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action  1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative  1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative  The euro is, as the single currency of the Union, a core European interest, the integrity of which needs to be protected in all its dimensions. The threat of counterfeiting is  still substantial. Even though the average number of annually detected counterfeit euro banknotes remains under control, continued vigilance is needed, as demonstrated by the increasing availability of high quality counterfeit euro's and security features on the internet/darknet, the emergence of altered design banknotes, and the existence of counterfeiting hotspots within and outside the EU.. Furthermore, euro cash continues to be used widely in the EU alongside electronic means of payment, therefore necessitating ongoing protection against counterfeiting of the single currency. Counterfeits harm citizens and businesses that are not reimbursed for counterfeits even if received in good faith. More generally, it impacts the legal tender status of and trust of citizens and businesses in genuine euro notes and coins.  As the protection of the euro against counterfeiting requires continous attention, the implementation of the initiative will be rolled out on a continuous basis, through dedicated grants and procured actions.  1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, great er effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this section 'added value of EU involvement' is the value resulting from EU action, that is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.  The protection of the European single currency as a public good has a clear transnational dimension, and therefore euro protection goes beyond the interest and the responsibility of individual EU Member States. Considering the cross-border circulation of the euro and the deep involvement of international organised crime in euro counterfeiting (production and distribution), national protection frameworks need to be complemented by an EU initiative to ensure homogeneous national and international cooperation, and to face possible emerging transnational risks.  . By providing targeted support, the Programme strengthens the EU’s capacity to combat euro counterfeiting. An absence of the Programme would impact ongoing initiatives and hinder the development of new relationships and networks, impeding transnational cooperation efforts.  Expected generated EU added value  The Programme offers significant EU added value by establishing and enhancing relationships and cooperation among Member States, third countries, Union institutions, and international organisations that are beyond the reach of individual national authorities, such as establishing a coordinated relationship with the Chinese authorities to counter threats such as the distribution of counterfeit euro holograms, and encouraging a common EU strategy to counter the threats posed by altered design banknotes.  By providing targeted support, the Programme strengthens the EU’s capacity to combat euro counterfeiting. An absence of the Programme would impact ongoing initiatives and hinder the development of new relationships and networks, impeding transnational cooperation efforts.  1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past  A mid-term evaluation of the Pericles IV programme was conducted in 2024, in accordance with Article 13 of Regulation (EU) No 2021/840. The evaluation concludes that the Pericles IV Programme is delivering on its objective of contributing to the prevention and combating of euro counterfeiting, thereby preserving the integrity of euro banknotes and coins.  The Programme has generally proven effective in improving information exchange, technical skills, institutional frameworks and operational capabilities in combating euro counterfeiting, in both EU Member States and in third countries. It has successfully facilitated networking and collaborative investigations, leading to significant achievements such as investigations resulting in euro counterfeit seizures and dismantled criminal organisations.  According to the mid-term evaluation of the Pericles IV programme, the programme addresses a critical gap in many Member States, where resources for organising international and multidisciplinary trainings on euro counterfeiting are often limited. By providing technical trainings, seminars, staff exchanges, and studies, the Programme has supported measures undertaken by Member States, especially where national funding is limited. The Pericles IV Programme has therefore ensured an efficient use of resources thus far in achieving the Programme’s outputs, results, and impacts. While management costs are comparatively high in relative terms compared to similar programmes, this is mainly due to the limited overall budget of the Programme. Their overall share is also declining due to digitalisation, indicating overall efficiency gains. The close involvement of the Commission services in the coordination and implementation of actions, for example by chairing the Euro Counterfeiting Expert Group’s (ECEG) meetings, ensures Member State buy-in and effective monitoring. The Pericles IV generation of the Programme undergoes mid-term and ex-post evaluations, although given its small size and the high degree of continuity over multiple programming periods, the question of the proportionality of two evaluation requirements per funding cycle relative to the overall budget led to the suggestion for the next generation of the programme to replace one of the two evaluations with an implementation report.  Additionally, the Programme is found to be complementary and coherent relative to initiatives undertaken by other Union institutions, such as the ECB and Europol. As Member State initiatives are limited in scope, the Programme fills this gap by offering multinational and multidisciplinary actions that provide expertise and foster relationship-building among Member States and with third countries.  The Pericles IV programme also continues to be highly relevant and has adapted to evolving threats. . Continuous attention is needed to counter emerging counterfeiting threats and to ensure that the number of euro counterfeits detected remains under control and at low levels: as long as cash is used, the risk posed by counterfeits persists. Current threats which the future programme will need to address include the distribution of counterfeits and high quality components on the internet/darknet, as well as countering ‘movie money’ and ‘prop copy’ products. It also includes potential threats relating to the future digital euro and the impact of Artificial Intelligence on counterfeit currency production and identification. Finally, the evaluation pointed out that the Programme works to ensure the sustainability over time of its outputs and future progress towards its objectives by the transfer of knowledge through regular follow-up actions and ongoing support from the Programme. Stakeholders point to evolving threats and a degree of staff turnover within competent national authorities, and emphasise the need for repeated training every 2-3 years, which attests to the importance of continuing the programme with a similar scope.  1.5.4. Compatibility with the multiannual financial framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments  The initiative is part of the 2028-2034 multiannual financial framework proposal.  The Programme offers significant EU added value by establishing and enhancing relationships and cooperation among Member States, third countries, Union institutions, and international organisations that are beyond the reach of individual national authorities.  Possible synergies could be found with the Single Market Programme which will pool measures supported by the EU budget to break down cross-border and cross-country barriers and foster cooperation between national administrations, which Pericles will also contribute to, as well as to the efficient functioning of the single market by guaranteeing the safety of the single currency. Synergies with the European Competitiveness Fund can also found in that the Pericles V programme will also seek to contribute to strategic autonomy and the protection of critical infrastructure by ensuring the safe use of the euro as the single currency and a payment method.  1.5.5.

Comments  Not applicable  2. MANAGEMENT MEASURES  2.1. Monitoring and reporting rules  The monitoring and reporting rules for this programme will follow the requirements laid down in Regulation xxx [Horizontal Performance Regulation]  2.2. Management and control system(s)  2.2.1. Justification of the budget implementation method(s), the funding implementation mechanism(s), the payment modalities and the control strategy proposed  Budget implementation method:  The Programme shall be implemented through direct management by the Commission. This ensures that the Commission is in charge of both the direct management of the Programme and the designing and implementation of EU policy and legislation for the protection of the euro, covering prevention, enforcement and cooperation, allowing an optimal degree of synergy. This guarantees the effective achievement of the objectives of the Programme, since it links legislation and policy with the implementation of the Programme. Participation of the Commission in nearly every action supports preparation and presentation of the EU legislative and policy dimensions.  Funding implementation mechanism:  Financial support under the Programme for eligible actions shall take the form of either:  (a) grants (‘Competent National Authority-implemented actions’), or  (b) public procurement (‘direct actions’).  The Commission makes use of procurement ('direct actions') with an aim to complement the grant actions and therefore meet the highest number of emerging threats and priorities.  The work programme will include all mandatory elements as per Article 110 of the Financial Regulation, including the budgetary allocation.  Payment modalities:  The Commission makes the following payments to the beneficiary:  - one pre-financing payment;  - one payment of the balance, on the basis of the request for payment of the balance.  The aim of the pre-financing is to provide the beneficiary with a float. The pre-financing remains the property of the Union until it is cleared against the payment of the balance. The payment of the balance reimburses or covers the remaining part of the eligible costs incurred by the beneficiary for the implementation of the action.  Control strategy:  The control procedures for both sections of the programme (grants & procurements) are in compliance with the Financial Regulation.  Ex-ante verifications (commitment & payments)  The Commission's choice of a financial circuit is for a partially decentralised model, with financial initiation and verification placed in the central finance unit and operational initiation, verification and final authorisation in the operational units. All files will be verified by at least 4 agents (the financial initiating agent and financial verifying agent in the budget unit and the operational initiating agent and verifying agent in the unit responsible for the expenditure) before they are accepted by the Authorising Officer by sub-delegation.  In all the Pericles procurement files, a Commission representative is present on the day of the action in order to supervise the good implementation of the funds (e.g. conferences and trainings).  Grants  - The grant agreement signed by the beneficiaries defines the conditions applying to the financing and activities resorting under the grant, including a chapter on control methods.  - In most of the Pericles grants, a Commission  representative is present on the day of the action in order to contribute to the event (e.g.: speakers, trainers) and checking the good implementation of the action (e.g. conferences and trainings).  Procurement  - Detailed terms of reference are drafted and form the basis of the specific contract. Anti-fraud measures are foreseen in all contracts concluded between the Commission  and the external party.  - The Commission  performs controls of all deliverables and supervises all operations and services carried out by our framework contractor.  The controls established enable the Commission  to have sufficient assurance of the quality and regularity of the expenditure and reduce the risk of non-compliance. The above mentioned controls reduce the potential risks virtually to zero and reach 100% of the beneficiaries. The programme control strategy is deemed efficient to limit the risk of noncompliance and is proportionate with the risk entailed given the small budget involved.  2.2.2. Information concerning the risks identified and the internal control system(s) set up to mitigate them  The level of risk is considered low for the grant agreements, since for 90% of the cases the beneficiaries are public administrations or law enforcement services in the Member States. For the contracts awarded on the basis of a procurement process the risks are narrowed since an important part of the expenditure is legally and financially covered by a framework contract concluded for 1 year with the possibility to extend 3 times.  In line with the Commission requirements, a risk assessment exercise will be performed each year.  An important risk identified in grant files is the lenient interpretation by the beneficiary of the grant conditions regarding eligibility of costs occurred in the implementation of the action. In order to mitigate this risk an FAQ for Applicants is published in the Funding and Tenders Portal.  Reliability of financial reporting: To ensure a true and fair view of the state of affairs, all payments are subject to a verification of their amounts. Horizontal accounting verification and reporting are also performed.  Safeguarding of assets and information: The pre-financing payments which remain to be cleared show as assets on the balance sheet. Safeguarding is achieved through two main means: the financial capacity of the potential beneficiary is assured since all applicants are selected from a closed group of public bodies and throughout the year the operational unit regularly monitors whether deliverables are received on time.  2.2.3. Estimation and justification of the cost-effectiveness of the controls (ratio between the control costs  and the value of the related funds managed), and assessment of the expected levels of risk of error (at payment & at closure)  The overall cost effectiveness of controls on Pericles expenses will be measured by the proportion of overall costs of controls over the payments. It should be considered that although the control costs ratio will be above average the implementation will be sufficiently efficient and cost-effective. The high control costs ratio can be explained by the following:  The responsible unit is also an active business unit whose activities are intertwined with the implementation of the Pericles actions carried out by Members States and competent national authorities. This is accomplished through the discussion and coordination of MS' Experts Group as well as through the attendance in all events/ workshops/ trainings organised by beneficiaries. Preliminary discussions guarantee the high quality of the outputs to be used for the work of the unit. The participation of Commission  staff in all events mainly relates to its activities as a business unit (chairing, delivering presentations, leading workshops, co-drafting conclusions and consequent use of the outputs) and, at the same time, gives the opportunity to monitor and evaluate on the spot the quality of all actions implemented (max. 15% of the time spent on the spot). In the same context, the Commission  often welcomes participants of Pericles staff exchanges on its premises. These tasks account for a significant amount of time for the unit, most of them are policy related.  Pericles has a relatively small budget, whose implementation and controls are not proportional to the relative low grants awarded, in a similar vein, due to its low budget, the programme cannot benefit from economies of scale.  The programme is carried out through one call for proposal, having two deadlines; therefore two award procedures are managed each year. The objective for the management and control system is to maintain the expected levels of risk of error (at payment & at closure) below the materiality threshold of 2% on an annual basis.  2.3. Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities  See recital 9 of the proposal. In accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509, Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council , Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2988/95 , Council Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96  and Council Regulation (EU) 2017/1939 , the financial interests of the Union are to be protected through proportionate measures, including the prevention, detection, correction and investigation of irregularities and fraud, the recovery of funds lost, wrongly paid or incorrectly used and, where appropriate, the imposition of administrative sanctions. In particular, in accordance with Regulations (Euratom) No 883/2013 and (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) may carry out investigations, including on-the-spot checks and inspections, with a view to establishing whether there has been fraud, corruption or any other illegal activity affecting the financial interests of the Union. In accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017/1939, the European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO) may investigate and prosecute fraud and other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Union as provided for in Directive (EU) 2017/1371 of the European Parliament and of the Council . In accordance with  Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509, any person or entity receiving Union funds is to fully cooperate in the protection of the Union’s financial interests, to grant the necessary rights and access to the Commission, OLAF, EPPO and the European Court of Auditors and to ensure that any third parties involved in the implementation of Union funds grant equivalent rights.  The Commission maintains a robust Commission Anti-Fraud Strategy (CAFS). DG ECFIN complements this by an anti-fraud and audit strategy that covers the activities falling under its remit, as well as with ex-post controls on DG ECFIN programmes.  3.

Requirements of digital relevance  Table: Row 1 — The current proposal is deemed to have no digital relevance. It does not introduce, modify, or affect the use of digital means, data aspects, or provision of digital-public services. The scope of the proposal is limited to the protection of the euro against counterfeiting and therefore falls outside the application of the digital-by-default principle. The application process for beneficiaries to the programme is managed through the e-grants system, which is a pre-existing digital tool used by most grant programmes to facilitate the application process.  4.2.

Building on the success of its predecessor, ""Pericles IV,"" the programme aims to maintain the euro's integrity by addressing the threat of high-quality counterfeit currency. It focuses on training and capacity-building for authorities, fostering cooperation among EU member states, and coordinating with other security initiatives to bolster anti-counterfeiting efforts.

A key feature of the proposal is its extension to non-euro member states through a parallel Council Regulation, ensuring a unified approach across the EU. The programme includes actions such as the exchange and dissemination of information, technical and operational assistance, and the purchase of equipment for specialized anti-counterfeiting authorities in third countries. These actions are to be implemented through grants, with the stipulation that equipment purchases are not the sole component of the grant agreement.

Eligible actions under the programme require participation from trainers and/or trainees from at least two member states or third countries, and from at least two professional groups. Funding is available to competent national authorities, and in cases where third countries participate, their appointed authorities are also eligible. The programme will be implemented through work programmes, with specific eligibility criteria potentially outlined further in these programmes.

To ensure the integrity and proper implementation of the programme, all files will be verified by at least four agents before acceptance by the Authorising Officer. The financial framework includes appropriations for"
