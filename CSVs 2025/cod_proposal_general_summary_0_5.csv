C ONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  This proposal provides for a date of application as of 1 January 2028 and is presented for a Union of 25 Member States. For Ireland and Denmark, the provisions of Protocols No 21 and No 22 annexed to the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) apply, as illustrated in the section on variable geometry on page 8.  · Reasons and objectives  Article 3 of TEU states that ‘ The Union shall offer its citizens an area of freedom, security and justice ’. Justice is closely linked to Union values, as enshrined in Article 2 TEU. These core values imply the need for independent judiciaries operating within efficient and high-quality justice systems capable of safeguarding fundamental rights and freedoms guaranteed by Union law, in particular by ensuring access to justice for suspects, accused persons, requested persons in European arrest warrant (EAW) proceedings and victims of crime. Judicial independence itself stems from the common constitutional traditions shared by all Member States, the rule of law mentioned in Article 2 TEU, the Member States’ obligation to provide remedies sufficient to ensure effective legal protection in the fields covered by Union law under Article 19 TEU, and from the fundamental right to an effective remedy before a tribunal, as enshrined in Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (‘the Charter’). In addition to being in line with Union values, a well-functioning Union area of justice with effective, efficient and resilient national justice systems is necessary for a flourishing internal market and is also a precondition for economic growth and competitiveness.  In the past years, the EU has combined several instruments to build a Union area of justice based on mutual trust . Several legislative and policy initiatives 1 have been adopted and supported, also thanks to dedicated EU funding.  Since its launch in 2014, the Justice programme has actively supported the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice, by fostering judicial cooperation based on mutual recognition and enforcement of judicial decisions. The Programme has also promoted Member States’ adherence to the rule of law and fundamental rights and supported the proper functioning of independent judicial systems. This has led to tangible progress across the EU as, for instance, national justice systems have become more effective, with legal practitioners now better informed and equipped to apply the relevant EU acquis , e.g. on the use of cross-border judicial cooperation procedures and mechanisms. At the same time, the practical protection and promotion of the rights of children and other vulnerable groups (such as persons with disabilities) involved in judicial proceedings continues to improve.  Significant progress has been made 2 , but achieving an effective, efficient, accessible, resilient and digitalised Union area of justice, based on the rule of law, remains an ongoing challenge. This calls for continued coordinated action by the EU and its Member States. In the Political Guidelines for the European Commission 2024-2029, President von der Leyen emphasised that the respect for the rule of law should remain ‘ a must for EU funds ’ 3 . This underscores the critical role EU funding plays in addressing persistent challenges.  In fact, despite the EU commitment, the protection and promotion of fundamental rights is an ongoing challenge 4 . These rights – such as the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial, as well as the protection of whistleblowers and their right to freedom of expression, associated procedural safeguards for suspects and accused persons as well as requested persons in EAW proceedings , and victims’ rights – are central to justice and the rule of law. Their effective implementation is essential to build trust in the justice system and ensure that everyone, including the most vulnerable, can effectively exercise their rights in the EU as an area of justice. However, as the 2021 annual report on the application of the Charter also show s , fragmented application of U nion law and legal protection gaps 5 reflect ongoing challenges in this area 6 .  In addition, progress on digitalisation across the EU is uneven. The EU’s growth and competitiveness increasingly rely on digitalisation, including in the justice sector. Digital tools and artificial intelligence (AI) can help public administrations, including courts, deliver faster, more accessible and cost-effective services. At the same time, the use of qualified trust services, such as electronic signatures and seals, brings benefits in terms of convenience and legal certainty in the context of cross-border transactions and is becoming increasingly relevant for transparent and trustable justice systems. The upcoming rollout of the EU Digital Identity framework and the forthcoming European Business Wallets are also expected to further facilitate digitalisation and build trust. Efficient and transparent justice systems enhance legal certainty, attract investment and strengthen cross-border cooperation in civil and criminal matters. Digitalisation reduces burdens on justice professionals, improves access to judicial files and allows citizens and businesses to engage with courts remotely. This increases transparency, saves costs and supports economic productivity. Moreover, digital justice systems are more resilient during crises, ensuring continuity and reinforcing public trust.  The rapidly changing economic, social and geopolitical environment creates uncertainties and challenges, including Russia’s full-scale war against Ukraine. Among the challenges which affect, more specifically, the Union area of justice, are the increasing threats to the rule of law, several forms of serious crime and obstacles to access to justice and judicial cooperation. Respect for the rule of law is a key determinant of a predictable business environment that drives investment and innovation, and an essential consideration for companies operating across borders. Respect for the rule of law ensures the proper functioning and resilience of the internal market, of the cooperation in the justice area based on mutual trust and recognition and is an essential precondition for compliance with the principles of sound financial management of the Union budget. Respect for the rule of law is necessary for the effective, uniform and transparent application of Union law and for equal access to justice. Facilitating cooperation in relation to forms of serious crime, such as corruption, terrorism and environmental crime is essential to maintain the rule of law and trust in those who govern public institutions.  Other challenges include persist ent obstacles to judicial cooperation and access to justice. Effective access to justice, including through digital means, is a prerequisite for economic growth . If there is no effective access to justice, both citizens and business development, especially that of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) , are affected . Weak justice systems, characteri s ed by inefficiency or high costs, deter business activities, thereby hindering economic growth 7 . One of t he main obstacles is the fact that communication in cross-border judicial proceedings is very often still paper-based, which leads to unnecessary delays and costs. One of the reasons is the different speed s of digitalisation of national justice systems and the absence of sufficient interoperability between Member States’ national IT systems , and similarly, between national systems and EU Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) agencies and bodies. Besides this aspect, delays and inefficiencies in cross-border judicial cooperation procedures remain evident. Access to justice – i.e. the ability of everyone to seek and obtain a just resolution of legal problems through a range of legal and justice services, in a manner that complies with fundamental rights, including access to reliable legal information and effective enjoyment of procedural safeguards – is still problematic, above all in cross-border contexts. This affects individuals, such as victims and persons suspected or accused of crime, and businesses. Moreover, the existing tools for collecting comparative information about the quality, independence and efficiency of Member States’ justice systems are still insufficient . All these factors can undermine Member States’ trust in each other ’ s justice systems and may therefore hinder the proper functioning of the EU area of freedom, security and justice.  Lastly , the level of knowledge, skills and awareness of the EU acquis and EU digital tools among practitioners in the justice field is often in sufficient. Despite the progress made 8 , the level of participation in training still differs considerably between Member States and among justice professions. This has a negative impact on the development of a common European judicial culture , since well-trained practitioners play a key role in ensuring that the EU acquis is implemented correctly and consistently across the EU. J ustice professionals also lack the necessary digitals skills and are not well equipped to use digital tools and infrastructure. Training on U nion law is also particularly important in view of the following factors: (i) the deterioration of the rule of law and attacks on fundamental rights in some Member States ; (ii) the need to prevent and combat forms of serious crime, including corruption ; (iii) the increasing relevance of digitalisation ; and (iv) the fact that there are more and more individuals exercising their right to live and work in another Member State 9 .  The consequences of not addressing these challenges will have serious repercussions, as most of these issues have a marked transnational dimension and cannot be adequately addressed by Member States acting alone. Building an effective Union area of justice has profound implications for the political, social and economic life of the EU. It also has tangible benefits for people’s day-to-day lives and business operations. The 2028-2034 Justice programme will support the further development of a Union area of justice based on the Union’s values, the rule of law, mutual recognition and trust, as well as effective, inclusive, accessible and resilient justice systems, which are a precondition for economic growth and competitiveness. The new Programme will also facilitate access to justice, promote judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters and promote judicial training with a stronger emphasis on the digitalisation of justice. The policy areas covered by this legal proposal are firmly anchored in the EU Treaties, which provide the legal bases for EU action through financial intervention. The Justice programme will continue to sustain open, democratic, pluralist and more equal and inclusive societies under the next Multiannual Financial Framework (2028-2034).  · Consistency with existing policy provisions  In recent years, the Justice programme has supported several legislative and policy initiatives and has directly contributed to delivering on several of the Commission’s priorities 10 . The priorities listed below are and will become even more relevant for the J ustice programme:  1. ‘ Protecting our democracy, upholding our values ’ . T he Justice programme will support judicial cooperation and access to justice by reinforcing the rule of law and fundamental rights as democratic foundation of the EU. The P rogramme’s new enhanced focus on digitalisation will make judicial systems more efficient , by enabling faster access to legal protection. This new focus directly complements efforts to safeguard democracy and fundamental rights, and increase legal certainty, investment protection, procedural fairness and public trust in democratic institutions. T he 2028-2034 Justice programme will support judicial independence and increase the capacity to enforce laws, including relevant rules to protect democracy . I t will enable cross-border judicial cooperation to combat cross-border digital crimes and support the implementation of digital tools that align with broader digital enforcement policies like the Digital Services Act 11 , the AI Act 12 and the European Accessibility Act 13 . It will contribute to the application of the Charter by supporting training of legal professionals on fundamental rights . To this end, synergies will be fostered in particular with the AgoraEU programme 14 .  2. ‘ Supporting people, strengthening our societies and our social model ’ . The Justice programme will contribute to uphold fundamental rights, for instance by promoting judicial training on non-discrimination and on the application of the Charter and create links with social cohesion policies by supporting consistent legal protection across Member States. The P rogramme will also support the implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights 15 by ensuring enforceability through more accessible justice mechanisms. Moreover, digitalised justice systems, set up with due attention to security vulnerabilities and the needs of all affected persons, have the potential to improve access to justice, including by reducing barriers , especially for children and other vulnerable groups such as people with disabilities, Roma and other marginalised communities . In this regard, synergies will be fostered with the Erasmus+ programme 16 and the National and Regional Partnership Plans 17 including, in particular in the framework of the European Social Fund 18 . By improving accessibility and affordability ( e.g. videoconferencing, e-filing), digital justice can better inform interested parties , serve the needs of many individuals and businesses , and reduce inequalities in accessing rights and services , by strengthening social and intergenerational fairness and making legal processes more efficient and inclusive.  3. ‘ Delivering together and preparing our Union for the future ’. The Justice programme will contribute to a more integrated and effective Union, including by creating and connecting digital infrastructure across Member States. Its increased focus on digitalisation will reduce administrative burdens for Member States, bring savings for citizens and businesses, improve cross-border cooperation and support mutual recognition and enforcement of judgments. At the same time, the Programme will support the goal of simplifying EU mechanisms by promoting more interoperability among national justice systems. In this regard, synergies will be fostered with the National and Regional Partnership Plans to ensure progress on the digitalisation of national justice systems at both national and EU level.  · Consistency with other Union policies  1. “ A New Plan for Europe’s Sustainable Prosperity and Competitiveness ” . The d igitalisation of justice contributes to growth and competitiveness by creating more efficient justice systems , with simplified legal procedures and reduced time and costs for cross-border litigation across the EU. This is particularly important for SMEs and start-ups. In this regard, s ynergies will be fostered with the National and Regional Partnership Plans in key areas such as skills , capacity-building and digitalisation. The Programme will complement also the plan to deepen the Single Market (especially in services and digital sectors and on financial services ) by promoting legal interoperability and smoother enforcement of EU rules. By financing activities on consumer and investors policy , company law and contract law and anti-money laundering , the 2028-2034 Single Market and Customs programme will complement the Justice programme and contribute directly to the implementation of EU policy in the field of justice and the creation of a U nion area of justice. Moreover, by reinforcing the rule of law and legal certainty, the Justice programme will strengthen the investment environment , reinforce the actions underpinning the Savings and Investments Union 19 and support the European Competitiveness Fund 20 by creating a stable legal framework for business activity. Lastly , there will also be synergies in the field of research and innovation, specifically concerning the need to deepen the understanding of the use of advanced new technologies, such as AI, in the justice sector and, therefore, synergies will be fostered with the next Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (Horizon Europe) 21 .  2. “ A New Era for European Defence and Security ”: The Justice programme facilitates cross-border judicial cooperation, which is crucial for security and to combat organised crime, terrorism, and cyber threats. The Programme also supports the enforcement of the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) and provides digital infrastructure for lawful access to electronic evidence and case management across borders. Moreover, the Justice programme supports anti-corruption measures at EU level . This complement s the call for reflection on extending the competence of the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) to handle serious cross-border crimes, especially corruption , that impacts Union funds and cannot be handled alone by Member States. In addition, the political guidelines for the European Commission 2024-2029 22 include the ambition to bolster Europol’s capacity to support national law enforcement agencies and its cooperation with other EU agencies and bodies . This ambition is closely aligned with the P rogramme’s increased focus on digitalisation, enabling faster transmission of evidence, real-time coordination and an enhanced use of secure AI/data analytics in legal enforcement within the limits of the applicable legal frameworks . It also aligns with the establishment of the Authority for Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AMLA) , which will help prevent the Union’s financial system from being used of money laundering and terrorist financing . Likewise, the reform of Eurojust will help EU-level coordination of cross-border investigations and prosecutions to become more effective, including thanks to new digital tools. Additionally, the digitalisation of justice will also provide technical resilience, secure infrastructure for legal systems , and frameworks for prosecuting cybercrime, thereby complementing the Preparedness Union 23 and cyber-defence strategies 24 as well as the ‘ ProtectEU – a European Internal Security Strategy ’ 25 . Given the intrinsic connections between security and justice on the ground, there will be synergies with EU funds covering asylum, migration and integration, border management and internal security, for instance to provide adequate training to the judiciary , also in relation to the new rules introduced by the Pact on Migration and Asylum, and ensure effective protection to victims of crime, interoperability with the European Criminal Records Information System (ECRIS) and inter-agency cooperation in the fields of justice and internal security, including via justice-related agencies and bodies such as Eurojust and the EPPO.  3. “ A Global Europe: Leveraging Our Power and Partnerships ”: The P rogramme’s focus on the rule of law, judicial cooperation and access to justice will mirror how they are promoted at global level, including through the implementation of the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 26 . In this respect, synergies will be developed with Global Europe 27 , as the Justice programme will contribute to the EU’s external action by strengthening judicial systems in accession countries in the context of the enlargement process .  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  · Legal basis  This proposal is based on Article 81(1) and (2) and Article 82(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).  Article 81(1) TFEU provides that the Union shall develop judicial cooperation in civil matters having cross-border implications.  Article 81(2) TFEU provides for the adoption of measures aimed at ensuring the mutual recognition and enforcement of judgments; the cross-border service of judicial and extrajudicial documents; effective access to justice and support for the training of the judiciary and judicial staff. Article 82(1) TFEU provides for measures to promote judicial cooperation in criminal matters.  The combination of these Articles allows for a comprehensive approach to support the development of judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters, especially cross-cutting issues affecting both fields.  · Variable geometry  This Regulation is based on legal bases under Title V of Part Three TFEU, concerning the area of freedom, security and justice. As a consequence, the application of the Regulation to Denmark and Ireland is subject to the provisions laid down in Protocol No 21 and Protocol No 22 annexed to the TEU and the TFEU.  In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No 22, Denmark does not take part in the adoption by the Council of measures proposed pursuant to Title V of Part Three TFEU, and such measures are not binding upon or applicable in Denmark.  In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No 21, Ireland does not take part in the adoption by the Council of measures proposed pursuant to Title V of Part Three TFEU, and such measures are not binding on or applicable in Ireland. However, Ireland may choose to take part in the adoption and application of any such proposed measure. In addition, any time after the adoption of such a measure, Ireland may accept the measure, subject to the completion of procedures referred to in Article 4 of Protocol No 21.  · Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  The objectives outlined under the section “reasons and objectives” have a strong transnational dimension and require joint solutions, as well as EU-level governance, coordination and support. Isolated national actions would be less effective and impactful than coordinated EU-level efforts, which foster cooperation, capacity building, mutual learning, and the sharing of resources, expertise and best practice.  Without EU action and funding, the functioning of a Union area of justice would be at risk, negatively affecting many beneficiaries, especially members of the judiciary, civil society organisations (CSOs) working on access to justice, and EU-wide legal networks. EU support helps overcome national barriers, enabling each Member State to act on issues it could not address alone. This ensures no Member State is left behind in tackling cross-border problems.  EU-level action is also key for addressing EU-wide priorities that may not rank highly on national agendas or where targeted support is needed. In some areas, national efforts alone may be insufficient, short-term or misaligned with EU priorities. For example, the EU should continue to support cross-border training on Union law and exchanges for judicial professionals. This is not only a Treaty-based obligation, but also essential for meeting shared transnational challenges, equipping justice professionals with the right skills and reinforcing core Union values.  The EU is uniquely positioned to create cross-border opportunities for justice professionals to connect, develop and contribute to a shared legal culture. It should therefore continue to promote transnational cooperation, awareness raising and networking. Such activities build mutual trust among national justice systems and help gather comparative data on their quality, independence and efficiency – something individual Member States cannot achieve alone.  EU action is equally crucial in areas needing close coordination with Member States to uphold international justice standards, such as the UN SDGs, and to maintain a unified EU stance on key issues like fundamental rights in the digital sphere and data protection.  Lastly, EU action is essential for advancing justice reforms in candidate countries as part of the enlargement process, particularly in the areas of the rule of law, independence of the judiciary and anti-corruption. These efforts are vital for safeguarding EU justice standards, completing the Single Market and strengthening EU cohesion and prosperity.  In addition to the need for EU action in this field, EU funds have also a strong added value because the EU is best placed to ensure that justice systems across the Union can operate in a harmonised manner. EU intervention has intrinsic added value for EU judicial training since delegating this responsibility at national level would lead to a more inconsistent understanding and implementation of Union law across Member States. This will have negative effects on the overall capacity of national actors to implement EU policies and laws, address cross-border issues and on the development of transnational multi-country projects. Moreover, EU action on justice policies helps boost the Single Market and improves competitiveness. A comprehensive and harmonised justice framework across Member States reduces legal uncertainties and inconsistencies, thereby facilitating smoother cross-border business operations and investments. Predictable enforcement of regulations, consistent protection of intellectual property rights, and effective dispute resolution mechanisms are crucial for maintaining investor confidence and encouraging entrepreneurship and innovation. By providing clear legal standards and ensuring their uniform application, the EU helps companies operate efficiently, reduces transaction costs and enhances the overall attractiveness of the Single Market. This legal predictability also bolsters fair competition by ensuring that businesses face equal conditions irrespective of their country of origin within the EU, thus promoting economic stability and sustainable growth.  · Proportionality  The proposal does not go beyond the minimum required in order to achieve the stated objective at Union level.  · Choice of the instrument  The new 2028-2034 Justice programme builds primarily on the 2021-2027 Justice programme. The most appropriate instrument to operationalise the proposed framework is a regulation.  3. RESULTS OF RETROSPECTIVE EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  · Retrospective evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  The mid-term evaluation of the 2021-2027 J ustice programme highlights that the actions funded by the Programme are coherent with policies and priorities at EU and national levels, aligned with other EU funding instruments and consistent with international commitments and objectives, such as the SDGs 28 . The streamlined architecture of the 2021-2027 P rogramme allows for greater impact and a more focused approach in key areas compared to the previous P rogramme 2014-2020 . Specifically, the 2021-2027 J ustice programme is successfully contributing to support ing the mutual recognition and enforcement of judicial decisions across Member States and to improving cross-border cooperation, by creating a long-term impact through the further development of a cohesive Union area of justice built on mutual trust and cooperation.  Direct funding to beneficiaries has led to immediate and tangible benefits for the target groups involved. In particular , funding for EU networks such as the European Judicial Training Network (EJTN) facilitates sustained collaboration, capacity building, and continuous high-quality engagement among legal professionals across the EU. Furthermore, the P rogramme’s continued emphasis on judicial training significantly contributes to unify and develop the EU legal landscape. The Justice programme plays a crucial role in fostering a shared legal culture by training thousands of judges, lawyers and court staff and by supporting the implementation of the 2021-2024 strategy on European judicial training 29 . By facilitating exchanges of best practice, the P rogramme strengthens Member States ’ collaboration, ensuring that judicial practitioners a pply U nion law in a uniform, coherent and consistent way across borders , thus enhancing the integrity of EU legislation.  The 2021-2027 P rogramme builds on the progress achieved in the previous programming period (2014-2020) , by further reducing barriers to justice and improving frameworks and protections for marginalised individuals 30 . At the same time, its mid-term evaluation points to some areas for improvement . First of all, evidence gathered through stakeholder consultations highlight s the need to expand the P rogramme’s reach . Even if it has already reached a large number of people, awareness of the P rogramme remains limited among certain types of stakeholders 31 and also varies between Member States. This suggests that while the P rogramme’s communication activities are effective, they may not be reaching all sectors and Member States equally 32 . Moreover, some stakeholders suggested includ ing correctional services and prison staff in the P rogramme’s target groups. In order to better reflect the P rogramme’s impact and enhance its added value and visibility, further actions could be considered , e.g. a more systemised process for collecting stakeholders’ perceptions and experiences , and ways to link the existing platforms (such as the EJTN and the e-Justice portal) with successful projects on the EU Funding & Tenders portal. In addition, t o keep increasing the P rogramme’s cost-effectiveness, collaboration with existing EU-level networks could be further explored.  All these findings are taken into account for the 2028-2034 Justice programme presented in this proposal.  I n terms of addressing new challenges, the digitalisation of justice has become a significant cross-cutting objective of the 2021-2027 Justice programme , particularly following the COVID-19 pandemic, which accelerated the use of digital technologies. This focus facilitates easier access to legal information, modernises cross-border judicial cooperation mechanisms and supports broader EU digital transformation goals, making justice systems more efficient and accessible. Investment in digitalisation also strengthens fundamental rights within the justice field, such as the presumption of innocence 33 . Moreover, the increased use of digital tools expands the P rogramme’s reach efficiently. There is still scope to further capitalise on opportunities brought about by digitalisation in the justice field. This is why the 2028-2034 Justice programme will have an increased focus on digitalisation under its general and specific objectives. This will ensure a more strategic and consistent approach to all the issues and challenges related to the digitalisation of justice .  · Stakeholder consultations  The consultation strategy supporting the preparatory work for the Programme included: (i) a first open public consultation (OPC) for the final evaluation of the 2014-2020 Justice programme 2024-2020 and the mid-term evaluation of the 2021-2027 Justice programme 2021-2027; (ii) a second OPC in the domains of cross-border education, youth, culture, media, values and civil society; and (iii) ad hoc consultations that the Commission organised in the form of interviews and targeted surveys with stakeholders.  The first OPC aimed to strengthen the evidence base for the evaluation of the two Justice programmes by gathering the views of relevant stakeholders on the Programmes’ effectiveness, efficiency, relevance, coherence and EU added value. It was launched on 3 April 2024 and was open for 12 weeks (closing on 26 June 2024).  Overall, respondents to this OPC considered the J ustice programme s ’ general and specific objectives to be highly relevant. Among the specific objectives, judicial training and access to justice were considered the most relevant . Moreover , most respondents considered the activities funded by the J ustice programmes to be relevant, in particular those related to developing and maintaining information and communication technology 34 , with digitalisation perceived as an important dimension of the P rogramme. Respondents considered both programmes effective in achieving their objectives and intended results , specifically concerning: (i) improving access for all citizens to CSO services, counselling activities and support activities (assessed as achieved to a very or high extent by 62% of respondents ); (ii) supporting training activities for stakeholders (assessed as achieved to a very high or high extent by 50% of respondents ); and (iii) increasing the cross - border interoperability of systems (assessed as achieved to a very or high extent by 50% of respondents ). In that regard, respondents highlighted the development of E-CODEX and ECRIS, as well as the training in the use of IT tools, as particularly relevant and effective. In terms of coherence, most respondents were not able to compare the J ustice programme with other programmes (only three out of eight respondents indicated that they were familiar with other similar EU initiatives and/or national initiatives in the field of justice). Two respondents considered the J ustice programmes to be complementary to other EU programmes or initiatives to a great extent, and one to a limited extent. There was consensus among respondents on the EU added value of both programmes, with all respondents considering that the EU was best placed to fund the type of activities under the J ustice programme , as EU involvement ensured that all Member States adhere d to the same standards, resulting in more equal access to justice. As a result, most respondents considered that, if the 2021-2027 Justice programme were to stop, Member States would not be able to achieve similar results at national, regional or local level and technical cooperation would become limited to smaller-scale bilateral projects between neighbouring Member States, while some organisations would not be able to secure funding at all. A summary report of the OPC is available on the European Commission’s “ Have your say platform ” 35 .  The second OPC , which inform ed the impact assessment for EU programmes in the domains of cross-border education, youth, culture, media, values and civil society under the 2028-2034 MFF , was carried out between 12 February and 7 May 2025 36 . The EU programmes covered by this OPC were: Creative Europe, Erasmus+, the European Solidarity Corps, the Citizens, Equality, Rights and Values programme and the Justice programme. The purpose of this OPC was to help assess the public perception of the relevance and EU added value of the EU programme s and to identify barriers to their specific impact and potential improvements to the P rogramme s’ architecture. The public consultation received 4 861 responses from 110 countries, encompassing all EU Member States as well as non-EU countries 37 . Most of these responses came from respondents with experience of Erasmus + and the European Solidarity Corps ; o nly 60 respondents declared to have experience with the Justice programme . 51% of responses were submitted by EU citizens. Within this group, around 1 200 respondents were under the age of 30. 49% of responses were submitted by organisations and institutions. These included 17% responses from academic and research bodies , t he majority of which were large institutions, with 69% employing more than 250 people. Another 1 1% of submissions came from non-governmental organisations (NGOs), several of which were umbrella CSO networks. Public authorities accounted for 232 submissions, including a mix of international, national, regional and local entities. A further 208 responses came from companies and businesses . A small number of additional responses (around 45) were received from trade unions, business associations, consumer groups and environmental organisations.  Some of the main results relevant for the justice field are detailed here below:  – According to the respondents, “ uphold and promote the rule of law ” is an important (22.51%) and very important (58.71%) policy priority and an area where EU funding provide added value to a large extent compared to funding at national, local or regional level (50.44%);  – According to the respondents, “ the effective protection of EU funds against fraud, corruption and other illegal activity ” is an important (25.78%) and very important (55.09%) policy priority and an area where EU funding provide added value to a large extent compared to funding at national, local or regional level (54.68%);  – According to the respondents, “ build an EU area of justice, promote judicial training, judicial cooperation and access to justice ” is an important (29.77%) and very important (37.03%) policy priority and an area where EU funding provide added value to a large extent compared to funding at national, local or regional level (47.85%);  – At the same time, the respondents consider that the following actions, which are particularly relevant under the Justice programme, bring to a large extent a positive impact in the future: “ Supporting cross-border mutual learning, exchange of good practices and cooperation, coalition building ” (72.19%), “ Supporting the creation and development of EU-level networks and organisations ” (60.48%), “ Capacity building and training/train-the-trainer activities ” (56.10%), “ Cross-border mutual learning possibilities in the justice area ” (49.08%).  · External expertise  The proposal has been informed by external and internal reports and assessments, e.g. programme evaluations (mid-term and ex post ), the spending review exercise, reports and documents from other EU institutions , agencies and international organisations 38 .  · Impact assessment  The impact assessment on cross-border education, youth, culture, media, values and civil society analysed the future of five funding programmes in this cluster, including the Justice programme.  The two options below were discarded at an early stage:  – A discontinuation of the EU funding : this option was immediately discarded given the importance of the problems affecting the policy areas in this cluster, the prominence given to these policies in the Political Guidelines for the European Commission 2024-2029 39 and the added value of the EU interventions, underpinned by the respective mid-term evaluations .  – Merging the Justice programme with other programmes in this cluster: this option was also discarded at an early stage for legal reasons. The Justice programme cannot be merged with other programmes in this cluster, as not all 27 EU Member States participate in the Justice programme (contrary to the other existing programmes in the cluster). The legal bases of the Regulation establishing the 2021-2027 Justice programme are Article 81(1) and (2) and Article 82 (1) TFEU. These provisions are part of Title V TFEU, which covers the area of freedom, security and justice. By virtue of the Protocols annexed to the Treaties, Denmark does not take part in decisions made under Title V in line with Protocol No 22 (known as ‘opt-out’) and Ireland can choose to take part in certain measures if it decides to ‘opt-in’, in line with Protocol No 21. The other programmes in the scope of the impact assessment are open to all Member States and are therefore incompatible with the legal bases of Title V.  Retained options : The Commission decided to have a stand-alone Justice programme, because both the final evaluation of the 2014-2020 Justice programme and the interim evaluation of the 2021-2027 Justice programme confirmed that the Programme provided unique added value that would be difficult to replicate at national level. This decision is reflected in the post-2027 MFF proposal package presented by the Commission on 16 July 2025.  In line with the Better Regulation Guidelines, the impact assessment report was submitted for quality scrutiny to the Regulatory Scrutiny Board (RSB). The RSB gave an opinion on the impact assessment on 13 June 2025. The RSB made a series of comments and recommendations on the following: scope, problem definition and the use of evaluations, intervention logic and objectives, comparison of options and cost-benefit analysis, governance, coherence, and future monitoring and evaluation. The impact assessment accompanying this legal proposal was reviewed in accordance with the RSB’s comments and recommendations .  · Simplification  The initiative will be in line with the Com m unication on the road to the 2028-2034 MFF 40 and its aim to streamline EU management, governance and implementation of EU programmes to improve efficiency for applicants, beneficiaries and EU institutions. Efforts will be made to simplify the application, management and reporting requirements and to provide additional guidance . Pooling of resources, including in areas such as monitoring and internal and external communication will bring economies of scale and enhance the predictability of EU funding more widely among beneficiaries, stakeholders and EU citizens.  As regards the management mode of the Programme, there is no clear scope for further simplification as the management modes used for the 2021-2027 Justice programme are appropriate for a programme of this size (i.e. direct management and a limited number of initiatives implemented under indirect management by the bodies referred to in point (c) of the first subparagraph of Article 62(1) of Regulation (EU) 2024/2509). During the last years, the Programme has implemented several simplification measures to streamline its processes and administrative procedures, thereby enhancing its efficiency. There is limited evidence to suggest that major changes are still needed, especially considering the simplification measures implemented thus far. For instance, to simplify implementation and reduce administrative burden for beneficiaries, the use of simplified forms of funding will remain the standard form of contribution for reimbursing grants.  Beneficiaries consider the instruments used for the 2021-2027 Justice programme (grants and procurement activities) suitable for the needs of the Programme.  At the same time, several findings show that the growing demand for the digitalisation of justice is highlighting significant investment gaps at both EU and national levels.  A two-level approach (i.e. at EU level and at Member-State level) is therefore necessary to allow the full digitalisation of national justice systems and to build an effective and interconnected Union area of justice.  This would not only create more links with all the policy areas covered under the Justice programme but will also provide for strong coherence with actions carried out at national level for the digitalisation of national justice systems under the National and Regional Partnership plans.  · Fundamental rights  The Programme objectives are closely linked to the promotion of fundamental rights and are in line with the Charter.  In the implementation of all of its actions, the Programme also seeks to promote the Union values set out in Article 2 TEU, gender equality, the rights of the child, including by means of child-friendly justice, the protection of victims’ rights and the effective application of the principle of equal rights and non-discrimination based on any of the grounds listed in Article 21 of the Charter, in accordance with and within the limits set by Article 51 of the Charter.  In addition, projects funded under the Programme must comply with the highest ethical standards , the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 41 and international law agreements to which the Union or all EU Member States are party (including the United Nations Convention on the rights of persons with disabilities 42 ) .  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  The financial envelope for the implementation of the Justice programme for the period 1 January 2028 to 31 December 2034 will be EUR 798 million (current prices).  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  · Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  This initiative will be monitored through the performance framework for the 2028-2034 budget established under Regulation (EU) XXX of the European Parliament and of the Council [Performance Regulation] 43 . The performance framework also sets out the rules for evaluations, which shall be conducted in accordance with the Commission's Better Regulation Guidelines and will be based on indicators relevant to the objectives of the Programme.  The Programme is implemented through direct management by the Commission. A limited number of initiatives might also be implemented under indirect management by international organisations.  · Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  The general objective of the proposed 2028-2034 Justice programme (Article 3 of the Regulation) is to contribute to the further development of an efficient, inclusive, resilient and digitalised Union area of justice, based on the rule of law, mutual recognition and mutual trust. By achieving this objective, the Programme will also strengthen democracy and the protection of fundamental rights and contribute to growth and competitiveness. This general objective will be achieved through three specific objectives:  (a) To facilitate and support judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters, and to promote the rule of law;  (b) To promote and support judicial training;  (c) To facilitate and support effective and non-discriminatory access to justice for all and effective remedy, including by digital means .  The Programme will provide for synergies between its different specific objectives to effectively support the policy areas these objectives cover and increase their potential to reach its target groups. To be effective, the Programme should take into account the specific nature of the different policies, their different target groups and their particular needs through tailor-made approaches.  In implementing this Regulation, the Commission will set the funding priorities in the respective policy areas each year. The structure of the Regulation allows for flexibility and for quick adjustments based on policy needs and new policy and technological developments.  2025/0255 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  establishing the Justice programme for the period 2028-2034 and repealing Regulation (EU) 2021/693  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 81(1) and (2) and Article 82(1) thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 44 ,  Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions 45 ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) Article 3 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) provides that the Union is to offer its citizens an area of freedom, security and justice and Article 67 of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) further specifies that the Union is to constitute an area of freedom, security and justice with respect for fundamental rights and the different legal systems and traditions of the Member States. Justice is closely linked to core values on which the Union is founded, particularly the rule of law , democracy and respect for fundamental rights as enshrined in Article 2 TEU. Those core values imply the necessity of independent judiciaries operating within efficient justice systems. Judicial independence itself stems from the common constitutional traditions shared by all Member States, the rule of law, and from the principle of effective judicial protection provided for in Article 19(1) TEU and Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the ‘Charter’).  (2) The completion of an area of freedom, security and justice is still challenged by factors such as threats to the rule of law, several forms of serious crime and obstacles to access to justice and judicial cooperation. It is therefore more important than ever to promote, strengthen, and defend justice, which has direct implications for the political , economic, financial and social life in the Union and beyond and is necessary to prepare for an enlarged Union . Building on the 2021-2027 Justice programme established by Regulation (EU) 2021/693 of the European Parliament and of the Council 46 , this Regulation aims at establishing the Justice p rogramme (the ‘Programme’) in order to support the further development of a Union area of justice based on the rule of law, fundamental rights, democracy, the independence and impartiality of the judiciary, mutual recognition and mutual trust, access to justice and cross-border judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters. The Programme should also provide an enhanced focus on digitalisation of justice across all its specific objectives.  (3) This Regulation lays down a n indicative financial envelope for the Justice programme . For the purpose of this Regulation, current prices are calculated by applying a fixed 2% deflator.  (4) In a rapidly changing economic, social and geopolitical environment, which creates uncertainties and challenges, recent experience has shown the need for a more flexible multiannual financial framework and Union spending programmes. To that effect, and in line with the objectives of the Justice programme, the funding should duly consider the evolving policy needs and Union’s priorities as identified in relevant documents published by the Commission, in Council conclusions and European Parliament resolutions, while ensuring sufficient predictability for the budget implementation.  (5) Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 of the European Parliament and of the Council 47 applies to the Programme. It lays down the rules on the establishment and the implementation of the general budget of the Union , including the rules on grants, prizes , non-financial donations, procurement, financial assistance, financial instruments and budgetary guarantees.  (6) In accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 , Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council 48 , Council Regulation ( EC Euratom) No 2988/95 49 , Council Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 50 and Council Regulation (EU) 2017/1939 51 , the financial interests of the Union are to be protected through proportionate measures, including the prevention, detection, correction and investigation of irregularities and fraud, the recovery of funds lost, wrongly paid or incorrectly used and, where appropriate, the imposition of administrative sanctions. In particular, in accordance with Regulation s (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 and (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 , the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) may carry out investigations, including on-the-spot checks and inspections, with a view to establishing whether there has been fraud, corruption or any other illegal activity affecting the financial interests of the Union. In accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017/1939, the European Public Prosecutor ’ s Office (EPPO) may investigate and prosecute fraud and other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Union as provided for in Directive (EU) 2017/1371 of the European Parliament and of the Council 52 . In accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 , any person or entity receiving Union funds is to fully cooperate in the protection of the Union’s financial interests, to grant the necessary rights and access to the Commission, OLAF, EPPO and the European Court of Auditors and to ensure that any third parties involved in the implementation of Union funds grant equivalent rights.  (7) The Programme is to be implemented in accordance with Regulation (EU) XXX of the European Parliament and of the Council [Performance Regulation] 53 which establishes the rules for the expenditure tracking and the performance framework for the budget, including rules for ensuring a uniform application of the principles of ‘do no significant harm’ and gender equality referred to in Article 33(2), points (d) and (f), of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 respectively, rules for monitoring and reporting on the performance of Union programmes and activities, rules for establishing a Union funding portal, rules for the evaluation of the programmes, as well as other horizontal provisions applicable to all Union programmes such as those on information, communication and visibility.  (8) Measures under the Programme should support enhanced mutual recognition and enforcement of judgments and judicial decisions in civil and criminal matters, mutual trust between Member States and the necessary approximation of legislation in order to facilitate cooperation between all the relevant authorities, including by digital means. The Programme should also support the maintenance and setting up of existing and new IT tools or platforms for new judicial cooperation instruments. While harvesting the efficiency gains of digitalisation of justice, the protection of fundamental rights, in accordance with the Charter, as well as safeguards against inequalities, discrimination and exclusion should be ensured.  (9) The Programme should, in all its activities, promote the rule of law also by supporting efforts to improve the independence, quality and efficiency of national justice systems in order to enhance mutual trust, which is indispensable for judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters.  (10) In civil matters, the Programme should support the protection of individual rights in civil and commercial cases, including Anti-SLAPP (strategic lawsuits against public participation), and promote greater convergence in civil law. This will help eliminate obstacles to satisfactory and efficiently functioning judicial and extrajudicial procedures for the benefit of all parties in a dispute. To support the effective enforcement and practical application of Union law in this area, the Programme should also support the functioning of the European Judicial Network in civil and commercial matters established by Council Decision 2001/470/EC 54 .  (11) In criminal matters, the Programme should help implement rules and procedures to ensure the recognition of judgments and decisions throughout the Union and support the protection of the Union financial interests. It should contribute to removing obstacles to effective mutual trust and cooperation, including through support for measures that ensure the correct transposition of Union legal acts approximating national criminal laws. The Programme should also support actions aimed at facilitating cooperation in relation to forms of serious crime such as corruption, terrorism and environmental crime . In particular, the Programme should enhanc e coordination and cooperation between law enforcement, judicial authorities and other competent authorities . Furthermore, it should support cooperation with and awareness raising of the role of Union bodies and agencies, such as the European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation ( Eurojust ) and the EPPO, thereby enabling a more integrated system of judicial cooperation in the Union.  (12) The Programme should contribute to improving non-discriminatory access to justice for all and should support activities to protect the rights of victims of crime as well as the procedural rights of suspects and accused persons in criminal proceedings as well as requested persons in European Arrest Warrant ( E AW ) proceedings. Access to justice should include, in particular, access to courts, alternative methods of dispute resolution, and legal advice to be provided in an independent and impartial manner by public office-holders . Particular attention should be given to improved implementation of the various Union legal acts for the protection of victims of crime, as well as to actions aimed at the exchange of best practices between competent authorities, including judicial authorities, law enforcement authorities, legal practitioners and at supporting the improvement of the knowledge and use of collective redress instruments. Moreover, support should be given to activities which facilitate effective and equal access to justice for persons who face discrimination or are in a situation of vulnerability (such as persons with disabilities in accordance with Article 13 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 55 , children, minorities, LGBTIQ + persons and victims of gender-based violence, domestic violence and other forms of interpersonal violence. The Programme should also support activities of civil society organisations which contribute to those objectives.  (13) T he Programme should support the training of the judiciary and judicial staff. T raining activities should contribute to the implementation of Union strategic priorities, including for instance, training on civil and criminal law, on the effective application of the Charter, on mutual recognition as well as on procedural safeguards (including safeguards for strategic lawsuits against public participation (a nti-SLAPP) ) . Training activities under the Programme should have a strong focus on digitalisation of justice, providing a supportive environment for the judiciary and judicial staff , including through increas ing digital skills, knowledge and awareness . Training should also support the digitalisation of cross-border judicial proceedings. S upport to training should happen in synergy with measures at national level, thus leveraging the impact of the P rogramme .  (14) The Programme should support the annual work programme of the European Judicial Training Network (EJTN), which is an essential actor with regard to judicial training and plays an important role in supporting and implementing the objectives of European judicial training policy. The EJTN is the only network at Union level bringing together the judicial training bodies of the Member States . It is therefore in a unique position to organise exchanges and training for the judiciary between Member States and to coordinate the work of national judicial training bodies , thereby fostering synergies between U nion supported and nationally funded training and structured communication between the U nion and national training providers. Moreover, the EJTN may also include the judicial training bodies of candidate countries and potential candidates as observer members.  (15) The protection of children’s rights is a core objective of the Union, as enshrined in Article 3(3) of the TE U and Article 24 of the Charter. In all actions concerning children, the best interests of the child are to be a primary consideration. Th at is essential also for the legitimacy and effectiveness of justice systems. Children involved in legal proceedings , whether as witnesses, victims, suspects, accused or convicted persons, or other parties , often face significant barriers which undermine their ability to participate effectively and to benefit from appropriate safeguards. Strengthening the capacity of national justice systems and practitioners to address the specific needs of children is therefore necessary to ensure the effective exercise of their rights.  (16) The Programme should contribute to digitalisation of justice , including by developing, rolling-out and maintaining tools at Union level. It could thus leverag e tools facilitating digital communication between courts and parties such as the European Elect r onic Access Point, allowing easier access to judicial data such as the European Case Law I dentifier , or enhancing the efficiency and security of digitalised judicial procedures such as trust services under Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 and the European Digital Identity Wallets . A well-functioning Union area of justice with effective and resilient national justice systems is necessary for a flourishing internal market and it is a precondition for economic growth , sound financial markets and competitiveness. Digitalisation enhances the efficiency of cross-border judicial procedures in civil and criminal matters as well as access to justice within the Union, which in turn are a driver for investments. Digitalisation of justice also enables and facilitates the effective and efficient cooperation with other competent authorities in the implementation and enforcement of key pieces of the EU digital rulebook, such as for instance the Digital Services Act. Digitalising justice systems helps also to reduce costs for both public budgets and end users, while maintaining effective services for citizens and businesses. It enables justice professionals to focus on core tasks, improving the quality and efficiency of proceedings. Digital tools also expand access to justice, by allowing remote communication and easy access to judicial files, thereby enhancing transparency. Moreover, digitalisation strengthens the resilience of national justice systems in times of crisis (such as pandemics), ensuring they can continue to operate effectively for the benefit of citizens and businesses . That strengthens trust in the justice system’s ability to function reliably under unexpected circumstances.  (17) The Union must protect its security interest against suppliers which could represent a persistent security risk due to the potential interference from third countries as well as their security, notably cybersecurity . It is therefore necessary to reduce the risk of persisting dependency on high-risk suppliers in the internal market, including in the ICT supply chain, as they could have potentially serious negative impacts on security for users and companies across the Union and the Union’s critical infrastructure in terms of the integrity of data and services as well as the availability of service. This restriction should be based on a proportionate risk assessment and associated mitigation measures as defined in the Union policies and laws.  (18) The Commission should ensure overall consistency, complementarity and synergies with the work of Union bodies, offices and agencies, in particular Eurojust, the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA), the European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (eu-LISA) and the EPPO, and should take into account the work of other national and international actors in the areas covered by the Programme.  (19) In order to ensure the efficient allocation of funds from the general budget of the Union, it is necessary to ensure that all actions carried out under the Programme have Union added value, complement Member States’ actions and are consistent with other Union actions. Consistency, complementarity and synergies should be sought in particular with funding programmes supporting policy areas that are closely interlinked, such as the National and Regional Partnership Plans (established by Regulation XXX of the European Parliament and of the Council [NRP Regulation] 56 ) , the AgoraEU programme ( established by Regulation XXX of the European Parliament and of the Council [AgoraEU] 57 , ), and external actions supported by Global Europe ( established by Regulation XXX of the European Parliament and of the Council 58 ) .  (20) The Programme replaces the programme established by Regulation (EU) 2021/693 for the programming period 2021-2027 which should therefore be repealed.  (21) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No 22 on the position of Denmark, annexed to the TEU and to the TFEU, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application.  (22) In accordance with Article 3 of Protocol No 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, annexed to the TEU and the TFEU, Ireland has notified [, by letter of … ,] its wish to take part in the adoption and application of this Regulation.  or  In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, annexed to the TEU and to the TFEU, and without prejudice to Article 4 of that Protocol, Ireland is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application,  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Article 1  Subject matter  This Regulation establishes the Justice programme (the ‘Programme’) and lays down the objectives of the Programme, its budget for the period 2028-2034, the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding.  Article 2  Definition  For the purposes of this Regulation, ‘judiciary and judicial staff’ means judges, prosecutors and members of staff of courts and of prosecutors’ offices, as well as any other justice professionals associated with the justice systems or otherwise participating in the administration of justice, irrespective of the definition in national law, legal status or internal organisation, such as lawyers, notaries, bailiffs or enforcement officers, insolvency practitioners, mediators, court interpreters and translators, court experts, prison staff and probation officers.  Article 3  Programme objectives  1. The general objective of the Programme is to contribut e to the further development of an efficient, inclusive, resilient and digitalised Union area of justice, based on the rule of law, mutual recognition and mutual trust, thereby also strengthening democracy and the protection of fundamental rights, and contributing to the Union’s growth and competitivenes s , as well as the digitalisation of justice at the U nion l evel.  2. T he Programme has the following specific objectives:  (a) t o facilitate and support judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters, and to promote the rule of law, in particular the independence, quality and efficiency of justice systems, including through improving the effective cross-border recognition and enforcement of judicial decisions;  (b) to promote and support training of the judiciary and judicial staff , with a view to : promoting the rule of law, fundamental rights and democracy; fostering a common legal and judicial culture; ensuring the consistent and effective implementation of the relevant Union legal instruments ; and providing a supportive environment for the digitalisation of judicial cooperation and justice systems .  (c) to facilitate and support effective and non-discriminatory access to justice for all and effective remedy, including by digital means, by promoting efficient civil and criminal procedures and by promoting and supporting the rights of all victims of crime and the procedural rights of suspects and accused persons in criminal proceedings as well as of requested persons in E uropean A rrest W arrant proceedings.  Article 4  Budget  1. The indicative financial envelope for the implementation of the Programme for the period from 1 January 202 8 to 31 December 20 34 is set at EUR 798 000 000 in current prices .  2. Appropriations may be entered in the Union budget beyond 2034 to cover the expenses necessary and to enable the management of actions not completed by the end of the Programme .  3. The financial envelope referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article and the amounts of additional resources referred to in Article 5 may also be used for technical and administrative assistance for the implementation of the Programme, such as preparatory, monitoring, control, audit and evaluation activities , corporate information technology systems and platforms, information and communication activities, including corporate communication on the political priorities of the Union, and all other technical and administrative assistance or staff-related expenses incurred by the Commission for the management of the P rogramme.  Article 5  Additional resources  1. Member States, Union institutions, bodies and agencies, third countries, international organisations, international financial institutions, or other third parties, may make additional financial or non-financial contributions to the P rogramme . Additional financial contributions shall constitute external assigned revenue within the meaning of Article 21(2), points (a), (d), or (e) or Article 21(5) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509.  2. Resources allocated to Member States under shared management may, at their request, be made available to the Programme . The Commission shall implement those resources directly or indirectly in accordance with Article 62(1 ) , point (a) or (c ) , of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509. They shall be additional to the amount referred to in Article 4(1) of this Regulation . Those resources shall be used for the benefit of the Member State concerned. Where the Commission has not entered into a legal commitment under direct or indirect management for additional amounts thus made available to the Programme , the corresponding uncommitted amounts may, at the request of the Member State concerned, be transferred back to one or more respective source programmes or their successors.  Article 6  Alternative, combined and cumulative funding  1. The Programme shall be implemented in synergy with other Union programmes. An action that has received a Union contribution from another programme may also receive a contribution under the Programme . The rules of the relevant Union programme shall apply to the corresponding contribution or a single set of rules may be applied to all contributions and a single legal commitment may be concluded . If the Union contribution is based on eligible costs, the cumulative support from the Union budget shall not exceed the total eligible costs of the action and may be calculated on a pro-rata basis in accordance with the documents setting out the conditions for support.  2. Award procedures under the Programme may be jointly conducted under direct or indirect management with Member States, Union institutions, bodies and agencies, third countries, international organisations, international financial institutions, or other third parties ( ‘partners to the joint award procedure’) , provided the protection of the financial interests of the Union is ensured. Such procedures shall be subject to a single set of rules and lead to the conclusion of single legal commitments. For that purpose, the partners to the joint award procedure may make resources available to the Programme in accordance with Article 5 of this Regulation, or the partners may be entrusted with the implementation of the award procedure, where applicable in accordance with Article 62(1), point (c), of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024 /2509. For the purposes of Article 153(3) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509, in joint award procedures the evaluation committee may be partially composed by members that are representatives of the partners in that procedure.  Article 7  Third countries associated to the Programme  1.

The proposal/initiative relates to:   a new action   a new action following a pilot project / preparatory action 60   the extension of an existing action   a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action  1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative  1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative  Whereas legislation is a key tool to implement the Union’s objectives in the area of justice, it needs to be complemented by other means. In this context, funding has an important role to play to enhance the effectiveness of legislation by increasing knowledge, awareness and capacity of justice professionals and other key stakeholders, through supporting, for instance:  - dissemination of information and awareness raising, including support for national and European campaigns to inform people of their rights and forums for discussion for stakeholders to enhance the knowledge of the Programme and the transferability of its results;  - training, exchanges and capacity building for the judiciary and judicial staff and other practitioners and relevant national authorities, to equip them with the tools to effectively put Union rights and policies into practice.  Funding has also a central role in promoting cooperation at transnational level and developing mutual trust, through, for instance:  - developing and strengthening the capacity of key European-level networks, European-level judicial associations and European level judicial training providers to assist with the preparation of future initiatives in the areas covered by the Programme, as well as to promote their consistent implementation across Europe;  - cross-border cooperation on enforcement and coordination of other national actions to maximise and deepen the impact of Union level actions;  - cross-border interoperability of systems and applications by deploying and maintaining innovative techniques and technologies, notably digital ones.  Additionally, funding should also support, for instance:  - Research, studies, surveys, evaluations, impact assessments, analytical, monitoring and other support activities which allow to be always updated on new improvements and challenges on the ground. The results of these activities will then feed into the development and implementation of Union policies and ensure that they are evidence-based, well targeted and well structured.  The Programme will contribute to tackling common transnational challenges by taking into account the specific nature and challenges of the different policy areas, their different target groups and their particular needs. By bringing together support in these areas, the Union will be better equipped to address recurrent but also new and emerging policy priorities.  The Programme will publish every year around four calls for proposals (including operating grant calls) and support some indirect management activities with international organisations. Some calls will be biennial. In addition to this, the Programme will undertake some actions through contracts following public procurement. The types of activities funded may include, for example: conferences, expert meetings, meetings of committees in support of implementing EU legislative acts, seminars, communication, information and visibility activities; development of training material and development and maintenance of IT platforms and systems; surveys, studies and impact assessments.  All these activities will be implemented over the whole period 2028-2034. It is difficult to set a precise roll-out at this stage, as the Programme has been conceived to remain flexible enough to adapt to new emerging priorities and needs.  1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, greater effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this section ’ added value of EU involvement ’ is the value resulting from EU action, that is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.  Reasons for action at EU level ( ex ante )  Despite progress, the EU continues to face major cross-border justice challenges requiring coordinated action. The Justice programme remains highly relevant and impactful, helping Member States uphold EU values and fundamental rights. Without EU-level support, national responses would be fragmented, inefficient and uneven, especially in areas like judicial training, access to justice, and digitalisation. EU funding enables joint solutions, legal cooperation, and interoperability of justice systems, particularly benefiting smaller Member States. It also helps fill national gaps, sustain EU-wide legal networks and build a common European legal culture. The Justice programme is vital for supporting CSOs working in the field of access to justice and transnational projects that could not be realised otherwise. EU action ensures uniform standards, promotes fair access to justice, strengthens the Single Market and boosts competitiveness by reducing legal uncertainty. It also key to support the EU enlargement process and to ensure coherence between internal and external justice policies, thereby reinforcing the EU’s role globally and safeguarding its legal order.  Expected generated EU added value ( ex post )  Collaboration and networking between stakeholders will lead to the dissemination of best practices, in particular innovative and integrated approaches in different Member States. The participants in the activities funded by the Programme will then act as multipliers in their respective professional activities within their Member State. European Union intervention allows for these activities to be pursued consistently across the Union and brings economies of scale.  1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past  The mid-term evaluation of the 2021-2027 Justice programme showed that the Programme continues to effectively strengthen cross-border judicial cooperation and mutual trust among Member States as well as judicial training and access to justice for vulnerable groups. The Pprogramme is also increasingly promoting digitalisation, thereby improving access to legal information and modernising judicial cooperation tools. The evaluation confirmed the overall effectiveness of the Programme and the validity of its targeted objectives, but some aspects have been identified for improvement, in particular: the limited budget constrains the Programme’s ability to meet growing digital needs; awareness remains uneven, with CSOs less informed than public authorities and the Programme is less known in some countries. Additionally, some beneficiaries continue to experience challenges with the application procedure and reporting requirements.  1.5.4. Compatibility with the multiannual financial framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments  The initiative is part of the 2028-2034 Multiannual Financial Framework proposal.  The Programme will seek synergies, consistency and complementarities with other Union instruments supporting policy areas which are closely interlinked, such as with the AgoraEU programme and the  programmes in the areas of asylum, migration and integration, border management and internal security, consumers, employment, education, social inclusion, research and innovation. Cooperation will be sought as well as with external actions supported by Global Europe and with the National and Regional Partnership Plans for what concerns judicial reforms and digitalisation of national justice systems. Duplication with activities under these other programmes will be avoided.  1.5.5. Assessment of the different available financing options, including scope for redeployment  N/A.  1.6.

Comments  The Programme will be implemented under direct management as well as under indirect management through international organisations (e.g. CoE, UNESCO, OECD…)  2. MANAGEMENT MEASURES  2.1. Monitoring and reporting rules  This initiative will be monitored through the performance framework for the 2028-2034 budget established under Regulation (EU) XXX of the European Parliament and of the Council [Performance Regulation]. The performance framework also sets out the rules for evaluations, which shall be conducted in accordance with the Commission's Better Regulation Guidelines and will be based on indicators relevant to the objectives of the Programme.  2.2. Management and control system(s)  2.2.1. Justification of the budget implementation method(s), the funding implementation mechanism(s), the payment modalities and the control strategy proposed  The Justice programme will be managed directly by the Commission as this allows to better adapt the Programme to the needs of the different policies, have more flexibility to re-adjust priorities in case of emerging needs and establish direct contacts with beneficiaries/contractors and stakeholders directly engaged in activities that serve relevant Union policies. The implementation mode of the 2021-2027 Programme (direct and indirect management) has so far proved effective and suitable for the needs of the Programme and its beneficiaries. The use of simplified forms of funding will remain the standard form of contribution for reimbursing grants.  2.2.2. Information concerning the risks identified and the internal control system(s) set up to mitigate them  The Programme faces the same risks as other Commission programmes that target beneficiaries which are diverse in nature. In particular, some beneficiaries are not recurring or do not have extensive administrative structures. Risks are mainly related to (1) ensuring quality of selected projects and their subsequent technical implementation; (2) risk of inefficient or non-economic use of funds awarded, both for grants and procurement; (3) fraud.  Most of these risks are expected to be reduced thanks to: (1) careful design of calls for proposals; (2) guidance to applicants and beneficiaries; (3) the use of the simplified cost options of unit costs, flat rates and lump sums, which have been effectively applied in the 2021-2027 MFF and are provided in the Regulation (EU) 2024/2509); (4) the use of corporate procedures and systems for the management of proposals and grants (e.g. grants vademecum, eGrants etc.) to ensure a full alignment with best practice in all stages of the grant and procurement lifecycles; (5) the measures laid down in the anti-fraud strategy.  The control system envisaged for the 2028-2034 Programme will be a continuation of the 2021-2027 control system. The control strategy is composed of different building blocks: (1) programming, evaluation and selection of proposals to ensure that only best proposals are funded; (2) signing and monitoring of grant agreements, subject to ex ante verification at both financial and policy level; (3) ex post audits based on a ‘detection strategy’ aimed at identifying a maximum of anomalies in view of recovering undue payments.  2.2.3. Estimation and justification of the cost-effectiveness of the controls (ratio between the control costs and the value of the related funds managed), and assessment of the expected levels of risk of error (at payment & at closure)  The cost of controls of the Programme amounts to approximately 3.2% of the payments done by the Commission. This is expected to stay stable or slightly decrease if the use of simplified cost options is further expanded. The objective for the management and control system is to maintain the expected levels of risk of error (at payment and at closure) below the materiality threshold of 2%.  2.3. Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities  DG JUST will continue to apply its Anti-Fraud Strategy (updated in June 2024) in line with the Commission’s Anti-Fraud Strategy (CAFS) in order to ensure, inter alia, that its internal anti-fraud related controls are fully aligned with the CAFS and that its fraud risk management approach is geared to identify fraud risk cases and adequate responses.  The Anti-fraud strategy enables fraud risk to be addressed, mainly via measures to prevent irregularity which are then escalated in the event of fraud detection. The following measures will continue to be implemented: desk monitoring, monitoring missions in accordance with a defined monitoring strategy, clear reporting requirements in the grant agreements with beneficiaries, kick-off meetings with new beneficiaries, possibility to cut grants upon non-delivery of results or non-compliance with certain funding conditions such as those linked to information, communication and visibility.  Beneficiaries in exclusion cases are submitted to the Early Detection and Exclusion Database (EDES) and cases are followed up with OLAF and the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO).  3.

The estimation of the operational staff working on the Programme is based on a distribution corresponding to the share of Justice budget against the total programme budget managed by the DG, which also includes the CERV programme and the consumer strand of the Single Market Programme.  The estimation of staff from policy units is based on the high number of policies and pieces of legislation supported by the Justice programme implementation, hence on policy units involvement at key stages of the process, such as preparation of the calls for proposals, project selection and implementation.  Operational, policy and coordination staff combined amount to 60 FTE, including 5 CA funded from outside Heading 4 (former BA lines), which is considered necessary to effectively cater for the expanded more labour intensive portfolio – including, in particular, initiatives such as the digitalisation of justice, increased number of financial operations for the implementation of the Programme, and in line with the thematic scope of the Programme as per political guidelines.  Starting from the current staffing level as baseline, and considering the 2.7 fold increase in the envelope of the Justice programme in the next MFF, the FTEs requested is necessary to enable DG JUST to cope with the actions required to reach the political objectives of the Von der Leyen II Commission with the 2028-2034 Justice programme being instrumental in successfully delivering on the Commission’s ambitions.  There is no margin in the current teams to further redeploy staff between functions without putting at risk the credibility of the Commission to deliver in the areas of DG JUST’s competence.

Alignment with the European Data Strategy The provisions under the proposal support interoperability, reusability, and secure data sharing, in line with the European Data Strategy. Where personal data are processed ( e.g. participants), it aligns with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 65 . The architecture is also consistent with the Open Data Directive 66 , as relevant aggregated, non-personal data may be made available for reuse by researchers or public bodies. Alignment with EU Digital Identity Framework The proposal aligns with the EU Digital Identity Framework, which enables secure identification and the use of electronic attestations of attributes to verify specific characteristics or qualifications of individuals, economic operators and organisations, including in the context of justice and legal proceedings. Furthermore, the proposal will be compatible with the forthcoming European Business Wallets, which will further enable the sharing of attestations in professional contexts, such as in cross-border legal proceedings, allowing legal professionals and businesses to securely and efficiently share verified information with courts, public administrations, and other partners, thereby reducing administrative burdens and increasing trust in digital justice systems. Alignment with the once-only principle Dashboards established are the source of traceability and reusability of the data available from the Programme implementation. Data comes from the project lifecycle tools/documents (e.g. application forms, final reports, participant surveys). Traceability and reusability of the data available from the Programme implementation will be ensured. The data will be recorded via the project lifecycle documents and made accessible, in line with the provisions of the Regulation (EU) XXX of the European Parliament and of the Council [Performance Regulation] regarding transparency of information on programmes performance and achievements through the Single Gateway portal.

General comment : The exchange of data between the Member States is of key importance for the success of the various initiatives in the field of digitalisation of justice. A number of initiatives are dependent on data and its availability. A good example is the EU Strategy for the digitalisation of justice, planned to be adopted by the end of 2025. Another example for the exchange of data is the European Legal Data Space 67 , which aims to ensure the availability of judicial data, including for the purposes of training AI.

Some examples of IT systems, which will be funded by the continuation of the Justice p rogramme, are the European e-Justice Portal, which is a one stop-shop for all justice matters, and the decentralised IT system developed under Regulation (EU) 2023/2844 72 for the digitalisation of cross-border judicial cooperation. The Justice p rogramme is used to fund IT systems at EU level stemming from legal instruments or from the voluntary cooperation of Member States. In both cases, these are systems with high political and operational importance for Member States, which support the smooth day-to-day functioning of the justice sector by enhancing efficiency and ensuring interoperability.; Digital solution; Reference(s) to the requirement(s); Main mandated functionalities; Responsible body; How is accessibility catered for?; How is reusability considered?; Use of AI technologies (if applicable); Digital solution #1 – Direct Grant Management platform; Article 4; Direct Grant Management; European Commission; In accordance with Commission Standard; //; The platform shall leverage the use artificial intelligence where relevant and adhering with the precautionary principle.; Digital solution #2 – Platform(s) to support the Programme; Article 3, par. 1 and par. 2 (b) and (c) and Article 4; Disseminate Programme’s results; European Commission; In accordance with Commission Standard; //; The platform(s) shall leverage the use artificial intelligence where relevant and adhering with the precautionary principle.; Digital and/or sectorial policy (when these are applicable); Explanation on how it aligns; AI Act 68; When leveraging AI, the European Commission will ensure the compliance with the AI Act.; EU Cybersecurity framework 69; Without prejudice to Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the European Commission shall ensure the security, integrity, authenticity and confidentiality of the data collected and stored for the purpose of this regulation; EU Digital Identity Framework, European Business Wallets; In accordance with the EU Digital Identity Framework, the Commission shall ensure that the grant management platform is interoperable with the EU Digital Identity Wallets and the forthcoming European Business Wallets to enable identification, authentication, the exchange of electronic attestations of attributes and the use of trust services.”; ; ; Single Digital Gateway 70 and IMI 71; NA; Others; NA; Digital and/or sectorial policy (when these are applicable); Explanation on how it aligns; AI Act; When leveraging AI, the European Commission will ensure the compliance with the AI Act.; EU Cybersecurity framework; Without prejudice to Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the European Commission shall ensure the security, integrity, authenticity and confidentiality of the data collected and stored for the purpose of this regulation; EU Digital Identity Framework, European Business Wallets; In accordance with the EU Digital Identity Framework, the Commission shall ensure that these platforms are interoperable with the EU Digital Identity Wallets and the forthcoming European Business Wallets to enable identification, authentication, the exchange of electronic attestations of attributes and the use of trust services.”; ; ; Single Digital Gateway and IMI; NA; Others; NA Row 2 — Digital solution; Reference(s) to the requirement(s); Main mandated functionalities; Responsible body; How is accessibility catered for?; How is reusability considered?; Use of AI technologies (if applicable) Row 3 — Digital solution #1 – Direct Grant Management platform; Article 4; Direct Grant Management; European Commission; In accordance with Commission Standard; //; The platform shall leverage the use artificial intelligence where relevant and adhering with the precautionary principle.

These include the European judicial training strategy , the EU strategy on victims’ rights , the Council’s European e-justice strategy , the EU strategy on the rights of the child , and the forthcoming Commission strategy on digitalisation of justice that aims to promote digital transformation within justice systems. Moreover, to further uphold the rule of law, the European Commission established the rule of law mechanism , including the annual rule of law report , which evaluates developments in judicial independence, anti-corruption frameworks and access to justice in Member States. The Commission’s anti-corruption package , adopted in 2023, introduced comprehensive measures to combat corruption, enhance transparency and safeguard judicial integrity throughout the Union. The EU has also adopted an internal security strategy and a counter-terrorism agenda .  For instance, insights from the EU Justice Scoreboard 2024 and data collected via recent Eurobarometer surveys highlighted progress in Member States’ efforts to deliver effective national justice systems, but these insights also suggest that there is a continued need for improvement. Possible improvements include: (i) the need to reduce the burden of court fees; (ii) the availability of legal aid; (iii) the promotion of voluntary use of alternative dispute resolution methods (ADRs); (iv) support for the participation of persons with disabilities as professionals in the justice system; and (v) facilitating access to justice by electronic means, because the uptake of digitalisation in national justice systems across EU Member States remains uneven. In addition, cross-border crimes have continued to rise since 2020, suggesting cross-border judicial cooperation will only become more important.

The initiative addresses challenges such as gaps in legal protection and uneven progress in digitalization, emphasizing judicial independence and universal access to justice. A significant aspect of the proposal is the use of EU funding to bolster national justice systems and improve the capabilities of legal practitioners.

The programme highlights the importance of digital tools and artificial intelligence in modernizing justice systems, making them more accessible, transparent, and efficient. This modernization is expected to enhance legal certainty and cross-border cooperation, with digital systems providing resilience during crises and reinforcing public trust. Feedback from stakeholders, including EU citizens and organizations, informed the proposal, focusing on upholding the rule of law and protecting children's rights.

To address transnational challenges, the programme considers the specific needs of different policy areas and target groups. It will publish annual calls for proposals, supporting activities like conferences, expert meetings, and training material development. Designed to be flexible, the programme will adapt to emerging priorities over its duration. A critical aspect of the proposal is the management and control system, which aims to maintain the expected levels of risk of error below the materiality threshold of 2%. To prevent fraud and irregularities, the European Commission's Directorate-General for Justice will continue to oversee the programme.

CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons and objectives  The Commission Political Guidelines 2024-2029 emphasise that migration is a European challenge that must be met with a European solution. Europe’s geopolitical context has significantly changed, profoundly affecting the Union’s migration and asylum management, which has been further impacted by the weaponisation of migration. Member States need to be able to rapidly and effectively respond to developments of migratory flows and receive Union support for that purpose.  With the adoption of the Pact on Migration and Asylum (the ‘Pact’) the Union has made a significant progress toward a comprehensive approach to asylum, migration and border management, including its external dimension. The Pact sets up a system governed by the principle of solidarity and the fair sharing of responsibility, including its financial implications, between the Member States. The success of the new system created by the Pact relies on the readiness of all Member States – with the actions of one having implications for all. The Pact implementation has to be manageable for everyone and be managed together.  The Pact requires Member States to develop National Implementation Plans based on the Common Implementation Plan of the Commission. It is clear from those plans that significant financial resources will be needed in the years ahead. Member States need to make the necessary reforms to ensure national systems are efficient and fit-for-purpose in line with the Pact obligations and that the European system created by the Pact functions as it should.  This also implies providing adequate EU funds to support its implementation. In addition to the immediate needs that will be funded under the current Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027, Member States will need to continue investing and improving their systems. For example, every three years the Commission will reassess the ‘adequate capacity’ obligations of Member States for the implementation of the border procedure. This reassessment may require that Member States make further investments to fulfil their obligations.  Furthermore, the need to develop national integrated case management systems bringing together asylum, reception, and return has been identified by the Commission as a key priority in almost all Member States. The significant changes required in many Member States to build these integrated systems and embrace the digitalisation agenda will require significant investments in the medium-to-long term. This digitalisation, including the evolution of the artificial intelligence-based (AI) technology, is also a key component for simplifying and increasing the efficiency of the system which could eventually lead to the creation of European case-management systems.  While it should be supported mostly through the Regulation (EU) […] [Global Europe], the external dimension and innovative solutions to migration and asylum management would continue in the years to come to play an important part in the EU response. Member States and the EU should also have certain margin to be able to support specific activities in third countries.  Finally, the Pact obligations have created significant needs in terms of personnel, including case workers, legal advisers, monitors for fundamental rights, representatives for unaccompanied minors, vulnerability experts and so on, as well as new obligations regarding reception with significant running costs. These are key components that ensure the European system works in practice. Systemic failures in these areas in one Member State impact all Member States. It is thus fundamental that the EU supports Member States in this endeavour. Furthermore, Member States’ needs will have to be reassessed regularly based on the evaluation of the migratory situation. The ultimate objective is to ensure that all Member State will continuously have a ‘well-prepared system’.  The scope of the Union support should be coherent with the policy priorities and flexible, so to allow for new developments to be taken into account. Building on the results and investments in the areas of asylum and migration from the previous programming periods, this proposal provides the necessary Union support to achieve the objectives of the comprehensive approach to migration and asylum . It also offers support for legal migration and early integration of third-country nationals as well as horizontal measures supporting Member States’ capacities in the field of integration.  Furthermore, Union support should be available for the new common approach and legislative framework proposed by the Commission 1 with swifter, simpler and more effective return procedures across the EU and innovative solutions for migration management . This new legal framework for returns constitutes a key piece to complement the Pact on Migration and Asylum .  The proposal aims to address the need for greater flexibility in the management of the Union support, including a stronger performance orientation, as well as enhanced simplification for all actors involved in its implementation. For this, strict complementarity is enforced with the proposal for a Regulation (EU) […] establishing the European Fund for economic, social and territorial cohesion, agriculture and rural, fisheries and maritime, prosperity and security, introducing new mechanisms for the allocation of funding for shared, direct and indirect management. As challenges in the area of migration and asylum are constantly evolving, there is also a need to respond to pressing needs and changes in policy and Union priorities, and to steer funding towards actions with a high level of Union added value, in particular through an EU Facility offering flexibility in the management of the Union support.  The present proposal, together with the proposal for a Regulation (EU) […] establishing the Union support for the Schengen area, for European integrated border management and for the common policy on visas and the proposal for a Regulation (EU) […] establishing the Union Support for  internal security, provide the specific legal framework for the Union action in the areas of efficient management of migration and asylum, European integrated border management at the external borders, well-functioning Schengen area and European visa policy, and internal security. The rules regulating the participation of some Member States of the European Union to the rules established in accordance with Title V of Part Three TFEU (see variable geometry section) justify the need to have three specific instruments to provide support in these areas. These three Regulations complement each other and the proposal for Regulation (EU) […] establishing the European Fund for economic, social and territorial cohesion, agriculture and rural, fisheries and maritime, prosperity and security, through which they will be implemented.  The proposed Regulation builds on Regulation (EU) 2021/1147 2 , while taking into account new policy developments and the need to provide an agile response to evolving migration and asylum challenges both within the EU and in cooperation with other countries.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions  The Union support for asylum, migration and integration will work in complementarity with the other policies under the scope of the proposal for establishing the European Fund for economic, social and territorial cohesion, agriculture and rural, fisheries and maritime, prosperity and security, thus fostering synergies between these policies. However, a strong and comprehensive EU policy on migration and asylum needs action across the full spectrum of the tools at its disposal, including activities of relevant Union decentralised agencies.  The six Home Affairs decentralised Agencies (Frontex, Europol, EUAA, eu-LISA, EUDA and Cepol) play an important and increasing role in the implementation of the Home Affairs policies. It is essential to ensure coherence between policy strategies set out at EU level and the operational activities of the decentralised agencies, thereby also maximising the contribution to the EU policy objectives from the EU funding provided to the decentralised agencies. The operational role of the decentralised agencies may require further strengthening, accompanied by corresponding increase of funding.  • Consistency with other Union policies  Union migration policy relies on the synergies and coherence with relevant EU policies such as border management, internal security, and the social inclusion and integration of third-country nationals. In addition, consistency and complementarity will also be ensured with the Union external policies supporting third countries through Regulation (EU) […] [Global Europe] in a wide range of areas with important links to internal policies, including migration and asylum, which should ensure an increased coherence with the Union’s support for cooperation on migration with partner countries, contributing to a coordinated, holistic and structured approach to migration, maximising synergies and increasing leverage. In this context, the synergies between the support to cross-border cooperation under Global Europe and the one that can be provided under this Regulation are particularly relevant for enhancing border management and pursuing efforts to prevent irregular migration. To promote those synergies, enhanced coordination and consistency should be sought between policy priorities and EU spending towards third countries.  This proposal is also consistent with the priorities set out in the Union of Skills’ external strand on attracting and retaining skills from third countries, including the future legal gateway offices, which can be supported by initiatives such as the EU Talent Pool and the Talent Partnerships. To support the competitiveness agenda, investments based on innovative methods or new technologies, including measures aiming to test and validate the outcome of Union-funded research projects should also be considered.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  Article 3(2) of the Treaty on European Union provides that ‘the Union shall offer its citizens an area of freedom, security and justice without internal frontiers, in which the free movement of persons is ensured in conjunction with appropriate measures with respect to external border controls, asylum, immigration and the prevention and combating of crime’. The legal basis for this proposal can be found in Article 78(2) as well as in Article 79(2) and Article 79(4) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the Union (TFEU).  • Variable geometry  This Regulation is based on legal bases under Title V of Part Three TFEU, concerning the area of freedom, security and justice. As a consequence, the application of the Regulation to Denmark and Ireland is subject to special provisions laid down in Protocol No 21 and Protocol No 22 annexed to the TEU and the TFEU.  In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No 22, Denmark does not take part in the adoption by the Council of measures proposed pursuant to Title V of Part Three TFEU, and such measures are not binding upon or applicable in Denmark.  In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No 21, Ireland does not take part in the adoption by the Council of measures proposed pursuant to Title V of Part Three TFEU, and such measures are not binding on or applicable in Ireland. However, Ireland may choose to take part in the adoption and application of any such proposed measure. In addition, anytime after the adoption of such a measure, Ireland may accept the measure, subject to the completion of procedures referred to in Article 4 of Protocol No 21.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  The objectives of the proposal cannot be achieved by Member States acting alone, as the challenges are of a cross-border nature, and not limited to single Member States or to a subset of Member States. Union support creates added value by promoting a common approach across Member States when implementing EU acquis and standards and fostering collaboration between Member States on transnational issues.  • Proportionality  The proposal does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives mentioned under section 1. It falls within the scope for action in the area of freedom, security and justice, as defined in Title V of Part Three TFEU. The objectives and corresponding Union support are proportionate to what the instrument aims to achieve.  • Choice of the instrument  The most appropriate instrument for operating the current proposal is a Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council establishing the Union support for asylum, migration and integration for the period from 1 January 2028 to 31 December 2034, complementing the proposal for Regulation (EU) […] establishing the European Fund for economic, social and territorial cohesion, agriculture and rural, fisheries and maritime, prosperity and security.  3. RESULTS OF RETROSPECTIVE EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Retrospective evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  The preliminary outcomes of the ongoing ex-post evaluation of the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) for the 2014-2020 programming period confirm that the AMIF contributed to the objectives intended by the Fund to a variable extent. Stakeholders perceived the administrative burden as proportionate to the benefits and similar to other EU Funds, but less proportionate in comparison to national funds. The introduction of simplified cost options was viewed positively, although their use was relatively limited. The AMIF demonstrated good coherence with the European Social Fund, which according to stakeholders could be further reinforced. The AMIF strongly contributed to the introduction of new services, the ability to reach a broader audience and the expansion of services and innovation. Overall, the ex-post evaluation underlines the need to enhance simplification in the implementation of the fund, notably by reducing reporting requirements and expanding the use of simplified cost options. The evaluation also pleads for reducing rigidities in the management of the budget, including by introducing more flexible budgeting mechanisms easing cross-fertilisation between different objectives and decreasing the number of programmes’ modifications.  The preliminary outcomes of the mid-term evaluation of the AMIF for the 2021-2027 programming period confirm that the monitoring and evaluation framework for AMIF has significantly improved compared to the 2014-2020 programming period. Simplified cost options and flat-rate technical assistance have contributed to reducing administrative burden, yet the implementation of simplified cost options is still relatively limited. The AMIF demonstrates strong coherence with the programming of other EU Funds, particularly the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+), the Instrument for financial support for Border Management and Visa Policy (BMVI) and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF). The mid-term evaluation broadly confirms the conclusions of the ex-post evaluation concerning the need for more simplification and flexibility in the management of the programmes and projects, to adapt quickly to the impact of external factors. The mid-term evaluation underlines the need to reinforce the links and coordination with the other Union Funds, especially in view of the implementation of the Pact on Migration and Asylum. This could also help national authorities to better cover relevant needs through a more coordinated programming of the Union Funds.  • Stakeholder consultations  The Commission actively engaged with the stakeholders in the process of the initiative, notably through dedicated events and public consultation activities, as detailed in the corresponding chapter of the explanatory memorandum of the proposal for a Regulation (EU) […] establishing the European Fund for economic, social and territorial cohesion, agriculture and rural, fisheries and maritime, prosperity and security.  • External expertise  Information about the Commission’s use of external expertise is provided in the corresponding chapter of the explanatory memorandum of the proposal for a Regulation (EU) […] establishing the European Fund for economic, social and territorial cohesion, agriculture and rural, fisheries and maritime, prosperity and security.  • Impact assessment  Information about the Commission’s Impact Assessment is provided in the corresponding chapter of the explanatory memorandum of the proposal for a Regulation (EU) […] establishing the European Fund for economic, social and territorial cohesion, agriculture and rural, fisheries and maritime, prosperity and security.  • Simplification  The initiative is expected to contribute to a significant reduction of administrative burden and costs, as well as improved efficiency in the implementation of Union support, see also the corresponding chapter of the explanatory memorandum of the proposal for a Regulation (EU) […] establishing the European Fund for economic, social and territorial cohesion, agriculture and rural, fisheries and maritime, prosperity and security.  • Fundamental rights  The Union support will be implemented in compliance with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the principle of the rule of law, as set out in Article 2(a) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2020/2092, see also the corresponding section in the Explanatory Memorandum accompanying the Commission proposal for the proposal for a Regulation (EU) […] establishing the European Fund for economic, social and territorial cohesion, agriculture and rural, fisheries and maritime, prosperity and security.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  The indicative financial envelope for the implementation of the objectives under the Union support is set at EUR 11 975 428 500 for the period from 2028 to 2034 in current prices. It shall be implemented in compliance with the horizontal rules for the National and Regional Partnership Plans laid down in Regulation (EU) […] establishing the European Fund for economic, social and territorial cohesion, agriculture and rural, fisheries and maritime, prosperity and security.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  The Union support under this proposal will be implemented through shared management by the Member States and direct and indirect management by the Commission. The implementation of the Union support will be monitored through the performance framework applicable for the 2028-2034 multiannual financial framework set out in the proposal for a Regulation (EU) […] establishing a budget expenditure tracking and performance framework and other horizontal rules of the Union programmes and activities.  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  The proposed Regulation defines in Article 1 the scope of the Union support for the Asylum, Migration and Integration for the period from 1 January 2028 to 31 December 2034. For this, essential definitions are given in Article 2, and four objectives are set out in Article 3, which will be achieved through Union support under the horizontal rules of the European Fund for economic, social and territorial cohesion, agriculture and rural, fisheries and maritime, prosperity and security established by Regulation (EU) […]. These objectives refer to the areas of the Common European Asylum System; return and readmission of irregular migrants, including their reintegration in third countries and countering irregular migration; legal migration and early integration and social inclusion of third-country nationals; solidarity and fair sharing of responsibility between the Member States.  In Article 4 the proposal lays down provisions for the financing of the Union support  To foster the implementation of the Union acquis and to support efforts to ensure a comprehensive approach to the management of migration grounded on mutual trust, solidarity and fair sharing of responsibility between Member States, the proposed Regulation also sets out the rules for the budgetary treatment of the resources for resettlement and humanitarian admission (Article 5 ) , the resources for the transfer of applicants for international protection or of beneficiaries of international protection (Article 6 ) , and the financial contributions from Member States for the purpose of the Annual Solidarity Pool established by Regulation (EU) 2024/1351 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 May 2024 3 (Article 9 ) .  Article 7 defines the necessary conditions to be fulfilled by third countries to be associated to the Union support provided under this proposal . Article 8 covers the funding of the European Migration Network set up by Council Decision 2008/381/EC 4 in accordance with its objectives and tasks. Article 1 0 lays down transitional provisions . The date of the entry into force of the proposed Regulation is set in Article 1 1 , and it is stipulated that the Regulation will be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States in accordance with the Treaties from 1 January 2028.  2025/0540 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  establishing the Union support for asylum, migration and integration for the period from 2028 to 2034  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 78(2) and Article 79(2) and (4) thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 5 ,  After consulting the Committee of the Regions,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure 6 ,  Whereas:  (1) The purpose of this Regulation is to contribute to the Union’s objective of constituting an area of freedom, security and justice in accordance with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) through provision of Union support for the development of a common policy on asylum, subsidiary protection and temporary protection with a view to offering appropriate status to any third-country nation al requiring international protection and ensuring compliance with the principle of non-refoulement in accordance with Article 77 TFEU,  and a common immigration policy aimed at ensuring, at all stages, the efficient management of migration flows, fair treatment of third-country nationals residing legally in Member States, and the prevention of, and enhanced measures to combat, illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings in accordance with Article 79 TFEU.  (2) The entry into force of the Pact on Migration and Asylum in June 2024 has reshaped the Union’s asylum and migration policy. To foster t he implementation of the Pact and to support efforts to ensure a comprehensive approach to the management of migration that is grounded on solidarity and fair sharing of responsibility between Member States, Union institutions and agencies, Member States should be supported by adequate financial resources. This Union support will be provided under the horizontal rules of the European Fund for economic, social and territorial cohesion, agriculture and rural, fisheries and maritime, prosperity and security established by Regulation (EU) […] .  (3) This Regulation lays down the objectives of the Union support on asylum, migration and integration policy. Member States should ensure that their National and Regional Partnership Plan s address each of the objectives set out by this Regulation.  (4) The amounts to be allocated per Member State should be set out by the Commission in accordance with the allocation methodology laid down in Regulation (EU) […] establishing the European Fund for economic, social and territorial cohesion, agriculture and rural, fisheries and maritime, prosperity and security through a single implementing decision. That decision should as a rule also cover the amounts under the Regulation (EU) […] establishing the European Fund for economic, social and territorial cohesion, agriculture and rural, fisheries and maritime, prosperity and security , the Regulation (EU) […] establishing the Union support for the Schengen area, for European integrated border management and for the common policy on visas and the Regulation (EU) […] establishing the Union Support for  internal security .  (5) The Union support should build on the results and investments in the areas of asylum and migration from the previous programming periods: (i) the European Refugee Fund established by Decision No 573/2007/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 7 for the period 2008-2013 ; (ii) the European Fund for the Integration of third-country nationals established by Council Decision 2007/435/EC 8 for the period 2007-2013 ; (iii) the European Return Fund established by Decision No 575/2007/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 9 for the period 2008-2013 ; (iv) the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund established by Regulation (EU) No 516/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council 10 for the period 2014-2020, and (v) the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund for the period 2021-2027, established by Regulation (EU) 2021/1147 of the European Parliament and of the Council 11 . The scope of the Union support should also allow for new developments to be taken into account.  (6) Europe’s geopolitical context has significantly changed, profoundly affecting the Union’s migration management, also due to the role of State actors in artificially creating and facilitating irregular migration, instrumentalising migratory flows as a tool for political purposes, and to the use of hybrid warfare tactics, such as the weaponi s ation of migration 12 , to destabilise the European Union and its Member States . Member States need to be able to rapidly and effectively respond to developments of migratory flows and receive Union support for that purpose. To respond to these European challenges, the allocation of Union support should reflect the Union’s priorities . Therefore, the Union support implemented under the rules governing the Member States National and Regional Partnership Plans should contribute to effectively addressing the challenges identified in the context of the long-term European Asylum and Migration Management Strategy and the annual migration management cycle established in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2024/1351 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 May 2024 13 , including the annual solidarity mechanism and the Union Resettlement and Humanitarian Admission Framework.  This Union support under this Regulation should finance measures tailored to the needs of third-country nationals that are generally implemented in the early stages of integration, as well as horizontal measures supporting Member States’ capacities in the field of integration, whereas interventions for third-country nationals with a longer-term impact should be pursued under other Union supports.  (7) As challenges in the area of migration and asylum are constantly evolving, there is a need to adapt the allocation of the Union support under this Regulation to the changes in migration flows and asylum . To respond to pressing needs and changes in policy and Union priorities, and to steer funding towards actions with a high level of Union added value, part of the Union support under this Regulation should be implemented in direct, shared and indirect management via the EU Facility established pursuant to Regulation (EU) […] establishing the European Fund for economic, social and territorial cohesion, agriculture and rural, fisheries and maritime, prosperity and security . The EU Facility offers flexibility in the management of the Union support, and, for shared management, it should be implemented through the Member States’ National and Regional Partnership Plans.  (8) The Commission and the Member States should ensure that the knowledge, expertise and experience of relevant Union bodies, offices and agencies are taken into account in the development of Member States’ National and Regional Plans and when implementing measures or addressing challenges in relation to migration management, border control and management and internal security. Where appropriate, the Commission should also be able to involve the relevant Union bodies, offices and agencies in activities aiming to ensure that the measures supported by the Union support comply with the relevant Union acquis and agreed Union priorities .  (9) The Union support should also contribute to the implementation of temporary protection in relation to Council Directive 2001/55/EC 14 in the event of a mass influx of displaced persons , including of temporary protection introduced and extended by past Council decisions, and the implementation of measures to promote a balance of efforts between the Member States hosting such persons.  (10) The Member States should build on the principle of partnership in the implementation of the Union support to ensure continuity in the governance approach.  (11) The Union support should contribute to ensuring consistency, coherence, synergies and complementarities between the Union’s internal and external policies. An increased coherence is needed between migration, asylum, return and external policies and it is important to ensure that the Union’s external assistance and Union support under this Regulation contribute to a coordinated, holistic and structured approach to migration, maximising synergies and increasing leverage. Union support under this Regulation may also include support to the relevant resources of the EU delegations in duly justified cases, and be coordinated between the Member States and the Commission in programming and implementation stages.  (12) Europe must protect its security interest s against suppliers which could represent a persistent security risk due to the potential interference from third countries as well as their cybersecurity practices. It is therefore necessary to reduce the risk of persisting dependency on high-risk suppliers in the internal market, as they could have potentially serious negative impacts on security for users, companies and authorities across the EU in terms of the integrity of data and services as well as the availability of service. This exclusion should be based on a proportionate risk assessment and associated mitigation measures as defined in the Union policies and laws .  (13) Resettlement and humanitarian admission are safe and legal alternatives to irregular migration and a tool of European solidarity with countries that are not Member States and which host large numbers of persons fleeing war or persecution. Resettlement and humanitarian admission efforts by the Member States undertaken in the framework of Regulation (EU) 2024/1350 of the European Parliament and of the Council 15 should be supported by appropriate funding from the Union's budget. In view of the specific nature of the support needed for purposes of resettlement and humanitarian admission and for the transfer of applicants for international protection or of beneficiaries of international protection, it is necessary to provide in this Regulation for pre-identified amounts per unit for such support.  (14) This Regulation should also ensure the continuation of the European Migration Network set up by Council Decision 2008/381/EC 16 in accordance with its objectives and tasks.  (15) Given that Member States subject to migratory pressure should be able to rely on Union support, this Regulation should set out the rules in order to make available to benefitting Member States the respective share of the financial contributions included in the Annual Solidarity Pool established by Regulation (EU) 2024/1351 17 .  (16) A third country that has concluded an agreement with the Union on the criteria and mechanisms for establishing the State responsible for examining a n application for international protection registered in a Member State or registered in that third country should be allowed to participate in the Union support through this Regulation provided certain conditions are fulfilled.  (17) All actions supported in accordance with the Union support under this Regulation should be implemented in compliance with the rights and principles enshrined in the Union acquis and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and should be in line with the international obligations of the Union and the Member States arising from the international instruments to which they are party.  (18) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No 22 on the position of Denmark, annexed to the TEU and to the TFEU, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application.  (19) [ In accordance with Article 3 of Protocol No 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, annexed to the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and the TFEU, Ireland has notified [, by letter of … ,] its wish to take part in the adoption and application of this Regulation .  OR  In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, annexed to the Treaty of the European Union (TEU) and to the TFEU, and without prejudice to Article 4 of that Protocol, Ireland is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application],  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Article 1  Subject matter  This Regulation lays down the objectives and financing of the Union support for the implementation, strengthening and development of the common policy on asylum and the common immigration policy for the period from 1 January 2028 to 31 December 2034.

This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in the Member States in accordance with the Treaties.  Done at Brussels,  For the European Parliament For the Council  The President The President",,,,,,,"The European Commission has proposed a regulation to establish Union support for asylum, migration, and integration from 2028 to 2034, aiming to address migration as a collective challenge within the European Union. This proposal builds on the Pact on Migration and Asylum, seeking to create a comprehensive approach to managing asylum, migration, and border control through solidarity and shared responsibility among EU member states. It emphasizes the need for member states to develop efficient national systems, including significant financial investments in integrated case management systems and digitalization efforts, such as the use of artificial intelligence, to improve efficiency. The proposal also highlights the importance of supporting personnel needs, like case workers and legal advisers, to ensure the system functions effectively across the EU.

To address evolving challenges in migration and asylum, the proposal introduces mechanisms for flexible and performance-oriented management of Union support, aligning with policy priorities and adapting to new developments. It complements other EU funds aimed at economic and social cohesion and seeks to support legal migration, early integration of third-country nationals, and innovative solutions for migration management. The proposal is part of a broader legal framework that includes regulations for the Schengen area, European integrated border management, and internal security, ensuring coherence and complementarity with existing EU policies.

The proposal underscores the importance of consistency with other Union policies, such as border management, internal security, and the social inclusion and integration of third-country nationals. It also highlights the role of decentralized agencies like Frontex and Europol. Financial assistance for activities related"

a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  establishing the 'AgoraEU' programme for the period 2028-2034, and repealing Regulations (EU) 2021/692 and (EU) 2021/818  {SEC(2025) 547 final} - {SWD(2025) 550 final} - {SWD(2025) 551 final}  EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM  1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  The EU is a community of values ingrained in Europe's history and identity and anchored in the EU Treaty. As set out in Article 2 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU), these are common to all Member States and encompass democracy, respect for human rights, non-discrimination, equality, the rule of law, and pluralism, with cultural diversity, freedom of expression, including media and artistic freedom and pluralism, also being enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU.  Citizens’ participation and engagement, transparency and accountability in decision-making, as well as respect for fundamental rights and the rule of law contribute to the vitality of European democracy. Media plays a crucial role in fostering public opinion and free debate. Audiovisual content and all other forms of artistic, cultural and creative expressions, including cultural heritage, are essential to Europe’s diversity and to forging societal resilience and mutual understanding. Beyond their intrinsic value and social impact, they are powerful drivers of sustainable economic growth and competitiveness, innovation and employment, and soft power, making them essential to Europe’s future.  The importance of an EU financial intervention in these areas lies in their ability to foster inclusive and participatory governance, facilitate informed and active citizenship, safeguard and promote fundamental rights, promote equality and non-discrimination, and celebrate cultural diversity and all types of artistic expressions. Europe’s thriving creative and media sectors, its audiovisual industry and the richness of its cultures and heritage are central to its identity. However, these policy areas face serious challenges that require a holistic Union response.  Union values are the object of internal and external pressures, such as challenges to the rule of law, inequalities, discrimination, violations of fundamental rights, declining trust in democratic institutions as well as weakened confidence in democratic processes. Structural inequalities persist as well as violence and discrimination on the grounds of sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation, often shown in racism and other forms of intolerance. Meanwhile, the traditional role of independent civil society organisations in counterbalancing these trends is challenged by a weakening of financial and political support.  The European media industries are a beacon of quality and creativity, but today they compete with global online platforms for the attention of citizens and consumers. Circulation of EU audiovisual content continues to be fragmented along national lines, and non-EU players capture most of the box office and streaming subscriptions. While the video game industry has gained a strong foothold in contemporary digital culture (more than half of the EU population regularly plays video games), the Union’s video game market continues to be largely dominated by global competitors. Finally, the integrity of the information space is at risk through the spread of disinformation and the growth of foreign information manipulation and interference by hostile actors, such as Russia. Threats against media pluralism are compounded by phenomena such as concentration of media ownership. In parallel, news media experience declining advertising revenues and sales, as digital competitors have captured an increasing share of revenue and shaped consumption habits. As a result of all these factors, media viability is under pressure.  Culture and the cultural and creative sectors and industries in the Union are fragmented as well along national and linguistic lines, reflecting our rich diversity. This limits transnational artistic collaboration, audience reach, the development of innovative practices, as well as the sectors’ resilience and potential for competitiveness, and strengthening societal wellbeing. Culture and creative sectors’ professionals struggle to work across borders and to access new opportunities and markets, which exacerbates geographical imbalances and reduces the circulation of European cultural works. The limited cross-border mobility and cooperation hinders networking, economies of scale, pooling expertise, and co-creation, all that is crucial for sustaining careers and strong culture and creative sectors. Meanwhile, Europe’s rich cultural heritage faces threats from a combination of budgetary constraints, vulnerability to pollution, climate change and natural disasters, as well as misappropriation or destruction.  Finally, societal, creative, cultural and media sectors experience common technological dependencies and could benefit from common activities. They are impacted by financial weaknesses, obstacles to accessing finance, difficulties in using and uptaking applied innovation, lack of adaptation to new sets of skills and digital transformation. Meanwhile, non-EU tech giants increasingly influence the civic, media, and cultural landscape, shaping content consumption through algorithmic recommendations, automated distribution and AI-generated content.  These are challenges of a transnational nature that cannot be effectively addressed without joint EU-level solutions, coordination, steering and support. EU actions can help enable cooperation, capacity building, and mutual learning, as well as optimise and combine the potential of these sectors to contribute to economic growth, societal development and cultural diversity.  EU support to address challenges affecting culture, media, and equality, citizens, rights and Union values has been provided through different funding programmes over the years. In the 2021-2027 Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), support to culture, the cultural and creative sectors and the audiovisual industries was addressed by Creative Europe, with the objectives of safeguarding, developing and promoting European cultural and linguistic diversity and heritage and contributing to the competitiveness of these sectors, notably the audiovisual sector. Meanwhile, the promotion and protection of rights and Union values as enshrined in the Treaties, the Charter and the applicable international human rights convention were primarily the object of the Citizens, Equality, Rights and Values (CERV) programme. CERV has supported civil society organisations working at European, national, regional and local levels, including grassroots, in their work to protect and promote Union values. The Union support in some areas, such as news media and countering disinformation, was fragmented across different programmes. The cross - sectoral strand of Cre ative Europe included specific actions on media pluralism, literacy, and media collaborations, while the Multimedia actions line supported the provision of information on EU topics. Tackling disinformation has so far been funded through Digital Europe.  The 2028-2034 MFF proposal aims at addressing ‘complexities, weaknesses and rigidities’ currently present in the EU’s budget, and provides a framework that is more focused, simpler, with fewer and more impactful programmes. For this reason, and to increase the budget’s flexibility and ability to respond to changing realities and emerging problems, this proposal seeks to streamline the EU intervention in the areas of culture, media and equality, citizens, rights and values, exploiting connections and synergies where relevant, while respecting the singularity and specific needs of each of these policy areas.  In the area of equality, citizens, rights and values, the proposal will contribute to upholding democracy and the rule of law, fundamental rights and equality, reducing discrimination and empowering civil society. The new Programme will contribute as well to fighting against gender-based violence, violence against children and other groups at risk. In addition, it will contribute to enhancing democratic resilience and participation.  Media is a driver of democratic values, cultural diversity and economic growth. The media sector encompasses inter alia content such as films, series, video games, news and information, immersive reality and multimedia, as well as services including theatrical exhibition, television and radio broadcasting, print and online publishing, online videos and podcasts. To be socially relevant, the audiovisual and media industries need to be resilient and competitive. The proposal will support a free, competitive and diverse media and audiovisual space. It will on one hand enhance the production, circulation, IP exploitation and consumption of audiovisual works and other forms of media content, such as gaming. On the other hand, it will contribute to protecting the viability and pluralism of the information market, notably by supporting news media and media independence including at regional and local levels. It will also contribute to tackling disinformation and foreign information manipulation and interference.  Culture and the cultural and creative sectors are great assets for Europe, projecting the image of a dynamic continent on the world stage. Encompassing inter alia performing arts, literature and book publishing, music and visual arts, tangible and intangible cultural heritage, architecture, archives, libraries and museums, artistic crafts and design, they produce meanings on various mediums and through multiple formats. The EU intervention in the field of culture will contribute to increasing cross-border cultural creation and cooperation, cultural participation and accessibility to a diversity of European cultural expressions and to protecting and preserving cultural heritage. The proposal will also help increase the circulation of a diversity of cultural works and the mobility of professionals, as well as promote inclusiveness and intergenerational fairness through culture. Finally, it will strengthen the social, economic and external dimensions of the cultural and creative sectors.  Finally, the EU should promote synergies among the media, culture, and civic spheres, bringing together public and private entities as well as promoting cross-sectoral cooperation, and innovation, to address common challenges and contribute to societal resilience and democratic participation.  On this basis, the EU financing intervention will be best equipped to enhance and scale up existing successful schemes, to better address transnational challenges, and to fill gaps impossible to address at Member States level. It will also provide wider coherence and better alignment between regulatory policy and funding instruments, as well as between internal and external policies. Therefore, the proposal will contribute to reinforcing Europe’s societies, media and culture, and foster Union values and democratic participation and help unlock the full potential of the Union as a source of progress, sustainable development and growth.  The policy areas covered by this legal proposal are firmly anchored in the EU Treaties, which provide the legal bases for EU action through Union funding programmes, and they contribute to the Union’s long-term objectives. The proposal provides for a date of application as of 1 January 2028.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  Fundamental rights, EU values and democracy  The proposal is fully in line with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, and all relevant EU policy and legislative frameworks in the field of equality and non-discrimination. It also contributes to the Union of Equality strategy. A core ambition of the European Union is to ensure, through a multi stakeholder and intersectoral approach, that all people, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation, age, religion or belief, can live free from discrimination and participate fully in society.  The European Union’s commitment to equality is anchored in numerous key communications and action plans. The European Commission’s 2020 Strategy for the Equality of LGBTIQ People and the 2021 Gender Equality Strategy underscore the EU’s dedication to tackling discrimination and promoting equality across all aspects of society. Both strategies will be renewed, as the current ones end in 2025. These are complemented by the upcoming EU Anti-Racism Strategy 2026-2030, the EU Roma Strategic Framework for Equality, Inclusion and Participation (2020–2030), the Strategy for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2021–2030), and the EU Strategy on the Rights of the Child, the EU Strategy on combating antisemitism and fostering Jewish life (2021-2030) and the work strand on combatting anti-Muslim hatred. The upcoming Intergenerational Fairness Strategy is also of relevance in this context.  The first EU comprehensive framework on democracy has been developed through the 2020 European Democracy Action Plan, the 2021 package of measures to reinforce democracy and protect the integrity of elections and the 2023 Defence of Democracy Package in synergy with the External Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy 2020-2027. The most recent legislation in this context includes the Regulation on transparency of political advertising, and the EU law protecting persons who engage in public participation from manifestly unfounded claims or abusive court proceedings ('strategic lawsuits against public participation').  The upcoming European Democracy Shield will seek to further protect and strengthen democracy and democratic resilience. It will seek to address the increasing threats to democratic institutions, systems and processes within the EU and to enhance citizens’ trust and participation in democracy. The upcoming EU Civil Society Strategy will seek to further protect and empower civil society, sending a strong signal of recognition to the work carried out by civil society and their contribution to EU policies.  Media and audiovisual  This legal proposal also builds upon the EU media and audiovisual framework, where regulation, funding and policy effectively support each other, thereby facilitating democratic debate, enriching our culture, and driving the digital transformation with competitive EU media players.  It will accompany EU single market policies in the audiovisual and media sectors, and its design will complement and reinforce existing legislative instruments. The Audiovisual Media Services Directive (AVMSD) has laid down a common regulatory framework for audiovisual media services across the EU, including provisions such as the promotion of European and independent works, protection of minors, and regulation of audiovisual advertising. Together with AVMSD, the proposed Programme will strengthen the capacity of European audiovisual players to finance, produce and disseminate works that can be sufficiently visible on the different media available and are attractive to audiences in an increasingly open and competitive market within Europe and beyond.  The recently adopted European Media Freedom Act (EMFA) provides safeguards for media freedom and pluralism, including protections against political interference, enhanced transparency of media ownership, and obligations on the independence of public service media. The proposed Programme will complement EMFA by providing financial support to news media outlets and strengthening editorial independence.  It will also build on the Code of conduct on countering hate speech online, the 2018 Action Plan against disinformation , and the Code of Conduct on Disinformation recently integrated within the co-regulatory framework of the Digital Services Act (DSA) , by enhancing media literacy and reinforcing situation awareness on the online information space across Member States.  Culture  Concerning culture, cultural heritage and the cultural and creative sectors, the initiative will accompany the upcoming Culture Compass for Europe , which is intended as a strategic policy approach aiming to embed culture and the CCS in the Union’s overarching policy goals and to guide and harness their multiple dimensions.  The initiative builds on several key policy initiatives, including the European Agenda for Culture , the Council’s Work Plans for Culture , the EU Strategy for International Cultural Relations , and the European Framework for Action on Cultural Heritage , which all plea for a stronger role for culture and the CCS in the further social, economic and international development of our Union. It aligns with European initiatives such as the New European Bauhaus , the European Capitals of Culture action and the European Heritage Label action. It is also in line with the Rome Declaration of March 2017, where the Member States and EU institutions envisioned a Union “where citizens have new opportunities for cultural and social development and economic growth [...]; a Union which preserves our cultural heritage and promotes cultural diversity”.  Furthermore, it is consistent with the Commission Communication on Strengthening European Identity through Education and Culture, which states that it is in the shared interest of all Member States “to harness the full potential of education and culture as drivers for jobs, economic growth, social fairness, active citizenship as well as a means to experience European identity in all its diversity”. The initiative is also in line with the 2005 UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions , to which the Union and its Member States are parties.  Finally, the initiative is to be seen in the context of the upcoming EU Strategy on sustainable Tourism, aiming among others to support visitors in discovering lesser-known cultural routes and heritage sites across Europe, thus fostering economic development and promoting local jobs.  • Consistency with other Union policies  The initiative is aligned with the overarching Commission’s 2024-2029 policy priorities, namely in terms of 1) Supporting people, strengthening our societies and our social model; 2) Protecting our democracy, upholding our values; 3) Europe’s sustainable prosperity and competitiveness; and 4) a global Europe.  Consistency with policies supporting people, strengthening our societies and our social model  In the context of the Multiannual Financial Framework (2028-2034), synergies will be fostered between media, culture, equality, rights and values initiatives and the future intervention in the fields of skills, education, social inclusion, solidarity, intergenerational fairness, youth and social and territorial cohesion. These synergies, such as in media literacy, digital skills, civic engagement and civic education and skills development and inclusion through creativity and the arts will be promoted in line with the objectives of the European Youth Strategy and the EU Citizenship Report.  The initiative may also seek synergies and complementarities with future interventions under shared management aimed at strengthening social and territorial cohesion within the EU.  The initiative complements some initiatives promoting the principles of the European Pillar of Social Rights, including through employment and social policies, as well as of the European Child Guarantee. This includes promoting equal access to rights and fostering diversity, including at the regional and local level, as means to support social inclusion and fair labour markets, and to tackle child poverty. As key actors in shaping public discourse and fostering democratic engagement, culture and media are central to building inclusive, resilient societies. In the context of the Union of Skills, the initiative will actively contribute to the upskilling and reskilling of professionals in the cultural and creative industries (CCIs), supporting their adaptability in the face of digital and green transitions and labour market shifts. Furthermore, by reinforcing the competitiveness of cultural and creative sectors, the Programme favours the creation of jobs in these sectors. At the same time, the initiative will enhance capacity-building for civil society organisations (CSOs) working in the field of equality, rights and values.  In light of increasing risks linked to natural hazards, health emergencies, technological accidents, evolving security threats, and other disruptions, this initiative will enhance the resilience of vital societal functions, and build a more resilient, secure, and prepared Union, in line with the objectives of the EU Preparedness Union Strategy .  Consistency with justice policies  The alignment between justice policies and the rule of law creates a robust framework that ensures accountability, promotes legal coherence across and within Member States, and protects fundamental rights, thereby enhancing trust and cooperation within the Union. The relationship between fundamental rights and justice policies is key in shaping fair and equitable societies. Fundamental rights – ranging from the right to a fair trial, freedom from discrimination to the protection of privacy – define the essential standards that justice systems must uphold, and translate abstract principles into concrete legal measures and practices. For instance, anti-discrimination laws enforce the principle of equality before the law.  Thus, the synergy between fundamental rights and justice policies ensures that legal systems not only prevent abuses but also actively promote dignity, equality, and freedom. This synergy is essential for building public trust in legal institutions, fostering social cohesion, and ultimately ensuring that justice is accessible and meaningful for all individuals. To this end, in the context of the Multiannual Financial Framework (2028-2034), synergies will be fostered between this Programme and the future Justice programme.  Consistency with policies for the Single Market and competitiveness  By contributing to the competitiveness of media, audiovisual and the cultural and creative sectors, the initiative will complement the EU policy framework on industrial policy and economic competitiveness. Notably, it builds on the 2024 Single Market and Competitiveness Report, which adopts an ecosystem-based approach to strengthen the resilience and strategic autonomy of key industrial sectors, including cultural and creative industries. It also reflects the objectives of the Competitiveness Compass, which sets out clear benchmarks to improve the EU’s long-term productivity and resilience and promote innovation.  In addition, the initiative relates to the 2020 Commission Communication “An SME Strategy for a sustainable and digital Europe”, which aims to unleash the power of Europe’s SMEs to lead the twin transitions, based on three pillars: capacity-building and support; reducing regulatory burden and improving market access; and improving access to financing. The initiative also contributes to the European Commission’s new Savings and Investments Union Strategy, which aims to enhance financial opportunities for businesses.  Research and innovation are essential to developing inclusive, rights-based cultural, creative, and media systems. The initiative will strengthen synergies with the future Framework Programme for research and innovation and the future European Competitiveness Fund. The latter includes support for multidisciplinary research on a variety of topics, including democracy, values, equality, and disinformation, but also on digital and industrial topics closely linked to the culture and creative sectors and cultural heritage. Synergies and complementarities will need to be strengthened to reinforce the European research ecosystem, so that the cultural and creative sectors and civil society fully benefit from the advances of European research and innovation areas. The Programme will thus contribute to the take-up of the results of research and innovation actions funded under the Research Framework Programme.  Moreover, the proposal contributes to addressing Europe’s digital transformation, in line with the objectives of the Digital Decade 2030. It will complement it by supporting actions that promote digital preparedness, skills development and applied innovation in the societal, culture and media sectors, such as the AI Continent Action Plan and the Apply AI strategy. It will also accompany existing regulation, such as the Digital Services Act, the Digital Markets Act and the AI Act by increasing the audiovisual and media content access, strengthening media literacy, encouraging fair competition and platform-neutral access to audiences. Cross-border collaborations and availability of audiovisual content would also strengthen interoperability of digital products.  Consistency with policies for a global Europe  The proposed Programme will, once adopted, complement actions financed through the Union’s external actions. For instance, by promoting cultural exchanges and supporting Union creative industries, media and audiovisual content globally including through international collaborations, it will open new markets, attract global talent, enhance the EU’s influence and attractiveness on the world stage. The future intervention will include participation of third countries in the Programme and support for international collaborations, allowing for synergies with EU’s policies on external action.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  The proposal is based on Articles 19(2), 21(2), 24, 167(5), 168(5) and 173(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), to achieve the Programme’s general objectives in a comprehensive way.  Article 19(2) TFEU provides for the adoption of incentive measures to support Member State action in combating discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation.  Democratic engagement, civic participation and the fostering of civil society are essential building blocks of the notion of Union citizenship. They constitute crucial factors and facilitators of the right to move and reside freely in the Union.  Article 21(2) TFEU provides for Union measures to facilitate the exercise of citizens’ rights to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States. Actions to inform citizens and authorities about citizens voting rights when residing in another Member State can also be covered by this Article, since in practice they also facilitate the exercise of a citizen’s right to move and reside freely.  Art icle 24 TFEU obliges the European Parliament and the Council to adopt provisions for the procedures and conditions required for a citizens ’ initiative within the meaning of Article 11 TEU. This has been done by adopting Regulation (EU) 2019/788 of the European Parliament and of the Council 1 . The Programme should support the financing of technical and organisational support for the implementation of that Regulation, thereby underpinning the exercise by citizens of the right to launch and support European citizens’ initiatives. Together with the other rights set out in Article 24 TFEU, that right ensures citizens’ direct participation in the democratic life of the Union.  Article 167(5) TFEU tasks the Union to adopt incentive measures to contribute to the flowering of the cultures of the Member States, while respecting their national and regional diversity and by bringing forward the common cultural heritage. The actions by the Union shall encourage co-operation between Member States and supplement their actions in areas such as improvement of the knowledge and dissemination of the culture and history of the European peoples and conservation and safeguarding of cultural heritage of European significance.  Article 168(5) TFEU provides a legal basis for the adoption of incentive measures designed to protect and improve human health. Violence, including against children and women, constitutes a danger to physical and mental health. Children are vulnerable citizens and need an increased level of protection against these dangers, which often include cross border threats. Violence against women also constitutes a serious threat to the physical and mental health of victims, who are in need of a high level of protection.  Article 173(3) TFEU states that the Union may decide on specific measures in support of action taken in the Member States to ensure that the conditions necessary for the competitiveness of the Union's industry exist, including taking action to encourage an environment favourable to initiative and to the development of undertakings.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  The promotion and protection of culture, media and Union values requires transnational cooperation and coordinated efforts that extend beyond national borders. These are areas where the complexity of the challenges makes it difficult for Member States to address them sufficiently on their own. Coordinated action at EU level allows for more coherent and impactful responses to address transnational and common challenges that slow down progress and allow systemic impact through the identification and the resolution of structural gaps not prioritised by Member States. The EU budget plays a key role in enabling these collective responses. Such an approach also ensures greater coherence between internal policies and the Union’s promotion of its values and international standards abroad.  By reason of the scale and effects of the proposed programme, a Union-level action brings added value, as these objectives cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States acting alone. For instance, it strengthens a sense of EU citizenship and mutual understanding by facilitating cross-border activities that foster civic engagement, solidarity, and wider participation in culture and media. It also ensures consistent and high standards across the EU and effective application of rights enshrined in EU law across Member States, which is essential for the protection of EU citizens. Moreover, EU action reinforces the Single Market by promoting fair access and mobility, while enabling more efficient delivery through coordinated frameworks and larger-scale joint projects. By addressing fragmentation, promoting collaboration across Member States and pooling resources at EU level, the initiative ensures that creative industries, audiovisual and media companies and creators can fully benefit from the Single Market. It improves access to diverse cultural and creative content, supports media pluralism, and increases the competitiveness of the European audiovisual industry.  The added value of EU funding in these policy areas was highlighted by a vast majority of respondents to the open public consultation carried out by the Commission for the new EU programmes (see below).  • Proportionality  The proposal complies with the principle of proportionality, in that it does not go beyond the minimum required to achieve the stated objectives at EU level and what is necessary for those purposes.  • Choice of the instrument  The new ‘AgoraEU’ Programme builds primarily on the Creative Europe Programme (2021-2027), the Citizens, Equality, Rights and Values (CERV) Programme (2021-2027) and existing prerogative lines, bringing together EU financial support to sustain culture, media and Union values. The new instrument takes into account the specific features of the different sectors, their different target groups, and particular needs, while ensuring synergies and complementarities.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  The Commission has taken into account the results of the final evaluation of the Creative Europe programme 2014-2020 and interim final evaluation of the Creative Europe programme 2021-2027, as well as the interim evaluation of the CERV programme and the final evaluations of the Europe for Citizens programme and the Rights, Equality and Citizens programmes, which were carried out over the period 2023-2025.  These evaluations assessed the performance of the programmes, based on their effectiveness, efficiency, relevance, coherence, sustainability and EU added value.  The results of these evaluations indicate that the existing programmes have largely delivered on their policy objectives and provided EU added value, while highlighting areas for improvement in terms of design.  The evaluation of Creative Europe underscores the contribution of the Programme to the general objective of supporting cultural and linguistic diversity and cultural heritage by increasing people’s access to a variety of content coming in particular from beyond national borders and to the objective of competitiveness by helping audiovisual and other creative and cultural operators to improve their skills and scale up at European level. It has a unique place as the only source of funding for transnational cooperation, exchange of good practices, circulation and mobility in these sectors.  The interim evaluation of the CERV programme confirmed that the programme occupies an otherwise largely empty space in the values and fundamental rights funding landscape, as the dedicated EU instrument to safeguard and promote fundamental rights, equality and non-discrimination, democracy and the rule of law in Europe. The evaluation also showed the key role played by the programme in supporting civil society organisations working on rights and values, including those at the grassroots level, who would often lack other funding sources and forms of support.  The evaluation of the Multimedia Actions line (2021-2023) confirms that it was effective in strengthening news coverage on EU affairs from a European perspective. The actions supported the production of a high volume of original content, achieving a notable audience reach.  • Stakeholder consultations  A public consultation informed the impact assessment for EU programmes in the domains of cross-border education, youth, culture, media, values and civil society under the post-2027 MFF. It was conducted between 12 February and 7 May 2025. In total, the consultation gathered 5,845 valid replies.  The responses revealed a clear affirmation of the EU’s continued role in fostering cross-border cooperation and supporting culture, media, democracy and fundamental rights. For example, the proportions of respondents finding it ‘very important’ or ‘important’ to ‘protect democracy and democratic standards’, to ‘promote respect of fundamental rights (including children’s and women’s rights)’, to ‘promote media independence and media pluralism, fight against disinformation’ and to ‘promote cultural and creative diversity’ were respectively at 91%, 88%, 85% and 78%.  The responses to the public consultation also confirmed that EU funding provided added value compared to funding at national, local or regional level in the areas it covered. For example, 66% of respondents considered that ‘Protecting democracy and promoting democratic standards’ is an area where EU funding provides significant added value. Nearly two thirds of respondents mentioned support to the audiovisual and media sectors as an “important” policy objective. Finally, approximately 80% of respondents see an added value in EU funding going to ‘Promote cultural and linguistic diversity’ and ‘Promote and preserve cultural heritage and European remembrance’ and 74% to ‘Ensure widespread access to culture and cultural heritage’.  Asked to evaluate the obstacles preventing the EU budget from fully delivering on its objectives in the policy areas, respondents generally welcomed the Commission’s focus on greater efficiency in funding, but not at the cost of “identity” and “trust”, preserving thematic clarity and stakeholder ownership.  Quantitative results show that the most frequently cited obstacles across all groups were administrative burden (identified by 51% of citizens and 56% of organisations) and complex, fund-specific compliance rules (49% of citizens and 52% of organisations). These issues reflect concerns not only with regulatory complexity but also with fragmentation between instruments and inefficiencies in delivery. Additional barriers included lack of flexibility to reallocate resources in response to emerging needs (45% of citizens and 50% of organisations), delays in programme implementation and funding disbursement, and insufficient communication or clarity about funding opportunities. Public authorities and NGOs in particular emphasised delays as a source of reduced impact and local credibility.  • Collection and use of expertise  The proposal has been informed by external reports and assessments.  The proposal has been informed by a wealth of studies and reports, such as from the European Parliament, the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights and the European Institute for Gender Equality, which point towards the growing and serious challenges testing fundamental rights and values in the EU as well as the resilience of our democratic institutions 2 .  In the field of media and audiovisual, it has relied on the conclusions of the 2023 European Media Industry Outlook 3 , which provided valuable insights into the structural challenges of the media and audiovisual industries (incl. gaming). M edia companies in the EU are under increasing pressure from global competitors for users’ attention and revenue. Consumer spending and media consumption have stagnated since the COVID-19 pandemic , with digital platforms aggregating more content and capturing more ad revenue than traditional media. T he sectors also struggle with high technology adoption costs, limited private investment, and heavy dependence on non-EU technologies. In addition, the report revealed that, in the EU, the circulation of audiovisual work s across borders is limited, hindering the industry’s potential. Meanwhile, the viability of news media is increasingly at risk, with declining revenues, shrinking employment, and limited consumer trust.  In the field of culture and creative sectors, the proposal has been informed by thematic meetings, findings of independent studies, Council conclusions 4 , re solutions from the European Parliament 5 , the evaluation of the European Heritage Label action 6 and the first interim evaluation of the European Capital of Culture action for the year 2020-2033 7 , as well as recommendations made by experts from Member States in the context of the Open Method of Coordination on culture 8 . These various sources underline the persisting relevance of the Culture strand of Creative Europe while pointing at areas of improvement, in particular in connection with the d igital and green transition s and the surge of AI, working conditions of artists and cultural and creative professionals, as well as the international context.  • Impact assessment  This proposal was subject to an impact assessment. Commission services have explored several alternative policy options to address the challenges of the sectors concerned and determined which option served better the policy areas and the priorities of the Commission. The various options were mutually exclusive. One option was to continue the existing Creative Europe and CERV programmes as stand-alone programmes, while introducing some incremental improvements. A second option consisted of bringing together the programmes aimed at protecting Union values, media and culture. A third option was a full integration under a single instrument of policies covered today by CERV, Creative Europe, together with those covered by Erasmus+ and European Solidarity Corps (ESC).  Other alternatives were also considered yet discarded at an early stage. One was the discontinuation of the EU funding in the fields currently covered by CERV and Creative Europe, but it was rejected given the importance of the problems affecting the sectors concerned, the prominence given to these policies in the Political Guidelines and the assessment of the continued relevance and added value of the EU funding intervention, underpinned by the respective mid-term evaluations. The option of alternative merging of programmes (e.g. only the Media strand of Creative Europe with the CERV programme) was also abandoned at an early stage, as it would not have effectively aligned with political priorities or adequately catered for the challenges of the sectors concerned.  The main potential impacts of the three shortlisted options (continuity, full integration, and objective-based merger) were analysed across various social, economic and environmental dimensions. Where relevant, the analysis also covered costs and benefits, impacts on competitiveness and SMEs and on digitalisation, as well as their contribution to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). The three policy options were assessed based on their effectiveness, efficiency, coherence and proportionality, applying the Social Multi-Criteria Evaluation (SMCE).  The evaluation of the options and their impacts highlighted that an integration based on policy objectives (objective-based merger) would offer better potential compared to the two alternatives. It would allow for reinforced coordination, targeted flexibility, and a more impactful use of the EU budget – without sacrificing policy focus or accessibility. It would offer the optimal balance between simplification and policy relevance. It is also congruent with stakeholders’ calls, who ask for the simplification of access to funding, flexibility of resource allocation and the application of common rules. In line with the Political Guidelines, it follows a ‘funding-follows-policy’ principle, bringing together programmes aiming at protecting culture, media and Union values. It will build on the success of current programmes, best practices of the current MFF, as evidenced by evaluations, better addressing transnational and common challenges, filling funding gaps at Member States level, and enhancing coherence between internal and external policies, while enhancing synergies, efficiency and effectiveness, and reducing overlaps. It will pay due visibility to each of the policy areas included in the merged programme in full respect of the horizontal provisions detailed in Regulation (EU, Euratom) [202X/XXX, Performance Regulation] applicable to all Union programmes. It will also increase action on cross-cutting priorities and synergies affecting the societal, media and cultural and creative sectors (e.g. sectoral skills, access to finance, innovation uptake, etc.).  Based on the Better Regulation guidelines, this impact assessment report was submitted for quality scrutiny to the Regulatory Scrutiny Board (RSB). The RSB gave an opinion on the impact assessment on 13 June 2025. The RSB made a series of comments and recommendations on scope, problem definition and the use of evaluations, intervention logic and objectives, comparison of options and cost-benefit analysis, governance, coherence and future monitoring and evaluation. The impact assessment accompanying this legal proposal was reviewed in accordance with the Board’s comments.  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  The initiative will streamline EU management, governance and implementation of EU programmes to improve efficiency for applicants, beneficiaries and EU institutions. Application and reporting procedures will be simplified and further harmonised, through the introduction of common or aligned rules, making it easier for applicants to apply to calls addressing complementary policy objectives.  To simplify implementation and reduce administrative burden for beneficiaries, the use of simplified forms of funding (including financing not linked to costs and lump sums) will become the standard form of contribution for reimbursing grants. The use of financial support to third parties, which has proven efficient in making EU funding more accessible to small organisations, will also continue and could be extended where appropriate. Moreover, increasing the use of multi-annual grants will also have a positive impact. Obstacles encountered by grassroots organisations and first-time applicants will be addressed through targeted simplification measures addressing their circumstances, enhanced communication, and promotion of funding opportunities. The pooling of resources, including in areas such as monitoring, internal and external communication will bring economies of scale and enhance the predictability of EU funding more widely among beneficiaries, stakeholders and EU citizens.  • Fundamental rights  Building on the previous Creative Europe and Citizens, Equality, Rights and Values (CERV) programmes and pre-existing prerogative lines, the new instrument aims at promoting Union values, including respect for fundamental rights, equality, democracy, as well as culture and media.  It is in line with and promotes the values set out in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union. The objectives of the new Programme are closely linked to the promotion of fundamental rights and are thus in line with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU. In particular, this proposal will contribute to the promotion and protection of the rights and principles enshrined in Articles 8 (protection of personal data), 11 (freedom of expression, right s to information, media freedom and pluralism), 12 (freedom of assembly and of association), 13 (freedom of the arts and science), 15 (freedom to choose an occupation and right to engage in work), 20 and 21 (equality and non-discrimination), 22 (cultural and linguistic diversity), 23 (equality between women and men), 24 (rights of the child), 26 (rights of persons with disabilities), 31 (fair and just working conditions), 32 (prohibition of child labour and protection of young people at work), 33 (family and professional life), 39 to 46 (citizens’ rights) of the Charter.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  see Annex  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  This initiative will be monitored through the performance framework for the 2028-2034 budget defined in Regulation (EU) [XXX]* of the European Parliament and of the Council [Performance], which also details the specific rules regarding evaluations. The evaluation shall be conducted in accordance with the Commission's Better Regulation Guidelines and will be based on indicators relevant to the objectives of the Programme.  A part of the Programme will be implemented by an Executive Agency under the supervision of the Commission services responsible for the Programme.  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  The general objectives of the Programme are to promote cultural and linguistic diversity and heritage, to increase the competitiveness of the cultural and creative sectors, in particular the media and audiovisual industries, to safeguard artistic and media freedom, and to protect and promote equality, active citizenship, rights and values as enshrined in the Treaties and in the Charter, thereby enhancing democratic participation and societal resilience within the Union.  Within this general objective, the Programme shall have three separate strands:  First, the ‘Creative Europe – Culture’ strand, which will implement the following specific objective:  (a) Contribute to cross-border cultural creation, cooperation, participation and accessibility, and cross-border circulation of a diversity of cultural works, while strengthening the social, economic and international dimensions of the cultural and creative sectors .  Second, the ‘MEDIA+’ strand, which will implement the following specific objectives:  (a) Contribute to the cultural diversity and competitiveness of the audiovisual and video games industries, notably by enhancing creation and cross-border distribution of European content and its access by citizens .  (b) Contribute to a free, viable and diverse Union information ecosystem, notably by supporting free and independent journalism and news media, enhancing citizens’ access to trustworthy information and tackling disinformation .  Third, the Democracy, Citizens, Equality, Rights and Values (‘CERV+’) strand, which will implement the following specific objectives:  (a) Contribute to protecting and promoting fundamental rights, equality and non-discrimination and Union citizen s ’ rights enshrined in the Treaties including free movement of citizens, and empower ing civil society .  (b) Contribute to fighting against gender-based violence, violence against children and other groups at risk of such violence .  (c) Contribute to enhancing democratic participation and upholding the rule of law .  To maximise impact and enhance synergies across the strands, the Programme shall support cross-cutting and horizontal activities contributing to the general objective, notably by developing synergies between the cultural, media and civic spheres and promoting cross-sectoral collaboration and innovation .  To be effective, the Programme should take into account the specific nature of the different policies, their different target groups and their particular needs through targeted approaches.  2025/0550 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  establishing the 'AgoraEU' programme for the period 2028-2034, and repealing Regulations (EU) 2021/692 and (EU) 2021/818  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article s 19(2), 21(2), 24, 167(5), 168(5) and 173(3) thereof ,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 9 ,  Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions 10 ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure  Whereas:  (1) Pursuant to Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU), the Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and the respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities, which are common to the Member States in a society in which pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail (‘Union values’) . The Union values are reflected in the rights, freedoms and principles set out in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the ‘Charter’). Article 3 TEU further mandates the Union to promote the protection of the rights of the child. Article 10 TEU further states that the functioning of the Union shall be founded on representative democracy, that citizens are directly represented at Union level in the European Parliament and that citizens have the right to participate in the democratic life of the Union. Article 20 establishes Union citizenship and sets out important rights that c itizens of the Union shall , inter alia, enjoy .  (2) Culture and media and promotion and respect of Union values are all crucial components of a free, fair, diverse, inclusive and cohesive Union. Citizens’ participation and engagement, in due respect of Union values, constitutes the basis of the democratic life of the Union, with media playing a crucial role in shaping public opinion and free debate. Audiovisual works and all other forms of cultural and creative expressions, including cultural heritage, are essential to Europe’s diversity and to forg ing societal resilience and mutual understandin g among European citizens and communities .  (3) The ‘ Agora EU ’ Programme (the ‘Programme’) will provide a significant contribution to the attainment and realisation of these objectives, rights and values.  (4) The Programme should succeed the Creative Europe Programme established by Regulation (EU) 2021/818 of the European Parliament and the Council 11 and the Citizens, Equality, Rights and Values Programme, established by Regulation (EU) 2021/692 of the European Parliament and of the Council 12 . It should streamline various funding actions in support of media freedom and pluralism, fight against disinformation in support of the provision on information on Union affairs. Free and pluralistic media and civil society are among key watchdogs of the Union’s democratic systems, playing a crucial role for democratic resilience, and should be supported. The Programme should also support the cultural, creative and media sectors, harness the power of culture and cultural diversity, enhance the information space, and support the Union’s efforts to strengthen a rights-based, inclusive, equal and democratic society. This Regulation lays down an indicative financial envelope for the ‘ Agora EU ’ Programme 13 . For the purpose of this Regulation, current prices are calculated by applying a fixed 2% deflator.  (5) To be effective, the Programme should take into account the specific nature and challenges of the different policy areas and sectors , their different target groups and their particular needs through targeted approaches.  (6) In a fast changing economic, social and geopolitical environment, the recent experience has shown the need for a more flexible multiannual financial framework and its programmes. To that effect, and in line with the objectives of the ‘ Agora EU ’ Programme, the funding will take due account of the evolving policy needs and Union’s priorities as identified in relevant documents published by the Commission, in Council conclusions and European Parliament resolutions while ensuring sufficient predictability for the implementatio n .  (7) The cultural and creative sectors , including performing arts (such as theatre and dance), literature and book publishing, music, visual arts, tangible and intangible cultural heritage, architecture, archives, libraries and museums, crafts and design (including fashion design), serve as ‘ public good ’ , generating meaning and embodying the values of the Union . They are also a great asset for the Union and its regions , attracting sustainable tourism and projecting the image of a dynamic continent on the world stage. The Programme should take into account , on the one hand, their intrinsic and artistic value , as well as , on the other hand, their extrinsic social and economic contributions, including to social and territorial cohesion, well-being and health, growth and job creation , competitiveness , creativity and innovation.  (8) The cultur al and creative sectors are however fragmented along national and linguistic lines in the Union . They also face multiple challenges, such as attacks on freedom of artistic expression, precarious working conditions, digital transformations with the rise of artificial intelligence, and the need to adapt to climate change. The Programme should help th ose sectors respond to such challenges, untap their full potential and project themselves resolutely into the future while ensuring the widest participation , including from local and regional actors , through various channels and formats .  (9) Europe's cultural heritage is a shared and priceless legacy facing budget constraints, natural and human-induced disasters, climate change, and regional conflicts. It is important to safeguard and preserve such a legacy, enhancing access and fostering a collective European identity. Digital preservation further ensures that future generations can learn from, appreciate, and draw inspiration from their cultural heritage.  (10) The Programme should also give financial support to the European Heritage Label and the European Capitals of Culture actions, that celebrate and preserve Europe's rich cultural diversity and heritage , connecting it to the local level and contribut ing to culture-driven development strategies.  (11) Europe's media sectors hold a unique position in our democracies, culture, and economies. They encompass, inter alia, content such as films, series, video games, news and information, immersive reality and multimedia, as well as services including theatrical exhibition, television and radio broadcasting, print and online publishing, advertising online videos and podcasts. The digital transformation, notably the rise of artificial intelligence, has accelerated media convergence, changed consumer behaviour, disrupted business and revenue models, as well as intellectual property management and exploitation. The Union should therefore help the Union’s media thrive, foster innovation and access to finance, promot e cross fertilisation between news, audi o visual and other media sectors and support collaborations between different types of media entities a cross the Union.  (12) The Union audiovisual sector face s challenges stemming from limited cross-border circulation, shifting consumption habits and the dominance of non- Union players. Given these challenges, Union intervention should support the capacity of European audiovisual and video games industries to create, finance, produce and disseminate European works on all platforms that are available and attractive to audiences within the Union and beyond. It should foster transmedia adaptations of intellectual property between different media formats, contribute to promoting collaboration among Member States with different market capacities, and accompany the Union’s audiovisual regulatory framework.  (13) News media outlets and journalists across the Union are under increased pressure , notably due to the rise of global online platforms, shifting consumption habits and growing spread of disinformation . These challenges impact news revenues and distribution, undermining the viability and public trust in news media outlets, and limiting citizens’ access to diverse, professionally produced European journalistic content. The Union should support a viable, independent and diverse information ecosystem, protect journalists under threat, promote media freedom and pluralism, and reinforce the integrity of the information space, by promoting measures and enhancing cooperation aimed at tackling disinformation and supporting digital and media literacy , including for young people .  (14) Democracies in the Union are facing increasing challenges. Declining trust of citizens in democratic institutions and processes is exacerbated by disinformation, social polarisation and hatred impacting the electoral and other democratic processes. A whole of society approach is needed to make European democracy more resilient .  (15) The protection and promotion of fundamental rights contributes to the construction of a more democratic Union. Non-discrimination is a core principle of the Union enshrined in Article 19 TFEU and in Article 21 of the Charter . Working towards an equal and discrimination-free society contributes to untap ping the potential of individuals in their diversity and to cultural, economic and social growth. It also helps to address important root causes of violence against vulnerable groups , which in turn is a frontal attack on equality . The refore, the Programme should promote actions to address all forms of discrimination and intolerance, namely direct and indirect discrimination, paying attention to the specific forms of structural and intersectional discrimination, with a view to support ing relevant Union policy frameworks. The Programme should support actions to prevent and combat all forms of xenophobia and racism, antisemitism and anti- M uslim hatred, homophobia, biphobia, transphobia, interphobia , intolerance and discrimination based on gender identity, intolerance towards persons belonging to minorities including Roma, as well as hate speech. The Programme should also contribute to enabl ing the Union to deliver on the commitment taken as Party to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities adopted on 13 December 2006 14 to promote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities.  (16) The rights to privacy and the protection of personal data, enshrined respectively in Article 7 of the Charter and in Article 16 TFEU and Article 8 of the Charter, are enforced through a dedicated Regulation 15 and Directive 16 . The Union ’ s legal framework lay s down provisions to ensure that the right to protection of personal data is effectively protected. These legal instruments entrust the national data protection supervisory authorities with the task of promoting public awareness and understanding the risks, rules, safeguards and rights in relation to the processing of personal data. The Programme should contribute to rais ing awareness, carry out studies and other relevant activities in this field , including through the national data protection supervisory authorities , given the importance of the right to the protection of personal data in times of rapid technological developments.  (17) Gender equality is a fundamental right and an objective of the Union and should be supported by the P rogramme. Despite many achievements, significant challenges remain, which require to reinforce the Union’s commitment. This include s working towards freedom from gender-based violence, the highest standards of health, including in particular sexual and reproductive health, equal pay and economic empowerment, work-life balance and care, equal employment, career opportunities and working conditions, quality and inclusive education, political participation and equal representation, institutional mechanisms that deliver on women’s rights, actively tackling gender stereotypes and addressing intersectional discrimination.  (18) Gender-based violence and violence against women, children, young persons and other groups at risk, such as LGBTIQ persons and persons with disabilities, constitute a serious violation of fundamental rights and continue to persist throughout the Union, in all social and economic contexts. Violence against women and persons belonging to other groups at risk is a violation of human rights and a frontal attack on equality . Thus, preventing and addressing such violence is a societal imperative and contributes to tackling such discrimination as well as addressing the impacts of violence, including on health. At the same time, ensuring a discrimination-free society will also help address the root causes of violence against vulnerable groups , since they are intrinsically linked. The refore , the Programme should continue the longstanding Union effort in preventing, responding to and fighting violence at all levels as well as in protecting and supporting all direct and indirect victims and survivors of violence, building on the five consecutive generations of the Daphne programme and strand 17 . The Programme should support the achievement of the objectives of the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women adopted in Istanbul on 11 May 2011 , the implementation of the Commission Recommendation on developing and strengthening integrated child protection systems in the best interests of the child 18 , which protects children from any form of violence , as well as contribute to enabl ing the Union to deliver on the commitment taken as Party to the U N Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities , which protect s persons with disabilities against any form of exploitation, violence and abuse .  (19) In accordance with Union a c quis on equal treatment, the Member States have set up independent bodies for the promotion of equal treatment (‘equality bodies’), which play a key role in promoting equality and ensuring the effective application of equal treatment legislation. Further, the Programme should support t he European Network of Equality Bodies (Equinet) composed of the national equality bodies as provided for by Council Directive (EU) 2024/1499 19 and Directive (EU) 2024/1500 of the European Parliament and of the Council 20 , s ince Equinet is the only entity which ensures coordination of activities between equality bodies . This is of key importance for the effective implementation of Union anti-discrimination law in the Member States.  (20) Citizens throughout the Union, many of whom regularly or at least occasionally travel to, live, study, work or volunteer in another Member State, should feel able to enjoy and exercise their citizenship rights and to place their trust in equal access, full enforceability and protection of their rights without any discrimination, no matter where in the Union they happen to be. Citizens should be more aware of their rights deriving from citizenship of the Union, namely their right to move and reside freely in the Union, their voting rights when residing in another Member State , their right to petition the European Parliament in any of the official languages, their right to submit citizens' initiatives and their right to lodge complaints with the European o mbudsman against institutional maladministration.  (21) Encouraging citizens to play a more active role in democracy at Union level will strengthen European civil society and foster the development of a European identity. Civil society therefore needs to be supported in promoting, safeguarding and raising awareness of Union values and in contributing to the effective enjoyment of rights under Union law. When Union citizens participate in the democratic life of the Union, they contribute to making a reality representative democracy, a principle on which the functioning of the Union is founded and which gives concrete expression to the value of democracy enshrined in Article 2 TEU.  (22) In order to bring the Union closer to its citizens and to foster democratic participation, a variety of actions and coordinated efforts are necessary. European citizenship and European identity should be developed and advanced by encouraging citizens’ understanding of the policy-making process, and by promoting civic engagement in the actions of the Union. Remembrance activities and critical reflection on Europe’s historical memory are necessary to make citizens aware of the common history, and to lay the foundation for a common future and shared values. Furthermore, supporting civil society organisations at local, regional, national and transnational level in the areas covered by the Programme will contribute to increasing citizens’ engagement in society and ultimately to their active involvement in the democratic life of the Union. At the same time, supporting activities that promote mutual understanding, intercultural dialogue, cultural and linguistic diversity, social inclusion and respect for others fosters a sense of belonging to the Union and of a common citizenship under a European identity, based on a shared understanding of our common European values, culture, history and heritage.  (23) C ivil society organisations , and other civic space actors, such as independent h uman r ights bodies, e quality b odies and Ombudspersons Institutions, play a vital role in contributing to the implementation of policy, encouraging people’s participation, holding institutions accountable, and driving positive change. The Programme should help ensure sufficient resources and an enabling environment for them to operate independently, freely , safely, and effectively. To this end, Union funding should complement efforts at national level by supporting, protecting, empowering and building their capacity, as emphasi s ed in the European Parliament resolution of 19 April 2018 21 , as well as Council conclusions of 10 March 2023 22 and 7 March 2025 23 . Civil society also plays an important role in ensuring an effective implementation of Directive (EU) 2019/1937 of the European Parliament and of the Council 24 by fostering a speak-up culture and a favourable environment for whistleblowers.  (24) The Court of Justice of the European Union has confirmed that the Union is a legal structure that is based on the fundamental premis e that each Member State shares with all the other Member States, and recognises that they share with it, the common values contained in Article 2 TEU, on which the Union is founded 25 . That premis e is based on the specific and essential characteristics of Union law, including the autonomy it enjoys in relation to the laws of the Member States and to international law. That premis e implies and justifies the existence of mutual trust between the Member States that those values will be recognised and, therefore, that the Union law that implements them will be respected . It follows that compliance by a Member State with the values contained in Article 2 TEU is a condition for the enjoyment of all the rights deriving from the application of the Treaties to that Member State . The Court of Justice of the European Union has therefore confirmed that in the areas for which the Union is competent, it can take action to ensure respect for the values set out in Article 2 TEU .  (25) At a time when European societies face challenges that affect democracies , such as raise of extremisms and intolerance , disinformation and foreign information manipulation and interference by hostile actors, it is crucial that Union values such as respect for fundamental rights , equality and democracy, continue to be actively cultivated, protected, promoted, enforced, and shared among citizens and peoples, so that those values remain at the heart of the Union project. A deterioration in their protection in any Member State can have detrimental effects on the Union as a whole. It is therefore crucial that this Programme contributes to protecting Union values, including respect for fundamental rights, equality and democracy.  (26) In light of increasing risks linked to natural hazards, climate and environmental disasters, health emergencies, technological accidents, evolving security threats, and other disruptions, it is essential to enhance the Union’s and Member States’ capability to anticipate, prepare for, and respond to crises . The Programme should therefore support citizens’ education and engagement on crisis preparedness thus enhancing societal resilience .  (27) Hence, the Programme should also support actions aiming at safeguarding and strengthening democracy in the Union, reinforcing public trust in democracy and democratic institutions, strengthening democratic preparedness and resilience, fostering citizens’ engagement, participation and awareness of common history and values, thereby supporting citizens’ exercise of their rights, including their electoral rights, in full respect of Member States’ competences in the organisation of elections. The Programme should also contribute to foster ing critical thinking, civic participation and democracy through education as a lifelong effort, so that all citizens have the skills to recognise foreign information, manipulation and interference and disinformation .  (28) The Programme should foster synergies and complementarity with Global Europe as it will contribute to the advancement of the Union’s international cultural relations and to the Union ’s external action objectives through cultural cooperation .  (29) The Programme should also support the financing of technical and organisational support for the implementation of Regulation (EU)2019/788 of the European Parliament and of the Council 26 , thereby underpinning the exercise by citizens of the right to launch and support European citizens’ initiatives. Together with the other rights set out in Article 24 TFEU, that right ensures citizens’ direct participation in the democratic life of the Union .  (30) To ensure consistency, the budgetary guarantee and financial instruments under the Programme, including when combined with other forms of non-repayable support in blending operations, should be implemented in accordance with the applicable rules of the European Competitiveness Fund ( ECF) InvestEU Instrument through agreements concluded for that type of support under the ECF Invest EU Instrument.  (31) Where Union support under the Programme is to be provided in the form of a budgetary guarantee or a financial instrument, including where combined with non-repayable support in a blending operation, it is necessary that such support is provided exclusively through the ECF InvestEU Instrument in accordance with the applicable rules of the ECF InvestEU Instrument.  (32) The Commission should be able to divide budgetary commitments into annual instalments. In that case, the Commission should commit the annual instalments during the implementation of the Programme, taking into account the progress of the actions that receive financial assistance, their estimated needs and the budget available.  (33) Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 of the European Parliament and of the Council 27 applies to the Programme. It lays down the rules on the establishment and the implementation of the general budget of the Union, including the rules on grants, prizes, non-financial donations, procurement, indirect implementation, financial assistance, financial instruments and budgetary guarantees.  (34) In accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509, Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council 28 , Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2988/95 29 , Council Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 30 and Council Regulation (EU) 2017/1939 31 , the financial interests of the Union are to be protected through proportionate measures, including the prevention, detection, correction and investigation of irregularities and fraud, the recovery of funds lost, wrongly paid or incorrectly used and, where appropriate, the imposition of administrative sanctions. In particular, in accordance with Regulations (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 and (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96, the European Anti-Fraud Office (‘OLAF’) may carry out investigations, including on-the-spot checks and inspections, with a view to establishing whether there has been fraud, corruption or any other illegal activity affecting the financial interests of the Union. In accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017/1939, the European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO) may investigate and prosecute fraud and other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Union as provided for in Directive (EU) 2017/1371 of the European Parliament and of the Council 32 . In accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509, any person or entity receiving Union funds is to fully cooperate in the protection of the Union’s financial interests, to grant the necessary rights and access to the Commission, OLAF, EPPO and the European Court of Auditors and to ensure that any third parties involved in the implementation of Union funds grant equivalent rights.  (35) The Programme is to be implemented in accordance with Regulation (EU) [XXX]* of the European Parliament and of the Council [Performance] which establishes the rules for the expenditure tracking and the performance framework for the budget, including rules for ensuring a uniform application of the principles of ‘do no significant harm’ and gender equality referred to in Article 33(2), points (d) and (f), of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 respectively, rules for monitoring and reporting on the performance of Union programmes and activities, rules for establishing a Union funding portal, rules for the evaluation of the programmes, as well as other horizontal provisions applicable to all Union programmes such as those on information, communication and visibility , while taking into account the scope and nature of the activities and priorities .  (36) The Programme should also support the role of Programme Desks, which Member States have the possibility to establish, and which should provid e guidance and assistance to applicants on funding opportunities and cross-border collaborations, contributing to the Programme’s outreach visibility and dissemination in accordance with Regulation (EU) [XXX]* of the European Parliament and of the Council [Performance] . Programme Desks should carry out their functions independently and without interference from public authorities in their decision making, and ought not to have any responsibility regarding the management of the programme 33 .  (37) Pursuant to Article 85(1) of Council Decision (EU) 2021/1764 34 , persons and entities established in overseas countries and territories are eligible for funding subject to the ruled objectives of the Programme and possible arrangements applicable to the Member State to which the relevant overseas country or territory is linked.  (38) Participation of third countries in the ‘Audiovisual’ specific objective requires a certain level of reciprocity and regulatory alignment. For this reason, the situation of their audiovisual markets, the proximity of their legal frameworks with the Union audiovisual media acquis, in particular Directive 2010/13/EU, and the access to their support schemes should be taken into consideration when concluding Association Agreements. This is of particular importance concerning other European countries, whose audiovisual works benefit from the provisions of Directive 2010/13/EU that promote European works, notably the quotas system. In the specific case of acceding countries, candidate countries and potential candidates, the requirement to align their national legislations with Directive 2010/13/EU was already included in Regulation (EU) 2021/818 establishing the Creative Europe Programme. This condition has been an efficient incentive to accelerate their work on the overall alignment with the EU acquis in view of accession.  (39) Since the objectives of this Regulation cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the transnational nature of the challenges, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, as set out in Article 5 TEU . In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.  (40) This Regulation establishes the Programme for 2028 to 2034, which succeeds to the Programmes established by Regulations (EU) 2021/692 and (EU) 2021/818 for 2021 to 2027. Regulations (EU) 2021/692 and (EU) 2021/818 should therefore be repealed ,  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Chapter I  General provisions  Article 1  Subject matter  This Regulation establishes the ‘AgoraEU’ Programme (the ‘Programme’) and lays down the objectives of the Programme, its budget for the period 2028-2034, the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding.

Chapter VI  Financial provisions  Article 11  Budget  1. The indicative financial envelope for the implementation of the Programme for the period 2028-203 4 is set at EUR 8 582 000 000 in current prices.  2. Budgetary commitments for activities extending over more than one financial year may be broken down over several years into annual instalments.  3. Appropriations may be entered in the Union budget beyond 2034 to cover the expenses necessary and to enable the management of actions not completed by the end of the Programme.  4. The financial envelope referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article and the amounts of additional resources referred to in Article 1 2 may also be used for technical and administrative assistance for the implementation of the Programme, such as preparatory, monitoring, control, audit and evaluation activities, corporate information technology systems and platforms, information and communication activities, including corporate communication on the political priorities of the Union, and all other technical and administrative assistance or staff-related expenses incurred by the Commission for the management of the Programme.  Article 12  Additional resources  1. Member States, Union institutions, bodies and agencies, third countries, international organisations, international financial institutions, or other third parties, may make additional financial or non-financial contributions to the Programme. Additional financial contributions shall constitute external assigned revenue within the meaning of Article 21(2), points (a), (d), or (e), or Article 21(5) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509.  2. Resources allocated to Member States under shared management may, at their request, be made available to the Programme. The Commission shall implement those resources directly or indirectly in accordance with Article 62(1), point (a) or (c), of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509. They shall be additional to the amount referred to in Article 11 (1) of this Regulation. Those resources shall be used for the benefit of the Member State concerned. Where the Commission has not entered into a legal commitment under direct or indirect management for additional amounts thus made available to the Programme, the corresponding uncommitted amounts may, at the request of the Member State concerned, be transferred back to one or more respective source programmes or their successors.  Article 13  Alternative, combined and cumulative funding  1. The Programme shall be implemented in synergy with other Union programmes. An action that has received Union contribution from another programme may also receive a contribution under this Programme. The rules of the relevant Union programme shall apply to the corresponding contribution, or a single set of rules may be applied to all contributions and a single legal commitment may be concluded. If all Union contributions are provided based on eligible cost, the cumulative support from the Union budget shall not exceed the total eligible costs of the action and may be calculated on a pro-rata basis in accordance with the documents setting out the conditions for support.  2.

FRAMEWORK OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE  1.1. Title of the proposal/initiative  Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council establishing the ‘AgoraEU’ Programme and repealing regulations (EU) No 2021/692 and No 2021/818 for the period 2028-2034  1.2. Policy area(s) concerned  Culture, audiovisual and media, fundamental rights, equality and non-discrimination, the rule of law, civil society, democratic participation.  1.3. Objective(s)  1.3.1. General objective(s)  The general objectives of the Programme are to promote cultural and linguistic diversity and heritage, to increase the competitiveness of the cultural and creative sectors, in particular the media and audiovisual industries, to safeguard artistic and media freedom, and to protect and promote equality, active citizenship, rights and values as enshrined in the Treaties and in the Charter, thereby enhancing democratic participation and societal resilience within the Union.  1.3.2. Specific objective(s)  The Programme will underpin the following specific objectives:  a) contribute to cross-border cultural creation, cooperation, participation and accessibility, and cross-border circulation of a diversity of cultural works, while strengthening the social, economic and international dimensions of the cultural and creative sectors (‘culture’);  b) contribute to the cultural diversity and competitiveness of the audiovisual and video games industries, notably by enhancing creation and cross-border distribution of European content and its access by citizens (‘audiovisual’);  c) contribute to a free, viable and diverse Union information ecosystem, notably by supporting free and independent journalism and news media, enhancing citizens’ access to trustworthy information and tackling disinformation (‘news’);  d) contribute to protecting and promoting fundamental rights, equality and non-discrimination and Union citizen’s rights enshrined in the Treaties including free movement of citizens, and empowering civil society (‘rights, equality, citizens and civil society’).  e) contribute to fighting against gender-based violence, violence against children and other groups at risk of such violence (‘Daphne’).  f) contribute to enhancing democratic participation and upholding the rule of law (‘democratic participation and rule of law’).  To maximise impact and enhance synergies, the Programme shall support cross-cutting and horizontal activities contributing to the general objectives, notably by developing synergies between the cultural, media and civic spheres and promoting cross-sectoral collaboration and innovation.  1.3.3. Expected result(s) and impact  Specify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.  The Programme will have positive impact on cross-border cultural cooperation, cultural participation and accessibility, and circulation of diverse cultural works. This will come through promotion of cooperation, creation, networking and pooling of experience in the cultural and creative sectors (CCS), support of circulation of diverse cultural content and access to cultural diversity and heritage, and support of mobility of artists and CCS professionals beyond national borders. Actions will result in, among others, better equipped CCS to address key challenges, reinforced CCS creative potential in respect of artistic freedom, a more diverse cultural content circulating beyond national borders, more artists and CCS professionals expanding their careers, increased and more inclusive access to more diverse cultural content and heritage, increased international cultural partnerships and exchanges, increased digitisation, access, preservation and reuse of digital heritage.  The Programme will have positive impact on supporting the creation, circulation and access of EU audiovisual and media content, and a diverse information market. Support to audiovisual works will contribute to strengthening European cultural diversity and competitiveness, through e.g. co-productions. It will bring improvements as well in the creation, circulation and access to video games content, and foster cross-media IP exploitation. The integrity of the EU information market will be protected through support to media pluralism and independence, media viability and media literacy, and by strengthening situational awareness.  The Programme will have positive impact on the protection and promotion of fundamental rights and non-discrimination, as well as on a thriving civic space. Actions will have the effect to increase the visibility and awareness of fundamental rights, reduce discrimination and harassment. Actions will also have the effect to protect individuals, and particularly women, children and groups at risk from violence and to support victims in addressing its consequences. Citizens and organisations will be able to participate meaningfully in the political, economic, social and cultural life of their societies. Citizens will be able to freely express their views, choose their political leaders, and have a say about their future.  1.3.4. Indicators of performance  Specify the indicators for monitoring progress and achievements.  The output and result indicators for the purpose of monitoring progress and achievements of this programme will correspond to the common indicators provided under Regulation (EU) [XXX]* of the European Parliament and of the Council [Performance].  1.4. The proposal/initiative relates to:  ¨ a new action  ¨ a new action following a pilot project / preparatory action 38  ☒ the extension of an existing action  ¨ a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action  1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative  1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative  The Programme will contribute to tackling specific and common challenges and fostering synergies in the culture, media, and civic spheres while taking into account the specific nature and challenges of the different policy areas, their different target groups and their particular needs. By bringing together support in these areas, the Union will be better equipped to address recurrent but also new and emerging policy priorities, such as protecting democracies, rights and equality, fostering an enabling space for civil society, contributing to cultural and linguistic diversity and to the protection of cultural heritage, strengthening the cultural and creative sectors and increasing their resilience, promoting media freedom and pluralism, and enhancing the economic growth of the media and cultural players.  1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, great er effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this section 'added value of EU involvement' is the value resulting from EU action, that is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.  Reasons for action at EU level (ex-ante)  Funding covered by the programme concentrates on activities where the EU intervention can bring additional value compared to action of Member States alone.  In particular:  - Addressing transnational and common challenges (e.g., shrinking civic spaces, threats to media freedom and pluralism, fragmentation of the cultural, creative and media sectors along national and linguistic borders): these challenges makes it difficult for Member States to address them sufficiently on their own. EU level efforts enable cooperation, capacity building, mutual learning and the pooling of resources, sharing of expertise and best practices.  - National-level funding and policies alone are insufficient to protect and promote EU values and democratic standards, and to safeguard the civic space. This also applies to the overall competitiveness and diversity of the media, audiovisual and other cultural and creative sectors.  - EU support is essential to maintain access to audiovisual and cultural content across all Member States and a high level of protection of fundamental rights.  - EU support fill funding and service gaps not covered at Member State level.  - EU action is critical to promote Union values at international level, implementing international standards coherently with internal policies.  Expected generated  EU added value (ex-post)  - EU-level action will enable transnational cooperation, pooling of resources, and exchange of best practices across Member States, leading to more coherent and impactful responses to shared challenges.  - EU support will complement national measures by supporting areas underfunded or deprioritized nationally.  - EU action will enhance mobility of professionals and circulation, reinforcing the functioning of the internal market and cultural and linguistic diversity.  - EU-level actions will raise awareness of rights and nurture a sense of EU citizenship and mutual understanding, through the greater awareness and appreciation of cultural diversity, the protection and promotion of Union values, supporting democratic and societal resilience, and a trustworthy information space, objectives that national interventions alone cannot fully achieve.  - EU support will foster cross border access to media, audiovisual and other cultural and creative content to European citizens.  1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past  The results of the mid-term evaluations for the period 2021-2027 indicate that the existing programmes have largely delivered on their policy objectives and provided EU added value, while highlighting areas for improvement in terms of design. For example, the interim evaluation of the Citizens, Equality, Rights and Values (CERV) programme confirmed that the programme occupies a largely empty space in the values and fundamental rights funding landscape. Creative Europe has contributed to support cultural and linguistic diversity by increasing people’s access to diverse European content as well as to help audiovisual and other creative and cultural operators to scale up at European level and become more competitive. The evaluation on Multimedia Actions equally confirmed the added value of supporting independent news coverage on EU affairs.  The evaluations also point to areas of improvement in terms of design. These include expanding the reach of the programmes, easing access, simplifying management, enhancing monitoring, strengthening synergies and avoiding overlaps with other programmes, and increasing flexibility to address new challenges.  1.5.4. Compatibility with the multiannual financial framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments  The initiative is part of the 2028-2034 multiannual financial framework proposal.  The initiative is aligned with the overarching Commission’s 2024-2029 policy priorities, namely in terms of 1) Supporting people, strengthening our societies and our social model; 2) Protecting our democracy, upholding our values; 3) Europe’s sustainable prosperity and competitiveness; and 4) a global Europe.  1) Synergies with policies supporting people, strengthening our societies and our social model  Synergies will be fostered between media, culture, values and rights initiatives and the future intervention in the fields of education, solidarity and youth. These synergies, such as in media literacy, digital skills, civic engagement and civic education, arts and culture education, and skills development and inclusion, will be promoted in line with the objectives of the European Youth Strategy and the EU Citizenship Report as well as other upcoming policy initiatives. The initiative complements some initiatives under employment and social policies. Promoting equal access to rights and fostering diversity will support social inclusion and fair labour markets. The cultural and creative sectors and media industries will actively contribute to the upskilling and reskilling of professionals, in the context of the Union of Skills, likewise, it will likely favour the creation of jobs in these sectors. The cultural and creative sectors will also focus on improving working conditions of artists and of cultural and creative professionals.  2) Synergies with justice policies  The alignment between justice policies and the rule of law creates a robust framework that ensures accountability, promotes legal coherence across Member States, and protects fundamental rights, thereby enhancing trust and cooperation within the Union. The relationship between fundamental rights and justice policies is key in shaping fair and equitable societies. Fundamental rights – ranging from the right to a fair trial, freedom from discrimination to the protection of privacy – define the essential standards that justice systems must uphold, and translate abstract principles into concrete legal measures and practices. For instance, anti-discrimination laws enforce the principle of equality before the law. Thus, the synergy between fundamental rights and justice policies ensures that legal systems not only prevent abuses but actively promote dignity, equality, and freedom. This synergy is essential for building public trust in legal institutions, fostering social cohesion, and ultimately ensuring that justice is accessible and meaningful for all individuals. To this end, synergies will be fostered between this programme and the future Justice programme.  3) Synergies with policies for the Single Market and competitiveness  The initiative will complement the EU policy framework on Single Market and economic competitiveness. Notably, it builds on the 2024 Single Market and Competitiveness Report, which adopts an ecosystem-based approach to strengthen the resilience and strategic autonomy of key industrial sectors, including cultural and creative industries. It also reflects the objectives of the Competitiveness Compass, which sets out clear benchmarks to improve the EU’s long-term productivity and promote innovation.  The initiative will strengthen synergies with the future European Competitiveness Fund and the future programme for research and innovation. This includes support for multidisciplinary research in a variety of topics including democracy, values, equality, and disinformation, but also on digital and industrial topics closely linked to the cultural and creative sectors (e.g., extended reality, immersive environments, new media). Moreover, the proposal contributes to addressing Europe’s digital transformation, in line with the objectives of the Digital Decade 2030.  4) Synergies with policies for a global Europe  The future programme will complement actions financed through the Union external actions. For instance, by promoting cultural exchanges and supporting EU media and audiovisual content globally including through   international collaborations, it will open new markets, attract global talent, enhance the EU’s influence and attractiveness on the world stage.  1.5.5.

Comments  The programme will be implemented under direct management (with parts delegated to the European Education and Culture Executive Agency) as well as under indirect management through International organisations (e.g. UNESCO, OECD, CoE,...) and other Pillar assessed bodies, which has proven to be successful in previous Multiannual Financial Frameworks (MFFs).  2. MANAGEMENT MEASURES  2.1. Monitoring and reporting rules  (41) The monitoring and reporting rules for this programme will follow the requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) [XXX]* of the European Parliament and of the Council [ Pe rformance] .  2.2. Management and control system(s)  2.2.1. Justification of the budget implementation method(s), the funding implementation mechanism(s), the payment modalities and the control strategy proposed  The majority of the Programme's actions will be implemented under direct management mode, and partly delegated to the European Education and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA). The current implementing mode has proven effective in the precedessor programmes, and the error rates are currently less than 2% for the Creative Europe programme, based on preliminary results for the current MFF. Funding will be implemented using the implementation modes offered by the Financial Regulation, mainly grants and procurement, as this allows to better adapt the actions to the needs of the policy and to have more flexibility to re-adjust priorities in particular through grants. Grants will be in the form of actual costs, lump sums, flat rates, unit costs or a combination of these. The use of scales of units costs and other simplified measures will reduce the scope for error in cost claims. Several measures to allow better access for example for smaller organisations, simplification of guidelines and procedures on the basis of the Financial Regulation will be applied (see above).  Direct management by the Commission will also allow to establish direct contacts with the beneficiaries/contractors engaged in the implementation of activities that serve Union policies.  2.2.2. Information concerning the risks identified and the internal control system(s) set up to mitigate them  The Programme faces the same risks as other Commission programmes that target beneficiaries which are diverse in nature. In particular, some beneficiaries are not recurring or do not have extensive administrative structures. Risks are mainly related to (1) ensuring quality of selected projects and their subsequent technical implementation; (2) risk of inefficient or non-economic use of funds awarded, both for grants and procurement; (3) fraud.  Most of these risks are expected to be reduced thanks to: (1) careful design of calls for proposals; (2) guidance to applicants and beneficiaries; (3) the use of the simplified cost options of unit costs, flat rates and lump sums, which have been effectively applied in the current MFF and are provided in the Financial Regulation; (4) the use of corporate procedures and systems for the management of proposals and grants (e.g. grants vademecum, e-Grants etc.) to ensure a full alignment with best practice in all stages of the grant and procurement lifecycles.  The control strategy is composed of different building blocks: (1) programming, evaluation and selection of proposals to ensure that only best proposals are funded; (2) signing and monitoring of grant agreements, subject to ex ante verification at both financial and policy level; (3) ex post audits based on a “detection strategy” aimed at identifying a maximum of anomalies in view of recovering undue payments.  Parts of the Programme will continue to be implemented by the Education and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA) which uses the same corporate procedures applied throughout the Commission.  EACEA applies an annual ex post audit plan which covers all actions, and confirms an error rate below 2% for the current MFF.  Currently, EACEA is supervised by its Steering Committee with DG EAC and DG CNECT as the parent DGs regarding the Creative Europe programme as well as DG JUST as parent DG for the CERV programme. Regular reporting via dashboards is ensured as well as regular coordination meetings with the parent DGs.  2.2.3. Estimation and justification of the cost-effectiveness of the controls (ratio between the control costs  and the value of the related funds managed), and assessment of the expected levels of risk of error (at payment & at closure)  The cost of controls of the programme amounts to approximately 6% of the payments done by the Commission. This is expected to stay stable or slightly decrease if the use of simplified cost options is further expanded. The objective for the management and control system is to maintain the expected levels of risk of error (at payment and at closure) below the materiality threshold of 2%.  2.3. Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities  The responsible services will continue to apply their Anti-Fraud Strategy – that are in line with the Commission’s Anti-Fraud Strategy (CAFS) – to ensure inter alia that their internal anti-fraud related controls are fully aligned with the CAFS and that its fraud risk management approach is geared to identify fraud risk cases and adequate responses.  Anti-fraud strategies of both EACEA and the Commission  enable fraud risk to be addressed, mainly via measures to prevent irregularity which are then escalated in the event of fraud detection. The following measures will continue to be implemented, both at the parent DGs as in EACEA: Desk monitoring, monitoring missions in accordance with a defined monitoring strategy, clear reporting requirements in the grant agreements with beneficiaries, kick-off meetings with new beneficiaries, possibility to cut grants upon non-delivery of results or non-compliance with certain funding conditions such as those linked to communication.  Beneficiaries in exclusion cases are submitted to the Early Detection and Exclusion Database (EDES) and cases are followed up with OLAF and the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO).  3.

This comprehensive programme seeks to establish a supportive framework that emphasizes inclusive governance, the promotion of fundamental rights, and the celebration of cultural diversity. Recognizing the pivotal role of media and cultural expressions in shaping public opinion, fostering societal resilience, and driving economic growth, the programme addresses significant challenges such as threats to media pluralism, declining revenues for news media, and the dominance of non-EU players in the audiovisual and video game markets. It also tackles the fragmentation of cultural and creative sectors along national lines, which hinders transnational collaboration and limits market access.

To support these objectives, the programme will introduce new budget lines within the multiannual financial framework, specifically targeting areas such as Creative Europe - Culture, MEDIA+, and CERV+ (Citizens, Equality, Rights and Values). These budget lines will see commitments increasing annually from 2028 to 2034, with a total of 8.582 billion EUR allocated for commitments over the seven-year period. The programme also includes support expenditure for AgoraEU, although specific payment figures are yet to be determined.

In addition to operational appropriations, the programme outlines administrative expenditures, including human resources and other administrative costs, totaling 270.478 million EUR over the same period. These expenditures are essential for the effective implementation and management of the"

The communication ‘The road to the next multiannual financial framework’ 1 , sets the main priorities and principles of EU external action under the EU budget, which aims to be simpler, more focused, more flexible, with a greater impact and to deliver on EU priorities.  The international landscape has changed significantly over the last years, appearing far less predictable and stable. The impact of the current geopolitical instability on the EU and on partner countries is increasing, notably following Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, the conflicts in the Middle East, the US administration’s disengagement from external aid, the increasing risk of pandemics, the trade tensions, and the technology competition. These challenges, along with the widening gap to reach the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030, require the EU to adapt its external action financing to better serve its strategic interests and address current and future crises.  The objective of the proposed Instrument, Global Europe, is to uphold and promote the Union’s values, principles and interests worldwide to pursue the objectives and principles of the Union’s external action, as laid down in Article 3(5), Articles 8 and 21 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). Global Europe will contribute to the objectives of the EU’s external action, by promoting mutually beneficial partnerships with partner countries, contributing simultaneously to the sustainable development of partner countries and to the Union’s strategic interests. Global Europe will also allow the Union to be better positioned to address global challenges.  The proposed Instrument is based on four main guiding principles, which are further detailed in the different sections of this document.  – Simplification of the architecture of the external heading, through one main instrument for EU external action and with a horizontal P erformance R egulation 2 for the entire MFF, covering monitoring, reporting, evaluation and communication.  – Coherence of action, with increased geographisation , more focus on coherence, consistency and complementarity between internal and external programmes, as well as a stronger Team Europe approach.  – Flexibility of the instrument, preserving some of the flexibilities of NDICI-Global Europe including its general reserve (the cushion), financial flexibilities and the possibility to adopt delegated acts, and increasing them through the reduction of targets and easier budgetary transfers between and within pillars , as well as budgetary flexibilities among MFFs (below more details on architecture and on flexibilities).  – Impact of EU action, with a strengthened toolbox allowing to build comprehensive packages; with a streamlined and more efficient guarantee and blending framework, and a stronger promotion of European interests.  To further simplify, increase coherence and ensure the effectiveness of the Union's external action, Global Europe serves a wide range of policies, namely the enlargement, neighbourhood, international partnerships and humanitarian aid policies, maintaining the specificities of each policy, fostered through a broad array of tools. Through this proposal the EU will continue to deliver on the objectives of pre-accession, to engage with partner countries, including in complex settings and to provide humanitarian assistance. The proposed instrument will also provide increased economic and trade opportunities to the mutual benefit of the Union and partner countries, support sustainable development, promote human rights, gender equality and EU multilateral engagement, fight the root causes of irregular migration, forced displacement, instability climate change, and protect the environment. The general objectives of the Instrument are detailed in Article 4 of the proposed Regulation and the specific objectives are specified and detailed in Annex II.  Building on the experience of the NDICI-Global Europe that superseded eleven former Regulations, in line with the priorities set out in the communication ‘The road to the next multiannual financial framework’ and as concluded in the impact assessment accompanying this Regulation, Global Europe incorporates and builds on:  – The Regulations (EU) 2021/947 establishing Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation – Global Europe ( NDICI-Global Europe ), amending and repealing Decision No 466/2014/EU and repealing Regulation (EU) 2017/1601 and Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 480/2009;  – The Regulation (EU) 2021/1529 establishing the Instrument for Pre-Accession assistance ( IPA III );  – The Regulation (EU) 2024/792 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 February 2024 establishing the Ukraine Facility ;  – The Regulation (EU) 2024/1449 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 May 2024 on establishing the Reform and Growth Facility for the Western Balkans ;  – The Regulation (EU) 2025/535 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 March 2025 establishing the Reform and Growth Facility for the Republic of Moldova .  Given the magnitude and unpredictability of the needs, reconstruction and pre-accession assistance for Ukraine will be financed above the MFF ceilings (the so-called ‘headroom’ of the MFF) and be implemented through Global Europe. Furthermore, humanitarian aid actions will be funded under Global Europe and implemented in line with the Humanitarian A id Regulation 3 . Moreover, macro- financial assistance could be provided to countries experiencing balance of payments crises and will be funded under Global Europe. Global Europe will be the main instrument of the external heading, complemented by the association of the overseas countries and territories with the Union established by Council Decision (EU) 2021/1764 4 as well as the Common Foreign and Security Policy budget. Furthermore, the Instrument will be implemented in accordance with the horizontal P erformance Regulation , as detailed in chapter 5 ‘Other elements’ of this document.  In a global context where the Union is confronted with high geopolitical and geoeconomic competition , marked by global challenges, ranging from climate change to tensions around scarce resources, continuing migratory pressure or economic and trade disruptions, in addition to security threats and fragility, external action has to continuously and rapidly react to emerging needs, as well as to act to advance strategic priorities , in order to effectively pursue the Union’s and partners’ priorities. The Instrument is built to combine the need of predictability with the need to adjust rapidly to an evolving geopolitical context.  Coherence and complementarity of action will be ensured, enhancing the geographisation principle introduced under NDICI-Global Europe. The internal architecture of the proposed Instrument follows this principle and is composed of five geographic pillars and a global pillar , each of which is composed of a programmable and non-programmable component. The Instrument will be implemented primarily through the five geographic programmable components, complemented by the geographic non-programmable components. The global pillar will focus on global initiatives and will be complementary to the geographic pillars. The six pillars are supported by an unallocated emerging challenges and priorities cushion , to increase flexibility as well as the ability of the Union to respond to unforeseen needs and adapt its partnerships to emerging priorities, building on the experience of the European Development Funds and NDICI-Global Europe.  The recent evaluation of the external instruments (2014-2020 and 2021-2027) 5 confirmed that the external financing instruments under the current MFF are largely fit for purpose and delivering against their objectives. Nevertheless, it noted that t he changing geopolitical landscape has also exposed some architectural weaknesses in their design, in particular as regards their flexibility. On NDICI-Global Europe , the evaluation stressed that it could still better contribute to an integrated approach balancing EU interests, partnerships and values, further reconciling the objectives of the EU’s internal and external thematic policies. On IPA III, the above evaluation highlighted that the instrument's flexibility has been limited by the fact that annual planning has, through implementation, prevailed over strategic multi-annual programming . The lessons learned together with the increasing volatile geopolitical context have prompted the Commission to further simplify the architecture of the external financing instruments and provid e more flexibility . The Global Europe proposal also preserve s flexibilities already allowed under NDICI-Global Europe and IPA III, concerning carry-overs of funds Furthermore, reflows generated by financial instruments and surplus of budgetary guarantees will be available to be reused under this Instrument . Other elements enhancing flexibility are the possibility of adopting d elegated acts, already foreseen under NDICI-Global Europe and the easier budgetary transfers between and within pillars under the architecture of Global Europe . Furthermore, the proposed instrument does not include thematic targets. A target on o fficial d evelopment a ssistance spending is present in the Global Europe proposal.  •Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  As mentioned above, the Global Europe proposal serves under one instrument a wide range of policies, namely the enlargement, neighbourhood, international partnerships and humanitarian aid policies, maintaining the specificities of each policy. This proposal provides an enabling framework through which external action policies and international commitments can be implemented. The main international commitments include the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 6 , the Paris Agreement on Climate Change 7 , the Kunming - Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework 8 , the Addis Ababa Action Agenda 9 , the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015-2030) 10 , the Istanbul Convention on violence against women 11 and the Pact for the Future 12 . Within the EU, the policy framework includes the Treaty provisions on external action, association agreements, partnership and cooperation agreements, multilateral agreements to which the Union is a party , and other agreements that establish a legally binding relationship between the Union and partner countries as well as European Council conclusions, Council conclusions, summit declarations or conclusions of meetings with partner countries at the level of heads of state or government or ministers, European Parliament resolutions, communications of the Commission and joint communications with the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.  •Consistency with other Union policies  Consistency and complementarity will be ensured among the Union’s external financing instruments, in particular with Humanitarian aid (funded under Global Europe), the association of the overseas countries and territories with the Union, the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the European Peace Facility (which is financed outside the Union budget), as well as the European Instrument for International Nuclear Safety Cooperation- Decommissioning.  Global Europe will provide support aimed at credibly and effectively preparing candidate countries and potential candidates for future EU membership. The fulfilment of this ambition calls for aligning, to the extent possible, the design of pre-accession support under Global Europe with the orientations of relevant internal programmes.  Funding from Global Europe should also be used to foster the establishment of people-to-people partnerships based on common interests and intergenerational fairness and strengthen skills development, innovation and cultural diversity through cooperation in the fields of education, youth and research, in a way that is consistent with the Erasmus+ Regulation . Furthermore, in this framework, consistency and complementarity will also be ensured with trade and investment, economic cooperation, migration, security and other sectoral cooperation.  In particular, serving the new economic foreign policy and in synergy with the European Competitiveness Fund, the Instrument will enhance the Union’s competitiveness by responding to economic challenges and swiftly seize opportunities to support Union competitiveness, including via the support to the external dimension of Union internal policies. This will harness the potential of mutually beneficial partnerships for sustainable development in the Union and in partner countries alike.  Moreover, it will contribute to boost resilience and promote stability by addressing fragility in a humanitarian-development-peace nexus approach, balance of payment crises as well as post-conflict recovery and reconstruction needs.  2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  •Legal basis  Part Five, Title III, Chapters 1, 2 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, provides the legal framework for cooperation with partner countries.  This proposal is based on Articles 209, 212 and 322 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. It is presented by the Commission in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 294 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  •Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  The EU’s external action financing seeks to cooperate with partner countries, as well as to promote multilateral solutions to global challenges. It enables the EU to defend its interests, to promote its values and standards, to support the objectives of its internal policies, ensure its security and protect its citizens. It should focus more on strengthening the Union’s competitiveness and reducing its dependencies, notably through securing critical supply chains. Moreover, it is in the EU’s own interest to preserve its role of a trusted global player.  The above-menti oned evaluation of the external instruments (2014-2020 and 2021-2027 MFFs) confirmed the added value that the external financing instruments bring to EU’s external relation s, as they provide a more integrated and sizable offer to partner countries, improving their capacity to address shared priorities with the EU and contributing to sustainable development.  As a party to most multilateral processes, the EU can engage with multilateral and regional partners in key policy areas. Compared to its Member States acting separately, the EU, together with Member States, can achieve greater impact by coordinating common positions and speaking with a stronger voice. As a world’s leading proponent and defender of multilateral and rule-based global governance system, the EU has credibility as an honest broker and defender of core international human right instruments. This leverage in multilateral and regional fora also enables the Union to project globally its policies and values, as well as influence the shaping of global norms and regulatory standards. The EU’s financial commitment is an integral part of the overall engagement in several multilateral agreements (e.g. climate and biodiversity).  Through the increased use of budgetary guarantees, financial instruments and blending operations, the EU incentivises and pools together public and private investments, including to the benefit of countries and sectors having difficult access to financial markets, investments promoting economic resilience, and private sector development. EU non-action would widen the SDGs financing investment gap and further deteriorate the situation of fragile countries while weakening the EU as a geopolitical and geoeconomic actor and as global player in multilateral fora.  Finally, the EU triggers collaboration among development financial institutions . Macro-financial assistance provides much needed financing for countries experiencing balance of payments crises, with favourable conditions.  •Proportionality  In line with the principle of proportionality, the proposed Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve its objectives.  •Choice of the instrument  In accordance with Articles 209, 212 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which set out the ordinary legislative procedure to be used to adopt measures for implementing cooperation with partner countries, the proposal takes the form of a Regulation, ensuring its uniform application, binding nature in its entirety and direct applicability. The legislative financial and digital statement enclosed with this proposal shows the budgetary implications and the human and administrative resources required.  3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  •Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  The mid-term evaluation of the external financing instruments under the 2021-2027 MFF concluded that they were largely fit for purpose and on track to delivery against their objectives they were expected to fulfil at the time of their adoption and these objectives continue to be relevant.  NDICI – Global Europe  The mid-term evaluation also noted that in the evolving geopolitical context, NDICI-Global Europe and its enhanced flexibility proved its relevance to pursue EU priorities as well as to provide support to partner countries notably in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine and the migratory pressures. It also enabled the EU to promote its internal policies and priorities in a more coherent manner towards the external world, while it needed to better contribute to an integrated approach balancing EU interests, partnerships and values. In terms of simplification gains, the mid-term evaluation stressed that NDICI-Global Europe provides a unified legal basis for a large share of the EU’s external interventions. By superseding a large number of the instruments of the past MFF, it had brought about a major increase in coherence and complementarity.  The mid-term evaluation mentioned that the various flexibility features in the NDICI-Global Europe had proved their relevance. However, the NDICI-Global Europe cushion had almost been depleted in the first three years of implementation, showing a mismatch between available funds and actual needs. Moreover, NDICI-Global Europe was not designed to support countries at war at the scale needed by Ukraine. Therefore, a new financing instrument, the Ukraine Facility was adopted for period 2024-27, to support Ukraine both in the face of Russia’s war of aggression and on Ukraine’s path towards EU membership. In general terms, the mid-term evaluation concluded that to better exploit windows of opportunity and maximise scope for EU leverage, differentiated response strategies may be required.  IPA III  The mid-term evaluation noted that IPA III had demonstrated its general effectiveness as a pre-accession instrument. The instrument was considered aligned with the new enlargement methodology, with the fundamentals of the EU accession process at the forefront. The mid-term evaluation also emphasised that IPA III had been effective in promoting socio-economic development and leveraging necessary investments under the Economic and Investment Plan, while there was a need to further accelerate convergence with the EU. The mid-term evaluation noted furthermore that while IPA III was designed as a performance-based instrument both in terms of scope and intensity of assistance, balancing the performance assessment with the fair share principle had limited the financial reward to well-performing beneficiaries.  The mid-term evaluation noted that IPA III had been flexible in responding to exceptional external events despite the lack of a similar cushion as in the NDICI-Global Europe instrument. The absence of pre-set country financial envelopes had provided the required flexibility to programme assistance according to urgent and evolving needs.  •Stakeholder consultation  For the mid-term evaluation and the impact assessment for this proposal, the consultation approach involved collecting input from a wide range of stakeholders on the external financing instruments. The open public consultations for both the mid-term evaluation and the impact assessment targeted all types of stakeholders, including citizens. The summary report on the results of the consultation carried out in the framework of the mid-term evaluation has been published on the “Have Your Say” website 13 and it provides an overview of the received contributions. The synopsis report of the open public consultation in view of the impact assessment for Global Europe can be found in Annex 2 of the impact assessment. A targeted consultation was also undertaken for the mid-term evaluation , to gather the views of specific categories of stakeholders. In the context of targeted consultations, EU Member States experts, development agencies of the EU Member States, civil society and local authorities’ networks and platforms, Development Financial Institutions, and the United Nations were consulted through dedicated meetings. The summary of these targeted consultations can be found in the synopsis report of the stakeholder consultation, in annex V of the the mid-term evaluation 14 .  •Collection and use of expertise  The mid-term evaluation report and associated staff working document were largely based on the independent study carried out by external consultants 15 . All five compulsory evaluation criteria (i.e. effectiveness, efficiency, relevance, coherence and the EU added value) were assessed in this study. The evaluation criteria of impact and sustainability were also covered. The evaluation methods used included: (i) a review of documentation and analytical data; (ii) more than 340 interviews(iii) a series of targeted surveys; (iv) targeted consultations and an open public consultation, as explained above. This mix of qualitative and quantitative methods, using both primary and secondary sources of evidence, provided a comprehensive evidence base for the evaluation. This expertise was also used as evidence base for the impact assessment of this proposal, together with the results of the open public consultations as explained above.  • Impact assessment  As regards the impact assessment accompanying this proposal, the Regulatory Scrutiny Board provided on 13 June 2025 its o pinion without qualification , referring to the specific approach related to the MFF process 16 . . Following the Board’s opinion, the impact assessment was revised in order to integrate its recommendations .  The general objective of the impact assessment was to design external financing instruments that effectively advance the EU’s strategic interests while being responsive to fragility and crisis situations. In this respect, the balance between flexibility and predictability was the fundamental policy parameter for the design of possible policy options. The following options were examined in this context:  • Option 1: A fully flexible external financing instrument based exclusively on strategic priorities defined annually, with no multiannual planning. Ukraine-related support for pre-accession and reconstruction needs would be covered above MFF ceilings.  • Option 2: An external financing instrument based on indicative geographic and global envelopes covering programmable and non-programmable funding for multiannual planning, balancing flexibility and predictability. Ukraine - related support for pre-accession and reconstruction needs would be covered above the MFF ceilings.  • Option 3: An external financing instrument based on indicative geographic and global envelopes covering programmable and non-programmable funding for multiannual planning, balancing flexibility and predictability. Pre-accession needs for Ukraine would be covered by this instrument inside MFF ceilings while the reconstruction needs of Ukraine would be covered above the MFF ceilings.  Based on the analysis of impacts and comparison, Option 2 emerged as the preferred choice. The analysis of effectiveness, coherence and efficiency of the three options against the baseline was made by using the specific objectives of the impact assessment. Options 2 stood out due to its flexibility-predictability equilibrium that best supported these objectives, providing credible support to Ukraine in an uncertain context while protecting the external instrument’s ability to deliver on needs and priorities in other geographical areas.  In terms of expected impact, both Options 2 and 3 are more likely than Option 1 to support the promotion of EU strategic interests and the sustainable development of partner countries.  Options 2 and 3 would also likely better address the interlinkages between the different SDGs, balancing the three dimensions of sustainable development (economic, social, and environmental). They enhance coherence between internal and external policies on the one hand and between external policies on the other. The geographisation principle, including the use of regional envelopes under the geographic pillars, facilitates alignment with the EU's strategic goals (e.g. via Global Gateway, Comprehensive Partnerships, Clean Trade and Investment Partnerships, other similar partnerships). This alignment also allows for more coordinated efforts in addressing social, economic and environmental challenges, thus ensuring that policies are mutually reinforcing rather than working in silos or at unintended cross purposes. In this respect, Options 2 and 3 have the capacity to better integrate policy objectives like competitiveness, economic security, resilient value chains, and environmental sustainability, given that these goals are strategically pursued together.  As compared to Option 3, Option 2 would ensure continuity with the Ukraine Facility’s approach, address short, medium and long-term needs comprehensively, and cover the interlinkages between Ukraine’s accession path and post-war reconstruction. Furthermore, Option 2 would allow to strike a balance between providing credible support to Ukraine in an uncertain context while protecting the external instrument’s ability to deliver on needs and priorities in other geographical areas.  Building on these considerations, option 2 has been retained for this proposal.  •Regulatory fitness and simplification  The proposal provides a simplification from the REFIT point of view. Further streamlining a number of instruments within one broad instrument as detailed above will reduce financial and operational barriers that exist under current instruments. Simplification thus contributes to clearer processes and management of resources. In terms of aligning rules, horizontal provisions from the Performance Regulation will provide the new instrument and the other programmes under the MFF with a coherent and harmonised framework and will make it easier for partners and implementing agents to understand.  •Fundamental rights  One of the Treaty-based general objectives of the EU’s external action (Article 3(5) and Articles 8 and 21 TEU) is to support and promote democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights. The Instrument aims to apply a human rights-based approach guided by the principles of ‘ leaving no one behind ’, equality and non-discrimination on any grounds. The rights-based approach encompasses all human rights, whether civil and political or economic, social and cultural in order to integrate human rights principles into all activities supported by EU external action. The support to Human Rights and Democracy, and to Civil Society Organisations, which was mostly channelled through dedicated thematic programmes in NDICI-Global Europe, remains a priority under the Instrument, channelled both through the geographic pillars to maximise impact and through the global pillar for global initiatives.  4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  The European Commission proposes to allocate an indicative financial envelope of EUR 200 309 000 000 (in current prices) to Global Europe for 2028-2034. Additionally, financial resources for Ukraine shall be made available in accordance with Article 6 of Council Regulation [(EU, Euratom) 20XX/XXX * [MFF Regulation]]. The detailed estimated financial impact of this proposal is presented in the legislative financial and digital statement enclosed with this proposal.  5.OTHER ELEMENTS  •Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  The Instrument should be implemented in accordance with the above-mentioned horizontal P erformance R egulation for the entire MFF, which establishes the rules for the expenditure tracking and the performance framework for the budget, including rules for ensuring a uniform application of the principles of ‘ do no significant harm ’ and gender equality referred to in Article 33(2), points (d) and (f) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/ 2509 17 (Financial Regulation) respectively, rules for monitoring and reporting on the performance of Union programmes and activities, rules for establishing a Single Gateway, rules for the evaluation of the programmes, as well as other horizontal provisions applicable to all Union programmes such as those on information, communication and visibility.  •Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  The proposed Instrument (Global Europe) contains derogations from the provisions of the Financial Regulation, which are justified in several recitals, namely:  Recital 37 – on the non-establishment of a provisioning rate for loans to Ukraine under this Instrument.  Recital 64 – on the possibility to reuse Global Europe funds carried-over. Furthermore, the recital refers to the possibility to reuse under Global Europe, reflows generated by financial instruments.  Recital 65 – on the possibility to increase the resources available for Global Europe, by assigning to it the surpluses related to the current and legacy budgetary guarantees and financial assistance in the external action.  Recitals 68 and 69 – on the possibility to provide support in the form of grants in a flexible and timely manner without the need for a call for proposals, including to private sector entities from Member States.  Recital 81 – on the possibility to promote the participation of eligible entities or persons and counterparts from partner countries benefiting from the budgetary guarantee or financial instruments, and to increase the attractiveness for the private sector and maximise the impact of the investments by extending the eligibility for the budgetary guarantee to entities without a public service mission.  TITLE I: GENERAL PROVISIONS  Article 1 (Subject matter) - defines the Instrument created by the Regulation, which is one of the EU programmes for external action.  Article 2 (Definitions) - contains definitions of the basic terminology used in the Regulation.  Article 3 (Scope and structure) - describes the structure of the Instrument, composed of five geographic pillars and one global pillar. It clarifies the internal structure of the pillars, divided in programmable and non-programmable components, detailing the nature of non-programmable actions. The Article also establishes the geographic scope of each pillar and explains the complementarity of the pillars and of the components.  The countries and territories covered under the geographic pillars are listed in Annex I.  Article 4 (Objectives of the Instrument) - sets out the general objectives, applicable to all pillars of the Instrument, as well as the specific objectives detailed in Annex II.  Article 5 (Consistency, coherence, synergies and complementarity) - explains the relationship between this Instrument and all areas of external action, together with its synergy, consistency and complementarity with internal EU programmes.  Article 6 (Budget) - refers to the overall envelope for the Instrument and gives a detailed indicative breakdown by pillar and specifies the sources of support for Ukraine. It also refers to the ‘emerging challenges and priorities cushion’, which may increase the amounts referred to in the Article.  Article 7 (Emerging challenges and priorities cushion) - refers to the purposes of the emerging challenges and priorities cushion. A provision is included to inform the European Parliament and the Council on the use of the emerging challenges and priorities cushion and to take their observations into account.  Article 8 (Policy framework) - refers to the overall policy framework for the implementation of the Instrument. Existing agreements, strategies, conclusions, resolutions and other similar documents determine the policy on which implementation of the Instrument would be based. A provision is included to inform the European Parliament and the Council and have exchanges of views with them.  Article 9 (General principles) - lists the various principles applicable to the whole Instrument, such as focusing on transformational impact, catering for the strategic interests of the Union, keeping the Union’s engagement in extremely fragile and complex settings contexts, as well as promoting democracy, good governance, the rule of law, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, gender equality, women and youth empowerment. The Article also underlines the importance of the development effectiveness principle and of the involvement and dialogue with civil society organisations and local authorities as well as the private sector.  Article 10 (Mainstreaming) – details how the fight against climate change, environment protection and gender equality should be mainstreamed in the implementation of the Instrument.  Article 11 (Team Europe Approach) - sets out the objective, the modalities and the ambition of the Team Europe approach, which aims to further coordinate the actions, and pooling resources for common goals.  Article 12 (Migration and forced displacement) - illustrates the comprehensive approach toward irregular migration, forced displacement and their root causes.  TITLE II – IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INSTRUMENT  Groups chapters related to the implementation of the Instrument, which includes the multiannual programming.  Chapter I — General programming provisions (Articles 13-17) covers the various provisions on multiannual programming, notably the general approach, principles for geographic programmes, the content of programming documents, and the procedure for adopting them.  Chapter II — Action plans, measures and implementing principles (Articles 18-22) illustrate the action plans and measures which can be adopted, and the respective procedures. Article 22 contains provisions on flexibilities.  Chapter III – Implementation toolbox (Article 23 - 28) covers the available tools to deliver against the objectives of the Instrument, notably budgetary guarantees, blending and financial assistance.  TITLE IV–- FINAL PROVISIONS  Title III (Articles 29-35). Article 30 of this Title covers the exercise of the delegation of powers, to amend Article 6(5), Article 24(1), (2) and (3) and Annex II. Article 31 illustrate the additional implementing rules for the Europe pillar. Article 32 sets up the committee, pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 182/2011. That committee is in charge of delivering an opinion on multiannual programming documents and annual work programmes (action plans and measures). The proposal has two annexes, as follows:  - Annex I — List of countries and territories  - Annex II — Specific objectives  2025/0227 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  establishing Global Europe  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 209 and 212, and Article 322(1) thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 18 ,  Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions 19 ,  Having regard to the opinion of the Court of Auditors,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) This Regulation aims at establishing the programme Global Europe (the ‘Instrument’) with a view to upholding and promoting the Union’s values, principles and interests worldwide in order to pursue the objectives and principles of the Union’s external action, as laid down in Article 3(5) and Articles 8 and 21 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU).  (2) In accordance with Article 21 TEU, the Union is to ensure consistency between the different areas of its external action and between these and its other policies, as well as to work for a high degree of cooperation in all fields of international relations. To increase coherence and ensure the effectiveness of the Union ’ s external action, the Instrument should serve a wide range of Union policies, in particular the enlargement, neighbourhood, international partnerships , humanitarian aid policies , and the external aspects of its other policies , fostered through a broad array of tools.  (3) In accordance with Article 9 of Council Decision 2010/427/EU 20 , the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (the ‘High Representative’) , in its capacity of Vice-President of the Commission, shall ensure the overall political coordination of the Union’s external action, ensuring its unity, consistency and effectiveness, in particular through the implementation of the present Instrument .  (4) The implementation of the Instrument should be guided by the Strategic Agendas of the European Council, relevant European Parliament resolutions and the Political Guidelines of the Commission , which set the Union’s vision, strategic orientations and priorities. While leveraging the Union’s power and partnerships, the external action implemented under th e Instrument should protect and promote Union values , strengthen peace and security and bolster preparedness , prosperity and competitiveness of the Union. To advance the Union’s priorities and interests in its external action, the Union should work in partnership with partner countries and international organisations.  (5) The Instrument should contribute to ensuring consistency, coherence, synergies and complementarity between the Union’s internal and external policies and between its external policies in order to simultaneously promote the Union’s fundamental and strategic interests and sustainable development in partner countries and support the achievement of its global commitments .  (6) The main approach for actions financed under the Instrument should be through geographic programmable actions at country, multi-country, regional and trans-regional level, in order to maximise the impact of the Union’s assistance. That approach should be complemented, where relevant, by non-programmable geographic actions, including actions concerning humanitarian aid, macro-financial assistance, addressing crisis, peace and foreign policy needs , and enhancing resilience and competitiveness, as well as global programmable and non-programmable actions.  (7) Geographic programmable actions should frame the Union’s cooperation with partner countries and regions in the medium and long-term to build mutually beneficial partnerships.  (8) While the budget to finance the Union’s humanitarian aid operations should be made available under this Instrument, such operations should be implemented in accordance with the Humanitarian Aid Instrument established by Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/96 21 .  (9) While the budgetary resources to finance the Union’s macro-financial assistance should be made available under this Instrument, such operations should be implemented as per Article 212 and Article 213 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union TFEU.  (10)  (11) Resilience actions should enable the Union to step up its cooperation where needed in light of the volatility of the external context. They should be flexible incl uding in responding to and reinforcing actions addressing fragility , crisis and supporting the humanitarian-development-peace nexus , address post-conflict recovery and reconstruction needs as well as balance of payment crises.  (12) Competitiveness actions should enable the Union to respond to economic challenges and swiftly seize opportunities to support Union competitiveness, including via the support to the external dimension of Union internal policies. Where relevant, they should contribute to building comprehensive mutually beneficial packages with partner countries.  (13) Crisis, peace and foreign policy needs should include actions allowing the Union to respond to exceptional and unforeseen situations or imperative foreign policy interest, including where there is a threat to peace, democracy, law and order , the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms . Th o se actions should be designed for an effective, efficient, integrated and conflict-sensitive Union response to achieve peace, stability and conflict-prevention in situations of urgency, crisis, fragility, hybrid threats, emerging crisis or natural disasters including the security and safety of individuals, in particular those exposed to sexual and gender-based violence , in situations of instability; or threatening to escalate into armed conflict or to severely destabilise the partner country or countries concerned . They should also support innovative initiatives to address foreign policy needs across political, economic and security issues and enable the Union to act where there is a window of opportunity to achieve its objectives, which are difficult to address by other means.  (14) The Instrument should build on the actions previously supported under Regulations of the European Parliament and of the Council (EU) 2021/947 22 , (EU) 2021/1529 23 , (EU) 2024/792 24 , (EU) 2024/1449 25 , (EU) 2025/535 26 .  (15) The Instrument should contribute to the objectives of the Union’s external action, by promoting mutually beneficial partnerships with partner countries, contributing simultaneously to the sustainable development of partner countries and to the Union’s strategic interests. It should allow the Union to be better positioned to address global challenges , including the fight against climate change and biodiversity protection . It should also provide increased ec onomic and trade opportunities to the mutual benefit of the Union and partner countries.  (16) Union action should promote respect for and be rooted in international human rights law, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 10 December 1948 , and in international humanitarian law, and should be guided by the universality and indivisibility of human rights.  (17) Article 49 TEU provides that any European s tate that respects the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law , as well as respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities, and is committed to promoting those values may apply to become a member of the Union. Those values are common to Member States in a society in which pluralism, non- discrimination, tolerance, justice , solidarity , equality between women and men , intergenerational fairness and cultural diversity prevail. The enlargement process is built on established criteria, fair and rigorous conditionality and the principle of own merits. A European s tate which has applied to join the Union can become a member of the Union only when it has been confirmed that it fully meets the accession criteria established at the Copenhagen European Council in June 1993 (the ‘Copenhagen criteria’) and provided that the Union has the capacity to integrate the new member. A firm commitment to ‘fundamentals first’ approach, which requires a strong focus on the rule of law, the fight against organised crime, fundamental rights, the functioning of democratic institutions and public administration reform, as well as on economic criteria, remains essential. Progress depends on each candidate country’s and potential candidate’s implementation of the necessary reforms to align with the Union acquis.  (18) The enlargement policy of the Union is a strategic investment in peace, security, stability and prosperity in Europe and allows the Union to be better positioned to address global challenges. It also provides increased economic and trade opportunities to the mutual benefit of the Union and the aspiring Member States, while ensuring a gradual transformation of the partner countries . The prospect of Union membership has a powerful transformative effect, embedding positive democratic, political, economic and societal change. It is in the common interest of the Union and its partners to advance efforts to reform their political, legal and economic systems with a view to their future Union membership and to support their accession process .  (19) Since the beginning of Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified war of aggression against Ukraine on 24 February 2022, the Union, its Member States and European financial institutions have mobilised unprecedented support for Ukraine’s economic, social and financial resilience. The scale of damage caused to Ukraine requires significant and flexible support to Ukraine to maintain functions of its government, provide public services, as well as to support the recovery, reconstruction and modernisation of the country. The Instrument should provide the framework for assistance for the fast recovery, reconstruction and modernisation of the country, to mobilise investments and enhance access to finance, as well as to facilitate Ukraine’s alignment with Union standards and values on its way to accession to the Union . Ukraine’s path towards accession should be closely intertwined with reconstruction efforts. Support under the Instrument should, to the extent possible, be integrated into international efforts towards a financial architecture for the recovery of Ukraine and be coordinated with relevant donors and international financial institutions to ensure proper coordination and complementarity of support.  (20) In accordance with Article 8(1) TEU, the Union is to develop a special relationship with neighbouring countries, aiming to establish an area of prosperity and good neighbourliness, founded on the values of the Union and characterised by close and peaceful relations based on cooperation.  (21) The Union should conclude mutually beneficial and tailored partnerships focusing on strategic priorities and fostering regional cooperation in the Neighbourhood East, including the Black Sea region and helping mitigate challenges posed by Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine.  (22) The Union should develop a more focused approach to the Middle East, North Africa and the Gulf , taking into account the inter-relations among these regions. It should deepen relations with the Middle East, North Africa and Gulf regions, in line with the respective strategic frameworks and formal agreements, in particular through mutually beneficial and tailored partnership s in areas of mutual interests, respecting the values and principles of the Union.  (23) The Union’s international partnerships aim at developing relations and build partnerships with partner countries, notably to reduce and, in the long term, eradicate poverty in line with the primary objective of the Union’s development cooperation policy set out in Article 208 TFEU. The Union’s international partnerships also contribute to other objectives of the Union’s external action, in particular to the safeguarding of the Union’s values and fundamental interests, to foster the sustainable economic, social and environmental development of partner countries.  (24) The implementation of the Instrument should support the Global Gateway strategy 27 , the Union’s external investment strategy to advance the sustainable development goals together with partner countries. As a main pillar of the Union’s economic foreign policy, it aims at boosting the development of secure and quality infrastructure in partner countries to create sustainable prosperity, decent jobs, thereby strengthening connections between the Union and its partners , while also benefiting the EU strategic and economic interests . This strategy leverage s investments in secure infrastructure with a focus on digitalisation, climate and energy, transport, health, and education and research. It supports countries which seek to enhance their resilience in a sustainable manner, while strengthening partnerships that are important for the Union’s open strategic autonomy. Global Gateway is also a value-based offer that promotes high social, environmental, governance and financial standards, and upholds democracy, the rule of law and human rights .  (25) The Union should engage in contexts experiencing extremely high levels of fragility, conflict areas, and other complex settings, supporting them through a differentiated approach to address the root causes of fragility while providing access to basic services and promoting the resilience of populations, along the h umanitarian- d evelopment- p eace nexus.  (26) The Instrument should contribute to preserving peace, preventing conflicts and strengthening international security . In line with the P rotect EU Strategy 28 , the Instrument should contribute to a coherent and comprehensive approach to security t o enhance the Union ’s security .  (27) The I nstrument should strengthen democratic resilience in partner countries , including by countering foreign information manipulation and interference, empowering free and pluralistic media, promoting citizens’ engagement, ensuring the fairness and integrity of electoral and other democratic processes, and by engaging in public diplomacy activities.  (28) In accordance with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 adopted at the Third UN World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction on 18 March 2015 29 , recognition should be given to the need to move away from crisis response and containment to a more structural, long-term approach that more effectively addresses situations of fragility, natural and man-made disasters, and protracted crises. Greater emphasis and collective approaches are required on risk reduction, disaster risk management, early warning, prevention, mitigation and preparedness, and further efforts are required to enhance swift response and a durable recovery. This instrument should support reforms and investments that strengthen disaster risk and crisis management, invest in climate resilience, and enhance the resilience of vital societal functions . The Instrument should therefore contribute to strengthening the humanitarian-development-peace nexus.  (29) Since the objectives of this Regulation cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 TEU. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.  (30) The Instrument should contribute to the collective Union objective of providing 0.7 % of g ross n ational i ncome as o fficial d evelopment a ssistance (‘ODA’) , established by the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD, within the timeframe of the 2030 Agenda adopted by the United Nations in September 2015 30 (the ‘2030 Agenda’ ) , by supporting realistic and verifiable actions to meet this commitment, on which progress should continue to be monitored and reported. It should also promote mutually beneficial partnerships for sustainable development, including through the mobilisation of private resources. The whole support of the Instrument to sustainable development – including the mobilised private finance - should be monitored through the Total Official Support for Sustainable Development.  (31) The Instrument should contribute to the Union collective target of reaching 0.2 % of g ross n ational i ncome as ODA to l east d eveloped c ountries within the timeframe of the 2030 Agenda, by supporting realistic, verifiable actions to meet this commitment, on which progress should continue to be monitored and reported.  (32) The Instrument should enhance the Union’s competitiveness, in particular by contributing to the sustainability, resilience and diversification of value and supply chains , reflecting high standards of responsible business practice, and by increasing economic opportunities . Consistency between the implementation of the Union’s trade , economic security , and industrial policies and th e Instrument should be ensured , including synergies with Clean T rade and I nvestment P artnerships . In particular, in order to harness the potential of mutually beneficial partnerships for sustainable development in the Union and partner countries , synergies should be fostered between the Instrument and the Union’s European Competitiveness Fund , established by Regulation (EU) [XXX] by the European Parliament and Council 31 , as well as the Connecting Europe Facility, established by Regulation (EU) [XXX] by the European Parliament and Council 32 , in supporting projects of common interest between Member States and partner countries, for the part of the project on the territory of the partner country .  (33) Complementarity should be ensured among the Union’s external financing instruments, in particular with Council Decision (EU) 2021 /1764 33 on the association of the overseas countries and territories with the Union, the European Instrument for International Nuclear Safety Cooperation - Decommissioning established by Council Regulation (Euratom) [XXX] [ INSC-D ] 34 , the common foreign and security policy including, where relevant, the Common Security and Defence Policy, and the European Peace Facility , established by Council Decision (CFSP) 2015 / 509 35 , which is financed outside the Union budget.  (34) The Union should seek the most efficient use of available resources among its financing instruments. In this respect, the Instrument should allow for both contributions to and from other Union programmes, as well as the combination of funding with them. This should contribute to the Union’s priorities and interests as well as to sustainable development in the Union’s partner countries . This includes coherence and complementarity with macro-financial assistance, where relevant.  (35) This Regulation should lay down an indicative financial envelope for the Instrument. For the purpose of this Regulation, current prices are calculated by applying a fixed 2% deflator.  (36) In a rapidly changing economic, social and geopolitical environment, recent experience has shown the need for a more flexible multiannual financial framework and Union spending programmes. To that effect, and in line with the objectives of this Regulation, the funding should duly consider the evolving policy needs and Union’s priorities as identified in relevant documents published by the Commission, in Council conclusions and European Parliament resolutions while ensuring sufficient predictability for the budget implementation.  (37) Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) …/… 36 ( MFF Regulation ) allows to mobilise the necessary appropriations in the Union budget over and above the ceilings of the m ultiannual f inancial f ramework to honour the debt liabilities of the Union related to the loans to Ukraine. This financially enables the authorisation under this Regulation of financial assistance to Ukraine in the form of loans in accordance with Article 223(1) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 37 .  (38) In view of the budgetary coverage under the Regulation (EU, Euratom) …/… ( MFF Regulation ) , it is appropriate not to reduce the maximum amount of the aggregate Union financial liabilities covering budgetary guarantees and financial assistance in the form of loans under this Regulation by the amount of financial assistance in the form of loans provided to Ukraine under this Regulation. It is also appropriate not to establish provisioning and, by way of derogation from Article 214(1) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 , not to set a provisioning rate for loans to Ukraine under this Instrument .  (39) As for Union support to Ukraine other than in the form of loans, this Regulation should be financed by the (Ukraine Reserve) as provided for in the Council Regulation [(EU, Euratom) 20XX/XXX * [MFF Regulation] for the period from 1 January 2028 to 31 December 2034 . The commitment appropriations and corresponding payment appropriations from the (Ukraine Reserve) should be mobilised annually through the budget procedure. Additionally, it should be possible to use appropriations mobilised for the purposes of this Regulation from the reserve referred to in Article 6 of Regulation Council Regulation [(EU, Euratom) 20XX/XXX * [MFF Regulation ] ) to provide support to Ukraine under Regulation (Euratom) […] ( INSC-D ) .  (40) In the framework of the Union’s restrictive measures, adopted on the basis of Article 29 TEU and 215(2) TFEU, no funds or economic resources may be made available, directly or indirectly, to or for the benefit of designated natural or l egal persons, entities or bodies. Therefore, s uch natural or legal persons, entities or bodies, as well as legal persons, entities or bodies owned or controlled by them should not be supported by the Instrument.  (41) In a global context where the Union is confronted with high geopolitical and geoeconomic competition, marked by global challenges, ranging from climate change and biodiversity loss to tensions around scarce resources, technological dependencies, continuing migratory pressure or economic and trade disruptions, in addition to security threats and fragility, external action has to continuously and rapidly react to emerging needs, as well as to act to advance strategic priorities, in order to effectively pursue the Union’s and partners’ priorities. To increase the ability of the Union to respond to unforeseen needs and adapt its partnerships to emerging priorities, building on the experience of the European Development Funds and Regulation (EU) 2021/947 , an amount should be left unallocated as an emerging challenges and priorities cushion. It should be mobilised in accordance with the procedures established in this Regulation.  (42) The overall context for action should be the pursuit of a rules-based and value-based global order, with multilateralism as its key principle and the United Nations ( UN ) at its core. The 2030 Agenda, together with the Paris Agreement adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 38 (the ‘Paris Agreement’) , the Kunming - Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework 39 , the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development 40 and the Pact for the Future 41 , is the international community’s response to global challenges and trends in relation to sustainable development. The Instrument should pay particular attention to interlinkages betw een sustainable development goals and to integrated actions that can create co-benefits and meet multiple objectives in a coherent way.  (43) The Instrument should support the implementation of the Samoa Partnership Agreement between the Union and its Member States, of the one part, and the Members of the Organisation of the African, Caribbean and Pacific States, of the other part 42 , signed in Samoa on 15 November 2023 and provisionally applied as from 1 January 2024. T he Instrument should also support the continuation of the established cooperation between the Union and these specific regions, for example with the African Union in line with the EU-AU joint vision for 2030.  (44) The Union should ensure policy coherence for development as required by Article 208 TFEU. The Union should take account of the objectives of development cooperation in the Union policies that are likely to affect developing countries and territories . Ensuring policy coherence for sustainable development requires taking into account the impact of all Union policies on sustainable development at all levels — nationally, within the Union, in other countries and at global level.  (45) In accordance with its international commitments, the Union should apply the development effectiveness principles, namely ownership of development priorities by developing countries and territories , a focus on results, inclusive development partnerships, transparency and mutual accountability. In that regard, the Union and its Member States should maximise the value added of their collective assistance for partner countries and regions. The implementation of the Instrument should be guided by its expected results namely outputs, outcomes and impacts.  (46) The Union should foster close consultation with local authorities and civil society, as well as support their participation in contributing to sustainable development and to the implementation of the sustainable development goals at local level. The Union should also support an enabling environment for civil society , in which these organisations can carry out their work effectively . The Instrument should provide Union support to civil society organisations and local authorities in order to pursue the values, interests and objectives of the Union. Civil society organisations and local authorities should be duly consulted and have timely access to relevant information allowing them to be adequately engaged.  (47) The implementation of the Instrument should be guided by the principles of gender equality, women and girls’ empowerment and of preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence and should seek to protect and promote women’s rights in line with the Roadmap on Women’s Rights 43 , Gender Equality Strategy 44 , EU Gender Action Plans, relevant Council conclusions and international conventions, including the Istanbul Convention on violence against women 45 . Strengthening gender equality and women’s empowerment in the Union’s external action and increasing efforts to reach the minimum standards of performance indicated by the EU Gender Action Plans should lead to a gender sensitive and transformative approach in all Union external action and international cooperation. Gender equality and women’s and girls’ empowerment should be mainstreamed under the Instrument and adequately reflected across all the actions.  (48) The I nstrument should support children and youth as key agents of change, giving particular attention to their needs and empowerment . It should seek to prevent and combat discrimination - based on age, ethnic origin, religion and belief, disability or sexual orientation. It should promote the rights of persons with disabilities , in line with the UN Convention to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 46 .  (49) Recognising that the triple planetary crisis of climate, biodiversity loss and pollution have worsened over the last decade and cannot be solved by the Union alone, by supporting international cooperation the Instrument should play an essential role to meet multilaterally agreed climate and environmental goals . In that regard, the Union should support the most vulnerable countries, in particular the s mall i sland d eveloping s tates and the l east d eveloped c ountrie s.  (50) Reflecting the importance of tackling climate change in line with the Union’s commitments to implement the Paris Agreement and the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework and to achieve the sustainable development goals, t he Instrument should contribute to mainstreaming climate action in the Union policies . Relevant actions should be identified during the implementation of the Instrument, and the overall contribution from the Instrument should be part of relevant monitoring evaluations and review processes. The Instrument should contribute to halting and reversing the decline of biodiversity building on the interlinkages between climate and biodiversity goals.  (51) Union action in the area of climate change and biodiversity should support a just transition to a climate-neutral , climate resilient, resource efficient and circular economy. It should notably favour the adherence to and implementation of the Paris Agreement, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, the UN Convention to Combat Desertification and the Agreement on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas beyond National Jurisdiction. In particular, funding allocated in the context of the Instrument should be coherent with and support the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement of limiting the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels while pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1 . 5°C. T he Instrument should be coherent with the objective to increase the ability to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change, reduce vulnerability, foster climate resilience and align with the objectives of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. In line with the European Ocean Pact 47 , the Instrument should promote the preservation of the ocean and strengthen international rules-based ocean governance . Particular attention should be given to actions that create co-benefits and meet multiple objectives, including for climate, biodiversity and the environment.  (52) Article 33(2), point (d), of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 requires programmes and activities to be implemented, where feasible and appropriate, without doing significant harm to the environmental objectives set out in Article 9 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 48 (the ‘do no significant harm principle’). To ensure a consistent implementation of that principle throughout the budget, the Instrument should apply the do no significant harm principle in line with the common rules established by Regulation (EU, Euratom) [XXX] of the European Parliament and Council [ Performance Regulation ] and following the single technical guidance ('do no significant harm guidance') ,  (53) The Instrument should promote digital cooperation with partner countries and the ir digital transition, in line with the International Digital Strategy for the European Union 49 and the Competitiveness Compass 50 .  (54) In accordance with Article 210 TFEU, the Union and its Member States should increase their collective impact by bring ing together to the fullest possible range their respective resources and capacities.  (55) The Union’s and Member States’ international cooperation policies should operate in a Team Europe approach 51 , thereby complement ing and reinforc ing each other to improve the effectiveness, impact and value added of their collective assistance.  (56) The Union, its Member States, Member States’ implementing agencies and financial institutions, including development finance institutions and Member States export credit agencies, the European Investment Bank (the ‘EIB’) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the ‘EBRD’) should seek to support partner countries and Union strategic interests outside the Union through jointly identified and implemented actions. This approach should be inclusive and open to like-minded partners and stakeholders to pool resources and jointly contribute to the achievement of common goals including through the use of the budgetary guarantee and blending .  (57) The Union should favour a constructive engagement on all aspects of migration and forced displacement, working to ensure that migration takes place in a safe and well-regulated manner and support is provided to forcibly displaced people and their host communities. It is essential to further step up cooperation on migration with partner countries while respecting competences of Member States, reaping the benefits of orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and effectively addressing irregular migration. Such cooperation should contribute to mitigating the impact of forced displacement, ensuring access to international protection, addressing the root causes of irregular migration and of forced displacement, enhancing border management and pursuing efforts to prevent irregular migration, fighting against trafficking in human beings and migrant smuggling, and working on dignified and sustainable returns, readmission and reintegration where relevant, on the basis of mutual accountability and full respect of humanitarian and human rights obligations under international and Union law, and by engaging with diasporas and supporting legal migration pathways. Therefore, partner countries’ effective cooperation with the Union in this area should be an integral element of the Instrument. Increased coherence between migration, asylum , return and external policies is important to ensure that the Union’s external assistance supports partner countries to manage migration more effectively towards sustainable development. The Instrument should contribute to a coordinated, holistic and structured approach to migration, maximising synergies and applying the necessary leverage.  (58) The Instrument should enable the Union, in cooperation with Member States, to comprehensively respond to challenges, needs and opportunities related to migration and forced displacement in a way that is coherent with and complementary to Union migration and asylum policy . Migration-related actions under the Instrument should contribute to the effective implementation of Union agreements and dialogues on migration with partner countries by encouraging cooperation relying on a flexible incitative approach and supported by a coordination mechanism under the Instrument. The coordination mechanism should enable ongoing and emerging migration and forced displacement challenges to be addressed under the Instrument, using all appropriate components through flexible funding, while respecting its financial envelopes and relying on their flexible implementation. Those actions should be implemented in full respect of international law, including international human rights, international humanitarian law and refugee law, and Union and national competences.  (59) Under the Instrument, the Union should address human rights and democratic governance at all levels, including through election observation missions, in line with the EU Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy 52 . Where relevant, Union assistance in areas pertaining to the protection of human rights and democratic values and principles and support to civil society actors should be independent from the consent of the governments and public authorities of the partner countries concerned. As the respect for democracy, human rights and the rule of law is essential for sound financial management and effective Union funding as referred to in Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 , assistance could be suspended in the event of degradation in democracy, human rights or the rule of law in third countries .  (60) Funding under the Instrument should be used to finance actions for the international dimension of the Erasmus+ programme , including in line with the Union of Skills 53 . The multiannual programming of the international dimension of Erasmus+ under this Instrument should be implemented in accordance with the procedures established in Regulation (EU) [XXX] of the European Parliament and Council [ Erasmus+ Regulation ] 54 .  (61) The Instrument should contribute to foster international cultural relations and recognise the role of culture in promoting the Union’s values.  (62) Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 applies to this Instrument. It lays down the rules on the establishment and the implementation of the general budget of the European Union, including the rules on grants, prizes, non-financial donations, procurement, indirect management , financial assistance, financial instruments and budgetary guarantees.  (63) Annual or multi-annual action plans and measures referred to in this Regulation should constitute work programmes within the meaning of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 . Annual or multi-annual action plans should consist of a set of measures grouped into one document.  (64) Rules on effective establishment or nationality, or the type of participants in award procedures, including with respect to their direct and indirect control by entities of a partner country, as well as the origin of products may be restricted, including where such restrictions are in the strategic interests of the Union. Such restrictions could, for example, apply to high-risk suppliers, where relevant.  (65) While respecting the principle that the Union budget is set annually, external volatility requires to preserve the flexibilities already allowed under Regulation (EU) 2021/947 concerning carry-overs . By way of derogation from Article 12(4) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 , to ensure the efficient use of the Union funds both for Union citizens and the partner countries, thus maximising the Union funds available for the Union’s external action interventions, carry-overs stemming from the Instrument should be available to be reused under this Instrument. By way of derogation from Article 212(3) of Regulation (EU, Euratom ) 2024/2509 , revenue, repayments and recoveries from financial instruments established by external action programmes under this or preceding multiannual financial frameworks should be available to be reused under this Instrument. This will make available the necessary resources to fund the most pressing additional needs of the EU’s external relations of the moment.  (66) To increase the resources available for th e Instrument by assigning to it the surpluses related to the Guarantee Fund for external actions established by Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 480/2009, the European Fund for Sustainable Development (EFSD) established by Regulation (EU) 2017/1601 55 , the European Fund for Sustainable Development Plus (EFSD+) established by Regulation (EU) 2021/ 947 , the Ukraine Guarantee established by Regulation (EU) 2024/792, the financial assistance in the form of loans established under Regulations (EU) 2024/1449, and (EU) 2025/535 , and the budgetary guarantee and financial assistance under this Instrument, derogation s from Article 216(4), point (a), of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 and from Article 31(8) of Regulation (EU) 2021/947 are is required. This will make available the necessary resources to fund the most pressing additional needs of the EU’s external relations of the moment .  (67) To ensure flexibility, Article 114(2), third subparagraph of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 should not apply to the multiannual actions under this Instrument.  (68) The types of financing and the methods of implementation under this Regulation should be chosen on the basis of their ability to achieve the specific objectives of the actions and to deliver results, taking into account, in particular, the costs of controls, the administrative burden and the expected risk of non-compliance. When making that choice, the use of lump sums, unit costs and flat rates, as well as financing not linked to costs of the relevant operation as referred to in Article 125(1), point (a), of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 , should be considered. The Union should be able to entrust budget implementation tasks under Article 62(1), point (c) (viii) of Regulation (EU) 2024/2509 to the Union Institute for Security Studies and the European Security and Defence College t o implement actions under the Instrument.  (69) By way of derogation from Article 192(1) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509, the Union should be able to provide support in the form of grants in a flexible and timely manner without the need for a call for proposals, for example, in difficult conditions and cases of urgency and crisis, to support human rights defenders and other civil society actors. Under the conditions set out in Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509, grants funded by the Instrument could also be provided to civil society organisations and other entities which do not have legal personality under the applicable national law.  (70) Without prejudice to the use of competitive procedures wherever appropriate in accordance with Article 192(1) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 , grants could be provided to entities governed by private law from a Member State without a call for proposals where the relevant project is in the strategic interest of the Union and supports the objectives of the Instrument. Such a direct award could be justified, for example, to enable investments or finance feasibility studies in strategic areas such as critical raw materials , climate change resilience or digital and other infrastructure, in particular as part of integrated packages, to enhance the Union’s strategic autonomy. In accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 , any such award should respect the general principles applicable to grants and be duly justified in the award decision.  (71) In line with the Team Europe approach, actions in indirect management should preferably be entrusted to the EIB , the EBRD , or a Member State organisation in the sense of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 .  (72) In indirect management with partner countries or the bodies they designate where the Commission retains financial management responsibilities in accordance with Article 157(7), second subparagraph, point ( a), of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/ 2509 , the Commission, when making payments on behalf of the contracting authorities directly to their recipients should be able to subsequently recover related amounts due directly from the contracting authorities' recipients. Likewise, in cases of indirect management where the partner countries or the bodies they designate do not or become unable to perform the budget implementation tasks entrusted, the Commission should be able to temporarily take their place and act in their name and on their behalf in indirect management.  (73) Pursuant to Article 85(1) of Council Decision (EU) 2021/1764, persons and entities established in overseas countries and territories are eligible for funding subject to the rules and objectives of the Instrument and possible arrangements applicable to the Member State to which the relevant overseas country or territory is linked. In order to reinforce the effectiveness and impact of the Union's action, c ooperation between the partner countries and regions, the overseas countries and territories as well as the Union outermost regions under Article 349 TFEU should be encouraged in areas of common interest.  (74) The Instrument should enable the provision of support in the form of budgetary guarantees and financial assistance. The provisioning and liabilities arising from those operations and the financial assistance should be supported by appropriations under the Instrument.  (75) With a view to ensuring consistency, the budgetary guarantee and financial instruments, including when combined with non-repayable support in blending operations, and financial assistance under th e Instrument should be implemented in accordance with Title X of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 and with technical arrangements, terms and conditions established by the Commission for the purposes of its application.  (76) After the EFSD in 2017-2020 and the EFSD+ in 2021-2027, this is the third multiannual financial framework where a budgetary guarantee is used to support external actions. The budgetary guarantee has become a standard tool in the Union’s financial toolbox and its main rules and procedures are enshrined in Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 . Only specific provisions applicable to the budgetary guarantee under the Instrument are foreseen in this Regulation. On the other hand, recognising that the investments mobilised by the Union in partner countries may need a flexible use and combination of the various forms of Union’s funding available under the Instrument, no particular treatment of blending operations and the budgetary guarantee under a specific fund, such as EFSD or EFSD+, is foreseen.  (77) To provide for predictability and flexibility, it is necessary to set a maximum amount of the budgetary guarantee and the maximum amount of the aggregate Union financial liabilities covering the budgetary guarantee and financial assistance in the form of loans under the Instrument.  (78) In accordance with Article 214(1) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 , this R egulation should provide for the review of the provisioning rate s . It should therefore be possible to amend the provisioning rate s throughout the multiannual financial framework period following regular review, which sh ould be based on the Commission ’s risk management framework taking into account sound financial management.  (79) To comply with the requirements of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 , this Regulation should set out the possibility for third parties and partner countries to contribute to the budgetary guarantee .  (80) It should be possible that the budgetary guarantee authorised under this Regulation serve s as a horizontal delivery tool also for Council Decision (EU) 2021/1764 and Regulation (Euratom) [XXX] [ INSC -D ] , to provide support under other Union programmes in accordance with the objectives and eligibility criteria set out in those programmes. For that purpose, the corresponding provisioning of financial liabilities should be made from the financial envelope of those other programmes.  (81) To ensure sound financial management and budgetary discipline and to limit outstanding payments, the provisioning for the budgetary guarantee and financial assistance should not be committed after the end of the last year of the multiannual financial framework and should be constituted by the end of the third year after the end of the multiannual financial framework . Budgetary commitments for that provisioning should take into account the progress in granting the budgetary guarantee and financial assistance. The constitution of the provisioning should take into account the progress in the approval and signature of the financing and investment operations and in the disbursement of the financial assistance.  (82) In order to promote the participation of eligible implementing entities and counterparts from partner countries benefiting from the budgetary guarantee or financial instruments, by way of derogation from Article 211 ( 5) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 , the partner country should not be required to contribute to the budgetary guarantee or the financial instruments. Moreover, in order to provide flexibility, increase the attractiveness for the private sector and maximise the impact of the investments, a derogation from Article 62(1) , point ( c) and Article 211(5) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 , should be provided allowing bodies subject to private law which provide adequate assurance of their financial capacity and which are neither entrusted with a public service mission nor with the implementation of a public-private partnership to be eligible implementing entities and counterparts .  (83) Blending and budgetary guarantees play a central role in the Union’s investment strategy in partners countries. It is, therefore, appropriate to set up a Global Europe Investment Board to provide strategic and operational guidance to the Commission in their implementation.  (84) It is appropriate to organise the financial assistance under the diversified funding strategy provided for in Article 224 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 and established as a single funding method therein, which is expected to enhance the liquidity of Union debt securities and the attractiveness and cost-effectiveness of Union issuance.  (85) The Commission could provide financial assistance to partners countries in the form of policy-based loans. The primary purpose of such policy-based loans should be to support partner country’s reform programmes and catalyse investments. They should contribute to achieving national policy goals and meeting global challenges. The conditions applicable to policy-based loans should, where relevant, be aligned to the conditions of budget support in accordance with Article 241(1) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 . A debt analysis should be conducted prior to the approval of any loan. This analysis should assess the country's ability to sustain its debt levels over the loan term.  (86) In order to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation , the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of amending the specific objectives listed in Annex II, the percentage of expenditure fulfilling the criteria of ODA , the maximum amount s of the budgetary guarantee and the provisioning rates . It is of particular importance that the Commission carr ies out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making 56 . In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States' experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.  (87) Cooperation with partner countries covered under the Europe pillar occurs in the context of a special relationship with the Union, including through, where relevant, the preparation of candidate countries and potential candidates for future accession. Such cooperation requires the establishment of specific conditions reflecting this highly ambitious relationship. For this purpose, relevant for Enlargement and Neighbourhood East partners in the Europe pillar, specific rules related to the relevant performance-based plans serving as a basis for programming should be established in line with the correspondingly high ambition of mutual relations between the partner count r ies and the Union. In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of such engagement and for the implementation modalities that are designed to prepare for the management of internal funds, such as structural, agricultural and rural development and cross-border cooperation funds, including, where relevant, for indirect management by the partner countries , implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by the Member States of the Commission's exercise of implementing powers 57 . Those uniform conditions should be amended if developments so require.  (88) In the context of assistance provided to Enlargement and Neighbourhood East partners in the Europe pillar, cooperation should build on the lessons learn ed from the management and implementation of past assistance and performance-based facilities, including in relation to the relevant performance -based plans, conditionality linked to rule of law principles and human rights , performance, structures and control systems to be set up in preparation of accession. Where relevant, financial assistance in the form of a policy-based loan may be provided to partner countries implementing p erformance-based plans.  (89) In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of the Instrument through the relevant implementing acts, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011. The Commission may adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases relating to crises or immediate threats to peace, democracy, the rule of law, human rights or fundamental freedoms, imperative grounds of urgency so require.  (90) The Instrument should contribute to strengthening awareness, understanding and perception of the Union in a Team Europe approach in partner countries. The objective should be to position the Union as a reliable partner that is commensurate with the scale, scope and ambition of the Union ’s political commitment and sustained investment. This should be achieved through impactful strategic communication , and in line with Regulation (EU, Euratom) [XXX] [ Performance Regulation ] 58 .  (91) The Instrument is to be implemented in accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) [XXX] [Performance Regulation] which establishes the rules for the expenditure tracking and the performance framework for the budget, including rules for ensuring a uniform application of the principles of ‘do no significant harm’ and gender equality referred to in Article 33(2), points (d) and (f), of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 respectively, rules for monitoring and reporting on the performance of Union programmes and activities, rules for establishing a Union funding portal, rules for the evaluation of the programmes, rules for the evaluation of the programmes, as well as other horizontal provisions applicable to all Union programmes such as those on information, communication and visibility.  (92) The references to the Union ’s external assistance instruments in Article 9 of Decision 2010/427/EU, which are the predecessors to the Instrument established by this Regulation, should be construed as references to this Regulation. The Commission should ensure that this Regulation is implemented in accordance with the role of the European External Action Service as provided in that Decision.  (93) In accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 , Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council 59 , Council Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2988/95 60 , Council Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 61 and Council Regulation (EU) 2017/1939 62 , the financial interests of the Union are to be protected through proportionate measures, including the prevention, detection, correction and investigation of irregularities and fraud, the recovery of funds lost, wrongly paid or incorrectly used and, where appropriate, the imposition of administrative sanctions. In particular, in accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 and Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 , the European Anti-Fraud Office ( ‘ OLAF ’ ) may carry out investigations, including on-the-spot checks and inspections, with a view to establishing whether there has been fraud, corruption or any other illegal activity affecting the financial interests of the Union. In accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017/1939, the European Public Prosecutor's Office ( ‘ EPPO ’ ) may investigate and prosecute fraud and other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Union as provided for in Directive (EU) 2017/1371 of the European Parliament and of the Council 63 . In accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 , any person or entity receiving Union funds is to fully cooperate in the protection of the Union’s financial interests, to grant the necessary rights and access to the Commission, OLAF, the EPPO and the European Court of Auditors and to ensure that any third parties involved in the implementation of Union funds grant equivalent rights.  (94) This Instrument replaces the programmes established by Regulations (EU) 2021/947, (EU) 2021/1529, (EU) 2024/792, (EU) 2024/1449 and (EU) 2025/535.

FRAMEWORK OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE  1.1. Title of the proposal/initiative  Global Europe  1.2. Policy area(s) concerned  External Action  1.3. Objective(s)  1.3.1. General objective(s)  The general objective of the proposed Instrument, Global Europe, is to uphold and promote the Union’s values, principles and interests worldwide in order to pursue the objectives and principles of the Union’s external action, as laid down in Article 3(5), Articles 8 and 21 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU).  1.3.2. Specific objective(s)  The specific objectives of the Instrument are spelt out in Annex II.  1.3.3. Expected result(s) and impact  Specify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.  Global Europe will contribute to the objectives of the EU’s external action, by promoting mutually beneficial partnerships with third countries, contributing simultaneously to the sustainable development of third countries and to the Union’s strategic interests. Global Europe will also allow the Union to be better positioned to address global challenges.  1.3.4. Indicators of performance  Specify the indicators for monitoring progress and achievements.  The output and result indicators for the purpose of monitoring progress and achievements of this programme will correspond to the common indicators provided under Regulation (EU, Euratom) [XXX] [Performance Regulation].  1.4. The proposal/initiative relates to:  ¨ a new action  ¨ a new action following a pilot project / preparatory action 72  ¨ the extension of an existing action  x a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action  1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative  1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative  The objective of the proposed Instrument, Global Europe, is to uphold and promote the Union’s values, principles and interests worldwide in order to pursue the objectives and principles of the Union’s external action, as laid down in Article 3(5), Articles 8 and 21 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU).  Global Europe will contribute to the objectives of the EU’s external action, by promoting mutually beneficial partnerships with third countries, contributing simultaneously to the sustainable development of third countries and to the Union’s strategic interests. Global Europe will also allow the Union to be better positioned to address global challenges.  1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, great er effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this section 'added value of EU involvement' is the value resulting from EU action, that is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.  Reasons for action at EU level (ex-ante)  The international landscape has changed significantly over the last years, appearing far less predictable and stable. Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, including its global impact, instability and conflict in the Middle East, pandemics, trade tensions, economic coercion, competition on technology and access to critical raw materials and the US administration’s disengagement from development cooperation, humanitarian aid and multilateral institutions represent significant geopolitical and geoeconomic challenges both for the EU and partner countries. Furthermore, the gap to reach the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 continues to widen, global fragility is on the rise, and the impacts of climate change and biodiversity loss continue to increase. These challenges require the EU to continue adapting its external action financing.  EU’s external action financing seeks to partner with third countries, as well as promote multilateral solutions to global challenges. It enables the EU to defend its interests, to promote its values and standards, to support the objectives of its internal policies, ensure its security and protect its citizens. The mid-term evaluation of EU's External Financing Instruments for the 2021 - 2027 multiannual financial framework confirmed the added value that the External Financing Instruments bring to EU’s external relations, as they provide a more integrated and sizable offer to partner countries, improving their capacity to address shared priorities with the EU and contributing to sustainable development.  As a party to most multilateral processes, the EU can engage with multilateral and regional partners in key policy areas. Compared to its Member States acting separately, the EU, together with Member States, can achieve greater impact by coordinating common positions and speaking with a stronger voice. As a world’s leading proponent and defender of multilateral and rule-based global governance system, the EU has credibility as an honest broker and defender of core international human rights instruments. This leverage in multilateral and regional fora also enables the Union to project globally its policies and values, as well as influence the shaping of global norms and regulatory standards. The EU’s financial commitment is an integral part of the overall engagement in several multilateral agreements (e.g. climate and biodiversity).  Through the increased use of budgetary guarantees and blending operations, the EU incentivises and pools together public and private investments, including to the benefit of countries and sectors having difficult access to financial markets. Finally, the EU triggers collaboration among development financial institutions. Macro- financial assistance provides much needed financing for countries experiencing balance of payments crises, with favourable conditions.  Expected generated EU added value (ex-post)  The expected added value generated by Global Europe should follow on from the findings of the mid-term evaluation of EU's External Financing Instruments for the 2021 - 2027 Multiannual Financial Framework. Global Europe should allow to consolidate and streamline external action financing, enabling the Union to protect its interests abroad and adapt to evolving circumstances and needs. The Union shall strive to ensure policy coherence, taking into account the impact of all internal and external policies and promoting increased synergies and complementarities.  Global Europe shall provide all the tools for the EU to effectively operate in its external action. The readiness of this toolbox will ensure that the most appropriate tools are deployed in every circumstance depending on the objectives and the situation on the ground, with the possibility to adapt to evolving contexts.  This will harness the potential of mutually beneficial partnerships packages targeted for individual partner countries.  1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past  The mid-term evaluation on the EU’s external financing instruments confirms that the current instruments are largely fit for purpose . The evaluation corroborates that NDICI-Global Europe is on track to deliver against the objectives it was expected to fulfil at the time of its adoption. Moreover, the objectives of NDICI-Global Europe continue to be relevant and the instrument effectively serves the roll-out the Global Gateway strategy. In a similar vein, the mid-term evaluation shows that IPA III has demonstrated its general effectiveness as a pre-accession instrument and is likewise on track to meet its objectives. The instrument is aligned with the enlargement methodology and mirrors EU policy developments, such as the focus on green, digital and economic priorities.  However, following years of instability in the EU’s neighbourhood and beyond, the geopolitical stakes for the EU are far higher than when the 2021-2027 MFF was adopted. The EU operates in a highly volatile and unpredictable environment, characterised by geopolitical rivalry, geoeconomic competition, strategic dependencies, competitiveness challenges, the worsening triple planetary crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution, and increasing global fragility. This changing geopolitical landscape and a string of poly-crises have exposed some architectural weaknesses in the design of the external financing instruments.  Simultaneously, the link between EU external and internal policies has become increasingly relevant and is currently not sufficiently catered for – neither in the external nor in the internal financing instruments - and the interplay of external and internal financing instruments is sub-optimal.  As a result, while current external financing instruments are effective in delivering on their expected results, the changing geopolitical landscape and the era of poly-crises have exposed some architectural weaknesses in their design. Partner country, regional and global contexts evolve rapidly while the split between stand-alone pre-programmed and pre-earmarked instruments is not conducive to swift adaptation. Different strands of external action financing are currently fragmented into different financing instruments. The financial and operational barriers between different instruments hamper synergic approaches at the regional level (i.e. humanitarian-development-peace nexus), flexibility in reacting to evolving priorities and interplay between the Enlargement and Neighbourhood policies. There are therefore gains to be made, in terms of overall synergy and flexibility, in ensuring a common source of funding for most of the Union external action instruments, while preserving the capacity of the Union to conduct a principled humanitarian aid policy under Article 214 TFEU. While the budget to finance the Union’s humanitarian aid operations should be made available under this Instrument, such operations should therefore continue to be implemented in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/96.  Lastly, the Communication on ‘the road to the next multiannual financial framework’ strives for external action financing that is better aligned with the EU’s strategic interests. However, the existing toolbox (intervention modalities) is not sufficient to advance them.  1.5.4. Compatibility with the multiannual financial framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments  When implementing this Regulation, consistency with other areas of external action and with other relevant EU policies will be ensured, together with policy coherence for development. As incorporated in the 2030 Agenda, this means taking into account the impact of all policies on sustainable development at all levels — nationally, within the EU, in other countries and at global level.  The Regulation is enabling in nature, which allows it to cater for different policy objectives in synergy with other Union policies. Moreover, synergies with actions under other EU programmes should be sought, in order to maximise the impact of combined interventions. In particular, articulation with the European Competitiveness Fund will be crucial to take various work streams (e.g. critical raw materials and related value chains, economic security and the Clean Industrial Deal) to the next level. Synergies with the Union’s strategic interests is strenghtened also by the updated toolbox. Finally, the implementation of this Regulation will be monitored and evaluated through the performance framework for the post-2027 MFF, ensuring increased coherence between different Union programmes in monitoring and evaluation.  1.5.5.

Comments  External expenditure requires the ability to use all foreseen management modes as relevant and decided during the implementation.  MANAGEMENT MEASURES  2.1. Monitoring and reporting rules  An implementation report will be published by the Commission no later than four years after the start of the programme’s implementation, in order to assess the progress made towards the achievement of their objectives, in line with Regulation (EU, Euratom) [XXX] [Performance Regulation]. A retrospective evaluation will be carried out by the Commission at the latest three years after the end of the MFF period with a view to assessing the effectiveness, efficiency, relevance, coherence and Union added value of the programme.  2.2. Management and control system(s)  2.2.1. Justification of the budget implementation method(s), the funding implementation mechanism(s), the payment modalities and the control strategy proposed  Budget implementation methods  Regarding the management modes, there are no fundamental changes foreseen and the experience acquired by the Commission services and implementing actors under the predecessor programmes will contribute to better results in the future.  The actions to be financed under this Regulation will be implemented under direct management by the Commission from headquarters and/or through the Union delegations and under indirect management by any of the entities listed in article 62(1)(c) of the Financial Regulation in order to better achieve the objectives of the Regulation.  Concerning indirect management, as stated in Article 157 of the Financial Regulation, the Commission must ensure a level of protection of the EU’s financial interests equivalent to the one under direct management. An ex ante pillar assessment of the entities' systems and procedures will be carried out, in accordance with the principle of proportionality and with due consideration for the nature of the action and the financial risks involved. Where the implementation requires so or there have been reservations expressed in Annual Activities Reports, action plans with specific mitigation measures will be defined and implemented. Additionally, appropriate supervisory measures imposed by the Commission may accompany the implementation.  Budget support will also be used.  Innovative financial instruments including in partnership with the European Investment Bank (EIB), Member States’ financial institutions and other international financial institutions will be used for blending activities. The possibility to use trust funds continues to be enabled by the Financial Regulation.  The internal control and management process is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of objectives in the effectiveness and efficiency of the operations, the reliability of the financial reporting and compliance with the relevant legislative and procedural framework.  Effectiveness and efficiency  To ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of the operations (and to mitigate the high level of risk in the external assistance environment), in addition to all the elements of the Commission wide strategic policy and planning process, internal audit environment and other requirements of the Commission's Internal Control Framework, the implementing services will continue to have a tailored aid management framework in operation under all the instruments which will include:  –   A devolved management of the majority of external assistance by Union delegations in the field.  –   Clear and formalised lines of financial accountability (from the Delegated Authorising officer (Director General)) by means of a sub-delegation from the Sub-delegated Authorising Officer (Director) at headquarters to the Head of Delegation;  –   Regular reporting from Union Delegations to Headquarters, including an annual Statement of Assurance by the Head of Delegation;  –   Provision of a substantial programme of training for staff both at headquarters and in delegations,  –   Significant Headquarters/Delegation support and guidance (including via internet);  –   Regular supervision missions to Delegations every 3 to 6 years;  –   A project and programme cycle management methodology including: quality support tools for the design of the intervention, the delivery method, financing mechanism, management system, assessment and selection of any implementing partners, etc.; programme and project management, monitoring and reporting tools for effective implementation including regular external on-the-spot monitoring of projects; and significant evaluation and audit components. Simplifications will be sought by extending, where appropriate and feasible, the use of simplified cost options. There will be a continuation of a risk-differentiated controls approach in accordance with the underlying risks.  Financial Reporting and Accounting  The implementing services will continue to pursue the highest standards of accounting and financial reporting using the Commission's corporate financial system (SUMMA) as well as external aid specific tools such OPSYS.  In relation to compliance with the relevant legislative and procedural framework, compliance control methods are set out in section 2.3 (measures to prevent fraud and irregularities).  2.2.2. Information concerning the risks identified and the internal control system(s) set up to mitigate them  The operational environment of cooperation under this instrument is characterised by the risks of not achieving the instrument's objectives, sub-optimal financial management and/or of not complying with the applicable rules (legality and regularity errors) related to:  – Economic and political instability and natural disaster s and extreme climatic events that may lead to difficulties and delays in the design and implementation of interventions, particularly in fragile states;  – l imited institutional and administrative capacity in partner countries that may lead to difficulties and delays in the design and implementation of interventions;  – geographically dispersed interventions (covering approximately many states , territories and regions) may pose logistical and resource challenges to monitoring - particularly any 'on-the-spot' follow-up of activities;  – diversity of potential partners or beneficiaries with their diverse internal control structures and capacities can fragment and therefore reduce the effectiveness and efficiency of the Commission's available resources to support and monitor implementation;  – limited availab ility of qualititative and quantitative data on the outcomes and impact of external assistance implementation in partner countries may hinder the Commission's ability to report on and be accountable for results.  In order to deal with the risk of financial errors, the Commission will perform the appropriate ex ante and ex post controls. When possible and applicable the performance of systems audits will work as a tool to identify root causes of errors in the entities’ control systems and trigger the necessary mitigating measures.  Moreover, to strengthen its effectiveness in preventing errors, management deficiencies and irregulairies, the Commission is setting up a system for an ongoing targeted risk assessment at contract and at entity level. Key factors increasing the likelihood of a high error rate and a negative impact on sound financial management, in particular linked also to historical data of previous controls and monitoring haven been identified and aggregated in a risk profiling dashboard. The dashboard will provide an important tool to target more effectively future controls, monitoring efforts and other means of mitigation to sensibly reduce the risks of errors, management deficiencies and irregularities.  Given the high risk environment, the systems need to anticipate a significant occurrence of potential compliance errors in transactions and build in a high level of prevention, detection and correction controls as early as possible, before or during, in the payment process. This means in practice that compliance controls will place most reliance on significant ex-ante checks on a multi-annual basis by both external auditors and Commission staff in the field before final project payments (while still executing some ex-post audits), going well beyond the financial safeguards required by the Financial Regulation. This framework include:  – Ex-ante transaction checks performed by Commission staff;  – Audits and verifications (both mandatory and risk based) including the European Court of Auditors;  – Retrospective checks (on a risk basis) and recoveries;  2.2.3. Estimation and justification of the cost-effectiveness of the controls (ratio between the control costs and the value of the related funds managed), and assessment of the expected levels of risk of error (at payment & at closure)  The internal control/management costs planned for the overall (operational + administrative) commitments on the expenditure portfolio financed by the General Budget of the EU for the period 2028-2034 refers only to the costs of the Commission, excluding Member States or entrusted entities. Entrusted entities can withhold up to 7 % for the administration of funds, which could partially be used for control purposes. These management costs take into account all staff at headquarters and in delegations, infrastructure, travel, training, monitoring, evaluation and audit contracts (including those launched by beneficiaries).  While improvements in the nature and targeting of management activities and compliance checks in relation to the portfolio will continue to be pursued, these costs are globally necessary to effectively and efficiently achieve the objectives of the instruments at a minimal risk of non compliance (below 2% residual error). They are significantly less than risks involved in removing or scaling back internal controls in this high risk area.  The compliance objective for the Instrument is on one side to maintain the historic level of risk of non-compliance (error rate) and on the other to at less than 2% the residual 'net' level of error (on a multi-annual basis after all planned controls and corrections have been executed on closed contracts). Where weaknesses are identified, targeted corrective measures will be implemented in the light of ensuring minimum error rates.  2.3. Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities  There are no fundamental changes foreseen in the measures to prevent fraud and irregularities, and the experience acquired by the Commission services and implementing actors under the predecessor programmes will contribute to better results in the future. The Compliance framework is made up inter alia of the following significant components:  Preventative measures  – Compulsory core training covering fraud issues for aid management staff and auditors;  – Provision of guidance (including via internet) including existing manual of procedures such as the Companion, PRAG and the Financial Management Toolkit (for implementing partners);  – Ex-ante assessment to ensure that appropriate anti-fraud measures to prevent and detect fraud in the management of Union funds are in place in the authorities managing the relevant funds under joint and decentralised management);  – Ex-ante screening of the anti-fraud mechanisms available in the partner country as part of the assessment of the eligibility criterion of public finance management for receiving budget support (i.e. active commitment to fight fraud and corruption, adequate inspection authorities, sufficient judicial capacity and efficient response and sanction mechanisms);  – Effective anti-fraud mechanisms to prevent and detect fraud, corruption, and other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Union, including cyber-attacks, particularly in relation to new financial instruments such as blending, financing not linked to cost (FNLC), and/or budgetary guarantees, using digital tools and technologies .  Detective and corrective measures  – Suspension of EU funding where there is a serious fraud case, including large scale corruption, until the authorities have taken appropriate action with a view to correcting and preventing such fraud in the future;  – EDES (Early Detection Exclusion System);  – Suspension/termination of contract;  – Exclusion procedure.  Anti-fraud strategies of the services concerned, aligned with the objectives and priorities of the Commission's anti-fraud strategy (CAFS) and its corresponding Action Plan ensures that the systems used for spending EU funds in third countries enable relevant data to be retrieved with a view to feeding this data into fraud risk assessment and management (e.g. double funding, inflation of costs, rigged tender procedures, conflict of interest, collusion); and wherever necessary, networking groups and adequate IT/digital tools aimed at early detection and prevention of fraud risks and fraud cases related to the external aid sector could be set up.  3.

This initiative is designed to address the challenges posed by a rapidly changing global environment, including geopolitical instability, economic challenges, and environmental concerns. The proposal's main goals are to promote EU values and strategic interests worldwide, address global challenges, and support sustainable development.

To achieve these objectives, the proposal consolidates various financial instruments into a single main tool, governed by a unified performance regulation to oversee monitoring, reporting, and evaluation. This consolidation aims to simplify the EU's external action architecture, ensuring coherence by aligning geographical focus and consistency between internal and external programs. Additionally, the framework enhances flexibility through financial mechanisms that allow for easier budgetary adjustments, thereby increasing the impact of EU actions by streamlining processes and promoting European interests more effectively.

A key component of the framework is the Investment Board, which includes representatives from the European Commission, the High Representative, all Member States, and the European Investment Bank (EIB). The European Parliament will have observer status, and other stakeholders may be given observer status where appropriate. The Board will be co-chaired by the Commission and the High Representative, ensuring a coordinated approach to investment decisions.

The proposal emphasizes promoting human rights, democracy, and the rule of law, with specific attention to protecting the most vulnerable, including efforts against corruption and organized crime. It also focuses"
