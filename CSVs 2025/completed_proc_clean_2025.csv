CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  Annexes A and B are decisive in defining the scope of application of Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on insolvency proceedings. They list exhaustively those insolvency proceedings or insolvency practitioners, respectively, of the Member States’ laws, to which the Regulation applies. It is, therefore, important that these Annexes are regularly updated in order to reflect the actual legal situation in the Member States.  Pursuant to Article 1(1), to point (4) of Article 2 and to recital (9) of the Regulation, national proceedings qualify as ‘insolvency proceedings’ in the context of the Regulation only if they are listed in Annex A thereto. Similarly, pursuant to point (5) of Article 2 and to recital (21) of the Regulation the persons and bodies that comply with the definition of ‘insolvency practitioner’ of the Regulation are listed in Annex B.  In July 2022, Slovakia notified the Commission on recent changes of its domestic insolvency law introducing a new preventive restructuring procedure as well as a new type of insolvency practitioner. This was followed by notifications from Estonia, Spain, Malta, and Italy in September 2022, from Belgium in July 2023 and from Luxembourg in January 2024.  The Commission has analyzed the notifications of the said Member States in order to ensure compliance of the notifications with the requirements of the Regulation.  Regulation (EU) 2015/848 should therefore be amended accordingly.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  Regulation (EU) 2015/848 is an important instrument of civil judicial cooperation at EU level. The efficient treatment of cross-border insolvencies of debtors with their centre of main interests in a Member State requires that the scope of the Regulation reflects the actual state of play of domestic insolvency laws. This proposal aims at ensuring that the scope of the Regulation is adjusted to the actual legal framework of the Member States on insolvency by the time of its application.  Directive (EU) 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending Directive (EU) 2017/1132 (Directive on restructuring and insolvency) 1 establishes minimum standards both for preventive restructuring procedures available for debtors in financial difficulty, when there is a likelihood of insolvency, and for procedures leading to a discharge of debts incurred by over-indebted entrepreneurs and allowing them to take up a new activity. National insolvency proceedings transposing this Directive may be covered by the scope of Regulation (EU) 2015/848, if they comply with the requirements of the Regulation vis-à-vis national insolvency proceedings and are included in Annex A of the Regulation.  • Consistency with other Union policies  The Regulation has an important supportive role to the freedom of establishment, to the freedom to provide services and to the free movement of persons.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  The proposal is based on Article 81 (2) (a), (c) and (f) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  Regulation (EU) 2015/848 falls under the shared competence of the European Union. Regulation (EU) 2015/848 provides for a comprehensive set of rules directly applicable to cross-border insolvency proceedings which are referred to in the Annex A and to types of insolvency practitioners referred to in Annex B.  The current proposal however merely modifies these Annexes to accurately reflect the content of national notifications and adapt the Annexes containing the lists of national procedures, or types of insolvency practitioners, respectively, in this field. These changes do not affect any of the obligations and rules set out in the Regulation itself.  As a result, as long as the substantive provisions of the Regulation remain unchanged, changes to Annexes A and B of the Regulation do not affect the substantive set of rules and may only be made by the Union legislature and not by the Member States. Consequently, the amendments to these Annexes are an exclusive competence by nature, and thus are not subject to the subsidiarity test and to the ex-ante review procedure of Protocol No 2 to the Treaties, as the subsidiarity principle is not applicable in the situation at stake.  • Proportionality  The proposal complies with the proportionality principle for the following reasons:  The Commission Proposal replaces the lists in Annexes A and B to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 with new lists taking into account the information notified by the said Member States. Since Annexes A and B are intrinsic part of the Regulation, their modification can only be achieved via the legislative amendment of the Regulation.  The Regulation is directly applicable in the Member States. It is published in the Official Journal of the European Union, therefore its contents are accessible to all interested parties.  • Choice of the instrument  The proposed instrument is a regulation.  Other means would not be adequate for the following reasons:  Under the current legislation, Annexes A and B to the Regulation can only be amended by a regulation to be adopted in the ordinary legislative procedure, under the legal base applied to the original Regulation. Such an amendment shall be proposed by the Commission.  Slovakia, Estonia, Spain, Malta, Italy, Belgium and Luxembourg notified the Commission of amendments to the lists set out in Annexes A and B. Accordingly, the Commission does not have any other option but to propose amendments to these Annexes to the Regulation, insofar as these amendments comply with the requirements set out in the Regulation.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  The envisaged amendments are of a purely technical nature. They contain no substantive change to the Regulation. For such initiatives, in line with the Better Regulation Guidelines of the European Commission, no impact assessment is required.  Furthermore, pursuant to Article 81 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, after the request of the Slovakia to initiate the necessary legislative procedure, followed by similar requests of Estonia, Spain, Malta, Italy, Belgium and Luxembourg, no choice remained available to the Commission, but to comply with these requests, insofar as they fulfil the requirements set out in the Regulation. The preparatory work for the adoption of this proposal did not require any new expertise.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  The proposal has no budgetary implications.  2025/0023 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulation (EU) 2015/848 on insolvency proceedings to replace its Annexes A and B  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 81(2), points (a), (c) and (f) thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) Annexes A and B to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council 2 list the designations given in national law of the Member States , respect ively, to the insolvency proceedings and to the insolvency practitioners to which that Regulation applies. Annex A lists the insolvency proceedings referred to in Article 2 , point (4) , of Regulation (EU) 2015/848 and Annex B lists the insolvency practitioners referred to in Article 2, point (5) , of that Regulation .  (2) In July 2022, Slovakia notified the Commission o f recent changes of its domestic insolvency law introducing a new preventive restructuring procedure and a new type of insolvency practitioner. That notification was followed by notifications from Estonia, Spain, Malta and Italy in September 2022, from Belgium in July 2023 and from Luxembourg in January 2024, all relating to recent changes to their domestic law that introduce new types of insolvency proceedings or insolvency practitioners. Those new types of insolvency proceedings and insolvency practitioners comply with the requirements set out in Regulation (EU) 2015/848 and make it necessary to amend Annexes A and B to that Regulation.  (3) In accordance with [ Articles 1 and 2 ] [ in case of non- participation ] [ Article 3 ] [ in case of participation ] and Article 4a(1) of Protocol No 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, [Ireland has notified [, by letter of …,] its wish to take part in the adoption and application of this Regulation]/[without prejudice to Article 4 of th at Protocol, Ireland is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not be bound by it or subject to its application].  (4) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No 22 on the position of Denmark, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application.  (5) Regulation (EU) 2015/848 should therefore be amended accordingly,  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Article 1  Annexes A and B to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 are replaced by the text set out in the Annex to this Regulation.

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 81(2), points (a), (c) and (f) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,

Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure(1),
Whereas:
(1) Annexes A and B to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council(2)list, respectively, the insolvency proceedings and the insolvency practitioners, as notified by Member States, to which that Regulation applies. Annex A lists the insolvency proceedings referred to in Article 2, point (4), of Regulation (EU) 2015/848 and Annex B lists the insolvency practitioners referred to in Article 2, point (5), of that Regulation.
(2) In July 2022, Slovakia notified the Commission of recent changes to its national law which introduced a new preventive restructuring procedure and a new type of insolvency practitioner. That notification was followed by notifications from Estonia, Spain and Italy in September 2022, from Belgium in July 2023, from Malta in September 2023 and from Luxembourg in January 2024, all relating to recent changes to their national law which introduced new types of insolvency proceedings or insolvency practitioners. Those new types of insolvency proceedings and insolvency practitioners comply with the requirements set out in Regulation (EU) 2015/848 and their introduction makes it necessary to amend Annexes A and B to that Regulation.
(3) After the submission of the Commission’s proposal for this Regulation to the European Parliament and to the Council, further notifications were received from Bulgaria, Czechia, Spain and France relating to recent changes to their national law which also introduced new types of insolvency proceedings or insolvency practitioners.

CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  This proposal seeks to amend Regulation (EU) 2018/196 by including a de minimis threshold for the imposition of retaliation applied in relation to the WTO dispute on the United States’ Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act of 2000 (‘CDSOA’, or the Byrd Amendment ). It also seeks to align the regulation to what is provided in the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-Making.  The CDSOA mandates the yearly distribution of the anti-dumping and countervailing duties collected during the previous fiscal year to US companies. The CDSOA was found incompatible with the United States' WTO obligations in January 2003.  Given that the United States failed to bring itself in compliance with its obligations under the WTO agreements, the Union was authorised to impose an additional import duty above bound customs duties on a list of US products covering on a yearly basis a total value of trade not exceeding the amount of 72 % of the CDSOA disbursement from duties collected on imports from the Union for the most recent year for which data are available. Since 1 May 2005, the Union applies an ad valorem additional customs duty on imports of certain products originating in the United States 1 on a yearly basis, adjusting the level of retaliation proportionately to the amount disbursed from duties collected on Union products in the most recent distribution.  Given the large number of modifications of the initial legal basis (i.e., Council Regulation (EC) No 673/2005) via delegated acts, a codification exercise was undertaken in February 2018. A codified version of the legal basis, Regulation (EU) 2018/196, was adopted by the European Parliament and the Council on 7 February 2018.  By applying the mandated formula to the latest CDSOA distribution of anti-dumping and anti‑subsidy duties collected during the Fiscal Year 2023 (1 October 2022 – 30 September 2023), the resulting level of retaliation to apply as from 1 May 2024 amounted to USD 34,98. That level of retaliation of USD 34,98 represented a significant decrease as compared to the previous level of retaliation and was economically negligible. It would have resulted in subjecting sweet corn, frames and mountings for spectacles, crane lorries, and certain items of women’s or girls’ apparel in denim that originate in the US to an ad valorem additional rate of duty of 0,00002% as from 1 May 2024. As applying such a low duty would have had no trade impact and would have imposed a disproportionate administrative cost to the Union, with Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2024/1239 the additional rate of duty as from 1 May 2024 was set at 0 %. In order to set the duty to 0 % and respect the obligations imposed by the basic Regulation on the Commission, a Delegated Regulation had to enter into force.  The Byrd Amendment was repealed in 2006, but the US created a transitional period whereby disbursements would continue as long as they concerned duties collected before 1 October 2007. Given that the mandated formula is based on the amount of disbursements made in one fiscal year and that the last remaining imports subject to the CDSOA have been liquidated in Fiscal Year 2023, it is expected that in the future the authorised level of retaliation will continue to remain low and will go towards exhaustion. However, it is not possible to determine when the distribution process will end, as disbursements connected to these final imports and amounts held pending litigation are still expected to be made.  Having to adopt a Commission Delegated Regulation each year, even when retaliation is negligible, is not an efficient use of resources. Thus, in order to promote efficiency and proportionality, a de minimis threshold below which additional import duties should not be imposed should be added to Regulation (EU) 2018/196. This threshold should be set at USD 30 000 of CDSOA disbursements made by US authorities in relation to Union imports in one fiscal year (which would correspond to an authorised level of retaliation of USD 21 600).  Disbursement amounting to USD 30 000, keeping the current list of goods in Annex I, would result in an additional rate of duty of about 0,01 %. Additional custom duties equal or below 0,01 % that would apply in the absence of a de minimis provision on the few tariff lines currently included in Annex I do not appear to justify the administrative costs that would be incurred by the Union if these duties were imposed. Below this threshold the duties have no trade impact and are thus economically negligible.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  The proposal is consistent with existing Union trade policy insofar as it preserves the Union’s rights under WTO law while ensuring an efficient use of the Union’s resources.  • Consistency with other Union policies  The proposal is consistent with the Union policies that strive for a more efficient use of human and administrative resources.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  The legal basis for this Regulation Amendment is Article 207(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  The common commercial policy, in accordance with Article 3(1), point (e) of the TFEU, is defined as an exclusive Union competence. Therefore, the subsidiarity principle does not apply.  • Proportionality  This proposal is proportionate as it is necessary in order to ensure an efficient use of the Union’s resources. Having to adopt a Commission Delegated Regulation when retaliation is negligible is not an efficient use of resources.  • Choice of the instrument  This proposal is in accordance with Article 207(2) TFEU, which envisages common commercial policy measures.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  Not applicable.  • Stakeholder consultations  Not applicable.  • Collection and use of expertise  Not applicable.  • Impact assessment  The legislative proposal is not supported by an impact assessment. This is in line with the better regulation toolbox, which provides that an impact assessment may not be necessary for ‘policy initiatives that propose limited changes based on a thorough evaluation, which has clearly identified the necessary amendments to a policy or legislation’. The Commission considers that the proposed regulation fulfils these criteria.  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  The measure does not increase the regulatory burden of companies.  • Fundamental rights  The proposal has no consequences for the protection of fundamental rights.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  Whenever the de minimis would apply, the European Union would see a loss of maximum USD 21 600 (which is the authorised level of retaliation corresponding to USD 30 000 of CDSOA related disbursements) of customs revenue in one fiscal year. On the other hand, the human and administrative resources necessary to adjust and impose the additional customs duty would not be used. Therefore, the impact on Union’s own resources will be very limited.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  Not envisaged.  • Explanatory documents (for directives)  Not applicable.  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  This proposal introduces a de minimis threshold below which additional import duties should not be imposed. This threshold should be set at USD 30 000 of relevant disbursements made by US authorities in one fiscal year. Disbursement amounting to USD 30 000, keeping the current list of goods in Annex I, would result in an additional rate of duty of about 0,01 %. Additional custom duties equal or below 0,01 % that would apply in the absence of a de minimis provision on the few tariff lines currently included in Annex I do not appear to justify the administrative costs that would be incurred by the Union if these duties were imposed. Below this threshold the duties have no trade impact and are thus economically negligible.  Moreover, this proposal adjusts the language of Article 3(3) of Regulation (EU) 2018/196 in order to align it to the standard clauses contained in the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-Making.  2025/0012 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulation (EU) 2018/196 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 February 2018 on additional customs duties on imports of certain products originating in the United States of America  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 207(2) thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) On 27 January 2003, the Dispute Settlement Body (‘DSB’) of the World Trade Organization (‘WTO’) adopted the Appellate Body report 2 and the Panel report 3 , as upheld by the Appellate Body report, finding that the Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act (‘CDSOA’) was incompatible with the United States' obligations under the WTO agreements.  (2) Since the United States failed to bring its legislation into conformity with the WTO agreements, the European Community (‘Community’) requested authorisation from the DSB to suspend the application of its tariff concessions and related obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (‘GATT’) 1994 to the United States 4 . The United States objected to the level of suspension of tariff concessions and related obligations, and the matter was referred to arbitration.  (3) On 31 August 2004, the Arbitrator determined that the level of nullification or impairment caused every year to the Community was equal to 72 % of the amount of CDSOA disbursements relating to anti-dumping or countervailing duties paid on imports from the Community for the most recent year for which data were available at that time, as published by the United States' authorities. The Arbitrator concluded that the suspension by the Community of concessions or other obligations, in the form of the imposition of an additional import duty above bound custom duties, on a list of products originating in the United States covering, on a yearly basis, a total value of trade not exceeding the amount of nullification or impairment would be consistent with WTO rules. On 26 November 2004, the DSB granted the authorisation to suspend the application to the United States of tariff concessions and related obligations under GATT 1994 in accordance with the decision of the Arbitrator.  (4) As a result of the United States’ failure to bring the CDSOA in compliance with its obligations under the WTO agreements, pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/196 of the European Parliament and of the Council 5 a 4,3 % ad valorem additional customs duty was imposed on imports of certain products originating in the United States. In conformity with the WTO authorisation to suspend the application of concessions to the United States, the Commission is to adjust the level of suspension annually to the level of nullification or impairment caused by the CDSOA to the Union at that time.  (5) In recent years, the level of nullification or impairment caused to the Union on the basis of the data published by the United States' Customs and Border Protection has decreased. For example, in 2024, it was calculated at USD 34,98 resulting in a rate of additional import duty of 0,00002 %. As collecting this additional import duty would have no trade effect but result in a disproporti o nate admini s trative cost for the Union, the rate of additional import duty was set at 0 % by Commission Dele g ated Regulation (EU) 2024 /1239 6 , which amend ed Regulation (EU) 2018/196 accordingly.  (6) Given that the CDSOA was effectively repealed on 1 October 2007 , it is expected that the level of nullification or impairment and , consequently , of suspension will stay at this significantly decreased and economically negligible level.  (7) To ensure efficient processes and avoid disproporti on ate admin is trative costs for the Union, Regulation (EU) 2018/196 should be amended by including a de minimis threshold below which no additional import duty should be imposed .  (8) The de minimis threshold should be set at USD 30 000 of disbursements under the CDSOA relating to anti-dumping and countervailing duties paid on imports from the Union for the most recent year for which data are available at that time, as published by the United States' authorities (U.S. Customs and Border Protection). Below such threshold , the additional import dut y, as resulting from the formula mandated by the WTO authorisation, would have no trade impact and would thus be economically negligible. It would also cause disproportionate administrative costs for the Union .  (9) Additionally, Article 3(3) of Regulation (EU) 2018/196 should be amended and a lign ed to the standard clauses contained in the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-Making 7 .

The legislative proposal introduces a de minimis of USD 30 000 of US relevant disbursements.  b. USD 30 000 of US relevant disbursements correspond to an authorised level of additional duties of USD 21 600 .  c. Thus, if the threshold of the de minimis , were not to be met, the highest possible loss of revenue in one fiscal year would be USD 21 599.  d. To this amount (that would have otherwise been collected as customs duty) 2 5 % wa s deducted for collection costs, resulting in USD 1 6 199 ,2 5 .  e. The resulting amount was then converted into euro (conversion rate of 26/12/2024), resulting in EUR 15.586,69 .  Given that the maximum possible impact of revenue (i.e., EUR 15.586,69) is negligible, the proposal is considered to have no financial impact.",['https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-10-2025-0050_EN.html'],"European Parliament legislative resolution of 1 April 2025 on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council  amending Regulation (EU) 2018/196 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 February 2018 on additional customs duties on imports of certain products originating in the United States of America ( COM(2025)0027 – C10-0007/2025 – 2025/0012(COD) )

(As an agreement was reached between Parliament and Council, Parliament's position corresponds to the final legislative act, Regulation (EU) 2025/783.)",,,,,,,,,,"The European Commission has proposed a legislative amendment aimed at refining the process of imposing additional customs duties on certain imports from the United States. This proposal is a response to the U.S.'s Byrd Amendment, which was found to violate World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. The amendment introduces a ""de minimis"" threshold of USD 30,000 for the disbursement of duties collected from the EU. If disbursements fall below this threshold, no additional duties will be imposed, which is intended to reduce administrative burdens and costs for the EU. This change aligns with EU trade policies by maintaining compliance with WTO obligations while promoting efficient resource use.

The proposal is part of the EU's common commercial policy, an area of exclusive competence for the Union. It is considered proportionate as it avoids unnecessary administrative costs when retaliation is negligible. Historically, the U.S. was authorized to suspend tariff concessions under the WTO due to non-compliance with the Byrd Amendment, leading to a 4.3% ad valorem additional customs duty on certain U.S. imports. However, recent data shows a negligible level of nullification or impairment, resulting in a 0% additional import duty to avoid disproportionate administrative costs.

Given the effective repeal of the Byrd Amendment in 2007 and the continued low level of nullification or impairment, the proposal suggests amending existing regulations to include a de minimis threshold. Financially, the proposal is deemed to have no significant impact. The maximum potential",

a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions as regards requirements for securities financing transactions under the net stable funding ratio  (Text with EEA relevance)  {SWD(2025) 77 final}  EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM  1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  This proposal aims to amend Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (Capital Requirements Regulation or CRR) to maintain the current transitional approach to the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) requirement.  The NSFR requirement is part of the Basel III international standards, which the European Union (EU) agreed to implement as part of the wide-ranging reform of the prudential framework for banks in the aftermath of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis (GFC). The NSFR requirement aims to ensure that banks have stable funding sources to fund their activities and reduce their dependency on short-term wholesale funding. It was designed to mitigate maturity transformation risk, as a globally consistent regulatory requirement, aiming to foster convergence across jurisdictions and eliminate opportunities for cross-border regulatory arbitrage.  In particular, the Basel NSFR standard introduces a minimum requirement on the amount of stable funding that banks must issue to finance their activities, based on the liquidity profile of their assets. It mitigates a bank’s liquidity risk by setting a required stable funding (RSF) level based on the bank’s assets, which is then compared to the available stable funding (ASF) that results from their liability instruments.  Securities Financing Transactions ( SFT s) as defined u nder Article 4(1 ), point 139 of the CRR encompass different secured transaction types in which assets (collateral) are exchanged for cash: (i) rep urchase (rep os ) and reverse-repurchase (reverse-repos) , (ii) securities lending , (iii) buy-sell-back , and (iv) margin lending. Repos and reverse-repos make up the largest share of SFTs, account ing for 68% of the total, followed by securities lending ( 23% ) , buy-sell-back ( 8% ) , and margin lending ( 1% ) (September 2023 data) 1 .  A repo is a collateralised and generally short-term borrowing transaction. A reverse-repo is a collateralised lending transaction, mirroring a repo transaction, where a bank (the lender) temporarily purchases securities or commodities (i.e. collateral) from a counterparty (the borrower) in exchange for cash with a commitment to sell the collateral back in the future at a predetermined price.  Unsecured lending transactions are loans that are not secured by any collateral. They are based on the borrower’s creditworthiness and promise to repay. They were mainly found on the interbank markets before the GFC.  Since the GFC and the closure of the unsecured interbank markets, SFTs have play ed a crucial role in the circulation of short-term funding between banks and market players through collateralised transactions. SFT market activity also links the short-term money market to the longer-term capital market. The bulk of SFTs are collateralised by sovereign debt. SFT s are characterised as a high-volume, low-margin business activity for large banks, and th is wholesale market activity is prone to international competition as highlighted by the very cross-border nature of these transactions . Only 41% of the EU SFT amount s are between EU counterparties , meanwhile 59% of the EU SFT amount s involve one non-EU counterparty 2 .  For monies due from SFTs with maturities up to six months, the Basel NSFR standard requires a conservative non-zero RSF requirement on banks. The objective is to discourage excessive short-term exposures between banks, which may give rise to contagion during times of financial distress.  The NSFR standard was implemented in EU law on 20 May 2019 through an amendment of the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR2). The related requirements entered into application at the end of June 2021. In its proposal amending the CRR, published on 23 November 2016 3 , the Commission suggested the permanent use of RSF levels low e r than those included in the Basel accord . The Commission concluded at the time that ‘ it seems reasonable to bring limited changes to the treatment of both short-term transactions with financial institutions, and of HQLA Level 1 [ in order ] not to hinder the good functioning of EU financial and repo markets ’ . The arguments and analysis that led to this approach and the impact assessment accompanying the Commission proposal are still valid 4 .  The co-legislators , however, allowed for a transitional 0% RSF requirement – instead of the 10% RSF specified in the Basel III standards and the lower one (5%) proposed by the Commission – for monies due from SFTs with maturities up to six months , when collateralised with Level 1 High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) 5 , such as sovereign debt. This provision is set to expire in June 2025, when the non-zero RSF requirement set out in the Basel standard would start to apply. The transitional provision aimed to give banks sufficient time to adapt to the more conservative requirement imposed by the Basel standards and to mitigate any consequential effect on the EU capital market, and in particular on the sovereign debt market.  Similar transitional provisions were also agreed for short-term monies due from SFTs collateralised by assets other than Level 1 HQLA and for short-term unsecured transactions with financial customers. These exposures are relatively less material compared to monies due from SFTs collateralised by Level 1 HQLA. They are also characterised by higher margins. The considerations of the co-legislators when granting a transitional treatment for these transactions were their inherent funding characteristics and the impact of the level of RSF factors for these transactions on the market liquidity, especially of assets received as collateral in SFT transactions.  The transitional prudential charge defined by co-legislators maintains a difference in the stable funding requirement that is consistent with the Basel standard, between monies due from SFTs collateralised by Level 1 HQLA, such as sovereign bonds, and monies due from SFTs collateralised by other assets. It contributes however not to increase the pressure on very high-quality collateral, beyond addressing the sovereign-bank nexus. It also supports the market liquidity and the diversity of collateral assets eligible to the liquidity buffer of banks, under the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR).  As regards unsecured funding transactions with a residual maturity below six months, with financial customers, the transitional treatment aims to apply a proportionate funding requirement to these transactions, in line with their funding risk profile, and to support the revive of the unsecured funding market that vanished after the 2008 GFC. Unsecured funding transactions should indeed be considered as a necessary complement to secured funding transactions such as SFTs, to support overall market liquidity and monetary policy transmission, in particular during periods of monetary policy tightening.  The United States , the United Kingdom , Japan and Switzerland have adopted a similar treatment as the EU’s transitional treatment, but these countries have made it a permanent one . The US agencies argue that ‘ the 0% RSF factor assignment was made based on the determination that Level 1 HQLA pose minimal liquidity risk and contribute importantly to the good functioning of short-term funding markets, i.e. that a non-zero RSF factor on Level 1 HQLA could discourage intermediation in US Treasury and repo markets ’ 6 .  The end of the current transitional treatment and the resulting tightening of the NSFR requirement in the EU raises some concerns. It could discourage EU banks from intermediating in government debt and reduce the liquidity in these markets because these high-volume low-margin transactions would become more costly. Further increasing the costs of these transactions when operated by EU counterparties, while 59% of EU transactions already involve one non-EU counterparty, may develop the attractiveness of non-EU counterparties or non-EU capital markets. This would contradict the development and sustainability of capital markets and liquidity for collateral assets, such as sovereign bonds, in the EU. If the EU was to increase the RSF factors for these transactions, in a unilateral way, it would distort the international level playing field, putting EU banks at a disadvantage compared to non-EU peers operating on this very international and competitive activity. Somehow, reinforcing the unlevel playing field would be at odd with one of the initial objectives of the Basel standards to support the implementation of globally consistent regulatory requirements and to reduce opportunities for cross border regulatory arbitrage.  Conversely, maintaining the current treatment, in line with the approach retained by other jurisdictions, may support the development of a liquid and attractive sovereign debt market and a deep SFT market for EU collateral instruments.  The current requirements have proven to be prudentially sound since their entry into application in mid-2021 and do not seem to have raised any financial stability concerns, in particular during the recent stress episodes (Russian aggression, UK Gilt crisis, March 2023 banking turmoil). Since mid-2021, EU banks have built up strong NSFR buffers, beyond minimum requirements, subject to an ongoing supervision by competent authorities. Any effect of maintaining the transitional treatment will continue to be monitored and subject to adequate supervisory scrutiny, including on banks’ funding practices and liquidity risk profile, through ongoing supervision and periodic reports.  Under Article 510(7) of the CRR2, the Commission is required to assess the relevance of the transitional NSFR treatment of monies due from SFTs and unsecured transactions, with financial customers, with a residual maturity below six months, by the end of June 2024, based on a report from the European Banking Authority (EBA). As explained in Section 3, the EBA’s report only analysed the impact on banks’ NSFR levels, that appears negligible. However, a broader analysis points to possible undesirable effects of moving towards the RSF prescribed by Basel accord. The EU’s SFT market plays a crucial role in financing EU government debt as the bulk of SFTs are collateralised by sovereign debt. In addition, maintaining the transitional treatment supports the liquidity and diversity of assets that are also eligible to the liquidity buffer of banks under the LCR. It may indeed not be appropriate to disconnect the two dimensions of the liquidity requirements.  It is also important to maintain the existing steps between the RSF factors for sovereign bonds collateral and other collateral used in SFTs as doing otherwise would affect the preference for one or the other, thereby risking reinforcing the pressure on (scarce) high quality collateral, beyond contributing to the sovereign-bank nexus.  The unsecured funding market for banks has vanished after the 2008 GFC and has never been revived, at least not to a significant level. A non-zero RSF factor already applies to short-term unsecured transactions under the NSFR. An increase in this factor will not materially strengthen the prudential profile of banks, i.e. the impact on the NSFR would be negligible, while it may disincentivise the use of unsecured funding transactions that may prove helpful in a period of monetary policy tightening.  An increase in the RSF level applicable to monies due from SFTs and unsecured transactions could discourage EU banks from intermediating in government debt and other collateral and reduce liquidity in the EU capital markets overall. An increase in the RSF for these transactions will not lead to a material change in the average level of the NSFR ratio of EU banks that already appears above the minimum requirements and is already subject to an ongoing supervision by competent authorities. It will therefore not change fundamentally the prudential profile of EU banks. This, in turn, could increase funding costs for Member States and EU market players in a period of normalised monetary policy when central banks are expected to reduce their market presence and private market players are expected to take over.  To avoid possible unintended consequences on capital markets liquidity and considering the safeguards provided by the current framework for banks, the Commission proposes to maintain the transitional treatment for monies due from SFT and for unsecured transactions with a residual maturity of less than six months, with financial customers. In addition to the ongoing monitoring of capital market developments by central banks and to the ongoing supervision by competent authorities, the Commission also proposes to mandate the EBA to report the impact of this treatment every 5 years. This would allow the Commission to act accordingly and propose amendments if evidence emerges from these periodic monitoring reports.  · Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  Under Article 510(7) of the CRR, the co-legislators explicitly require the Commission to submit a legislative proposal, where appropriate. This proposal must take into account both the impact of the existing treatment on institutions’ NSFR and the funding risk associated with SFTs and unsecured transactions with a residual maturity of less than six months, with financial customers. The Commission’s mandate also includes maintaining the international level playing field in this area, which is particularly prone to international competition.  Maintaining the NSFR transitional treatment set out in Article 428r(1)(g), Article 428s(1)(b) and Article 428v(a) of the CRR is in line with this mandate.  First, while EU banks present adequate NSFR buffers above their minimum requirements and benefit from an ongoing supervision of their funding capacity, maintaining the transitional treatment will support the development of liquid capital markets in the EU and the availability of a diversified pool of eligible liquid assets under the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR). SFT transactions support the swift and orderly transformation of securities into cash at an economical price, thereby being a key element for the monetisation of liquidity pools. A negatively affected SFT market could endanger the effectiveness of the LCR, whose logic is to have a buffer of liquid assets that can be easily transformed into cash through SFTs or sold on markets, in case of a 30-day liquidity stress scenario.  Then, more broadly, maintaining the transitional treatment will keep the EU funding requirements aligned with other key jurisdictions and avoid an unilateral departure from the international consensus that may affect the level playing field for EU banks. A permanent approach will also give the necessary legal certainty to stakeholders in relation to the perennity and the stability of their business activities.  Finally, this approach – based on a periodic report by the EBA – also enables the Commission to propose amendments if evidence emerges supporting such amendments.  • Consistency with other Union policies  The proposed amendment to the CRR aims to preserve SFT market activity and the liquidity of sovereign debt markets in the EU, which will contribute to the efficiency of the EU banking and capital markets without undermining financial stability.  The assessment of the degree of alignment with international prudential standards, equally considered with its impact on the economy led to consider that the current transitional treatment did not lead to significant financial stability concerns, as illustrated in particular by the recent stress episodes (Russian aggression, UK Gilt crisis, March 2023 banking turmoil) that did not unveil heightened concerns in terms of funding risk at EU banks. While the end of the transitional treatment would not significantly affect the prudential profile of banks, it may negatively alter market liquidity, in particular on the sovereign debt market.  Maintaining the current transitional treatment on a steady state with regular reporting and ongoing supervision by competent authorities will provide legal certainty to market participants, thereby supporting the perennity and stability of their business activities. A stable prudential treatment for monies due from SFTs and unsecured transactions would also contribute to the stability of the reporting framework for banks, as a change of scope would require an adjustment of the dedicated templates.  Beyond maintaining the transitional treatment for SFTs collateralised by sovereign debt, continuing the transitional treatment for monies due from SFTs collateralised by other assets will support the diversification of banks’ liquidity buffers and the mitigation of the sovereign-bank nexus.  Keeping the RSF factor that applies since June 2021 to short-term unsecured transactions with financial customers will contribute to the use of these transactions in a context of monetary policy tightening, as a complement to secured transactions. This would in turn support overall capital markets liquidity and ultimately an adequate financing of the real economy.  By safeguarding the level playing field between the EU and other major jurisdiction that have already implemented, on a permanent basis, a similar NSFR prudential treatment, the proposed amendment will contribute to support the competitiveness and attractiveness of EU capital markets and the intermediation role of EU banks. Active EU intermediaries on SFT markets and deep liquid EU markets for collateral assets, such as sovereign bonds, ultimately contribute to lower funding costs for the overall EU economy.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  The proposed amendments are built on the same legal basis (Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)) as the legislative acts that are being amended.  • Subsidiarity  Under the principle of subsidiarity set out in Article 5(3) of the Treaty on the European Union, ‘in areas which do not fall within its executive competence, the Union shall act only if and in so far as the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, either at central level or at regional level and local level, but can rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved at Union level.’  Given that the objective of the proposed measure aims to amend existing EU legislation, it is best achieved at EU level rather than through different national initiatives. In fact, adopting national measures would be difficult from a legal standpoint, given that the CRR is directly applicable and already regulates banking liquidity and funding prudential requirements at national level.  In the banking sector, where many institutions operate across the EU single market, it is particularly important to ensure a standard application of prudential requirements, the convergence of supervisory practices and a level playing field for banking services.  • Proportionality  Under the principle of proportionality, the content and form of EU action should not exceed what is necessary to achieve the objectives of the Treaties.  The goals of the proposals are to ensure the competitiveness and the attractiveness of the EU economy through effective capital markets for SFTs, sovereign bond and other collateral assets, without creating additional financial stability risks for EU banks.  Under this proposal, the ability of EU banks to comply with NSFR requirement with substantive prudential buffers is maintained without excessively increasing their dependence on short-term funding.  In addition, the proposed amendments do not go beyond the scope of the transitional measures set out in Article 510(8) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. All other liquidity requirements imposed under Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 remain unchanged.  • Choice of the instrument  The measures are proposed to be implemented by amending the CRR. The proposed measures refer to or further develop existing provisions set out in the CRR. No other legal instrument would be possible.  3. RESULTS OF EX POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  Not applicable. The proposed amendment relates to a specific action in line with the Commission’s mandate, set out in Article 510(7) of the CRR, to submit a legislative proposal to address a very targeted aspect of the CRR (i.e. the RSF factors applicable to securities financing transactions and unsecured transactions, with a residual maturity of less than six months, with financial customers). This initiative is not an evaluation or revision of the CRR in its entirety.  • Stakeholder consultations  The Commission has taken several steps and carried out various initiatives to assess whether the current transitional treatment is still adequate for securities financing transactions and unsecured transactions with a residual maturity of less than six months, with financial customers, in light of the objectives of the prudential framework for banks and the EU’s broader policy objectives.  The Commission took into consideration the EBA report on specific aspects of the net stable funding ratio framework, which was published on 16 January 2024 and fulfils the requirement set out in Article 510(6) of the CRR 7 . However, t he EBA report did not cover all the relevant dimensions surrounding the issue , such as the impacts on monetary policy transmission , on sovereign bond markets and on other collateral markets . I t has been one element in the broader policy analysis carried out by the Commission.  The Commission discussed and exchanged views with various industry participants, supervisors and the European Central Bank (ECB).  The Commission also participated and contributed to the dedicated discussions of the s ub c ommittee of the Economic and Financial Committee on EU Sovereign Debt Markets , which re p resent s the views of Member States’ debt management offices. Members of the subcommittee reiterated the concerns reflected in Recital s 49 and 50 of the CRR 2 8 that SFTs are key tools for the transmission of monetary policy and are critical instruments for the primary and secondary market of sovereign debt . Increasing the prudential charge for SFTs would , according to the Members of the subcommittee, impact the level-playing field between EU and non- EU capital market - players and potentially affect negatively the liquidity and the cost of borrowing in European sovereign debt markets .  The Commission has considered the concerns raised publicly by three Member States on this issue 9 . EU SFT transactions are predominantly concentrated in a few Member States, with France being the primary domicile holding 55% of EU SFT borrowing in September 2023. Other counterparties are German (holding 17% of EU SFT borrowing), Italian (7%) and Irish (5%). This concentration may be explained by the central role of Central Counterparty Clearing Houses (CCPs) (LCH, EuroNext Clearing and EUREX Clearing) and banks domiciled in those Member States and acting as clearing members. F inancial institutions concentrate their exposures in Member States where CCPs operate for more efficient risk management and clearing. CCPs contribute to 20% of SFTs, using SFTs in their cash reinvestment strategy.  The European Commission published between 10 February and 10 March 2025 a call for evidence on its intention to amend the CRR on the prudential treatment of short-term SFTs for the purpose of the NSFR. A detailed summary is developed in the staff working document accompanying the proposal.  All these exchanges and consultations have highlighted the critical importance of efficient EU SFT, unsecured fundings and government bond markets at a time when the ECB is committed to changes to its monetary policy that gradually relies more on the SFTs and unsecured financial transactions markets to redistribute liquidity among financial intermediaries. Members states, debt management offices, banks and capital market intermediaries have called on the Commission to amend the current rules and maintain the transitional treatment.  • Collection and use of expertise  In addition to what is mentioned in the previous section, the Commission has maintained regular contact with staff in the EBA, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) and the ECB.  • Impact assessment  The EBA report on specific aspects of the Net Stable Funding Ratio framework finds that the end of the transitional measure would only have a limited impact on the average NSFR level of EU banks.  However, this limited impact conceals a more significant impact on banks that are more active in the capital markets. Moreover, some of these banks might also have a smaller management buffer because, in general, the NSFR is conservatively calibrated for these activities. The constant balance sheet assumption in the EBA report, which is based on the assumption that bank behaviour is not affected when minimum requirements are met, may not necessarily be appropriate. This is because it leaves out possible dynamic and behavioural impacts linked to a bank’s attempt to achieve a given target NSFR. The report also overlooks that non-EU banks may gain market share over EU banks based on an uneven international playing field.  An increase in the RSF level applicable to monies due from SFTs could discourage EU banks from intermediating in government debt and affect the liquidity in the collateral markets concerned. This could also lead to higher bid-ask spreads and an increase in funding costs for Member States in a period of normalised monetary policy when central banks are expected to reduce their market presence and private market players are expected to take over.  The possible implications for EU SFT and government bond market activity will depend on the extent to which banks can pass on an increase in the RSF factors to bid-ask spreads in the SFT market. The market-making role of the banks most affected may indicate a rather high or even a full pass-through of the regulatory cost. At the same time, banks might also have an incentive to limit this pass-through as it might attract competition from non-EU banks.  Any increase in the funding charge linked to the RSF level could have potential consequences for the liquidity of the sovereign debt markets, with implications for the liquidity of NextGenerationEU bonds. This would confirm the concerns raised at the time of the CRR2 proposal 10 .  The impact on non-EU banks operating in the EU SFT market is less clear. The activities concerned are normally carried out by EU subsidiaries, which would be subject to the same NSFR requirements than the one that apply to EU banks. However, they might be able to shift those activities to branches or cross-border operations, and, in any case, they would be able to back-to-back the activity with support from their parent company to neutralise the increase. In short, non-EU banking groups in certain jurisdictions could possibly neutralise the impact of an increase in the NSFR, considering that they would not face similar prudential requirements on these exposures after June 2025. This situation would, without specific EU action, lead to an uneven international playing field.  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  This initiative is very specific and targeted. As a result, it does not affect regulatory fitness or simplification.  • Fundamental rights  The EU is committed to high standards of protection of fundamental rights and is a signatory to a broad set of conventions on human rights. The proposal is not expected to have a direct impact on the rights listed in the main UN conventions on human rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which is an integral part of the EU Treaties and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  The proposal does not have implications for the EU budget.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  Beyond the regular capital market monitoring, supervisory reviews, stress testing exercises and data collection carried out by central banks and supervisory authorities, including at EU level, the proposal sets out that the EBA will also monitor the effects of the amendments on banks’ NSFR and the liquidity of the underlying collateral markets every five years. The development of the periodic monitoring report should not introduce an additional reporting burden on EU banks as it could rely on available market intelligence and existing supervisory reporting requirements.  • Explanatory documents (for directives)  Not applicable.  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  Article 1 deletes the transitional provision set out in Article 510(8) of the CRR in order to maintain the existing treatment for monies due from SFTs and unsecured transactions with a residual maturity of less than six months, with financial customers. Article 1 also amends Article 510(6) in order to introduce a periodic monitoring where the EBA is mandated to report to the Commission every five years on the appropriateness of the treatment. Article 510(7) becomes redundant and is therefore deleted.  2025/0077 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions as regards requirements for securities financing transactions under the net stable funding ratio  (Text with EEA relevance)  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank ( 11 ) ,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee ( 12 ) ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) Regulation (EU) 2019/876 of the European Parliament and of the Council 13 introduced into Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council 14 the N et S table F unding R atio (NSFR) requirement . That requirement reflect ed part of the Basel III standards, i.e. the international standards agreed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) which were developed to ensure that credit institutions have sufficient stable funding on a one-year horizon , and thus to prevent an excessive maturity mismatch between assets and liabilities and an overreliance on short-term wholesale funding. The NSFR requirement as laid down in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 has been applicable to credit institutions since 28 June 2021.  (2) Article 428r(1), point (g), Article 428s(1), point (b) , and Article 428v, point (a), of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 currently provide for the stable funding factors for monies due from financing transactions with financial customers, where those transactions have a residual maturity of less than six months. Those funding factors are, depending on the financing transaction concerned, 0%, 5% or 10%. Article 510 (8) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 , however, provides for a raise , by 28 June 2025 , of th ose funding factors to 10%, 15% a nd 15%, respectively. Th at deferred raise aimed at giving credit institutions sufficient time to gradually adapt to a more conservative calibration and to assess whether th at calibration was appropriate. In addition to that deferred raise , other adjustments were adopted to ensure that the introduction of the NSFR requirement did not disrupt the liquidity of the related collateral markets, including sovereign bonds markets.  (3) Under Article 510(6), of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, t he European Banking Authority (EBA) was mandated to assess the appropriateness of the treatment of the stable funding required to cover the funding risk linked to SFT s and unsecured transactions with financial customers where those SFTs and unsecured transactions have a residual maturity of less than six months. In line with th at mandate, the EBA delivered a report on specific aspects of the NSFR on 16 January 202 4 15 Th at report conclude d that a raise of the funding factors, as provided for in Article 510(8) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, would have a negligible impact on the levels of NSFR s of institutions. However, the report does not assess the broader dimension and spillover effects on the liquidity of the sovereign debt and bonds markets. T he considerations that led to the deferral of that raise still prevail. In particular, as the bulk of SFT s are collateralised by sovereign debt instruments, a raise in the related required stable funding could reduce the liquidity in the markets concerned . Th at could , in turn, risk creating additional funding costs for Member States and altering monetary policy transmission mechanisms.  (4) In addition, other BCBS member jurisdictions have set required stable funding levels for SFT s that are identical to those that are currently applicable . In th at context, given the intense international competition in the SFT market , a raise of the funding factors on 28 June 2025 would create an un even international playing field that would be detrimental to U nion financial markets.  (5) To avoid th o se unintended consequences, the current stable funding factors for SFT s and unsecured transactions with financial customers, where such transactions have a residual maturity of less than six months, as laid down in Article 428r(1), point (g), Article 428s(1), point (b), and Article 428v, point (a), of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 , should be made permanent.  (6) To ensure sufficient monitoring of the interactions with the market liquidity of assets received as collateral in SFTs and unsecured transactions with financial customers, where such transactions have a residual maturity of less than six months, including when collateralized by sovereign debt, the funding risk for credit institutions, and possible international developments in that area, the EBA should report to the European Commission every five years on the appropriateness of those stable funding requirements .  (7) To ensure the continuity of the prudential treatment for monies due f rom SFT s and for unsecured transactions, with financial customers , with a residual maturity of less than six months, as specified under Article 428r(1), point (g), Article 428s(1), point (b), and Article 428v, point (a), of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, the proposed Regulation should apply from 29 June 2025. Temporarily discontinuing the treatment would create legal uncertainty for market participants and undue administrative and financial burden for the Union bank ing sector in general that could be mitigated by clearly setting the expected date of application of the provisions concerned .  (8) Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 should therefore be amended accordingly ,  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Article 1 Amendments to Regulation (EU) No 575/2013  Article 510 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 is amended as follows:  (1) paragraph 6 is amended as follows:  (a) the first subparagraph is replaced by the following:  ‘The EBA shall monitor the amount of stable funding required to cover the funding risk linked to securities financing transactions, including the assets received or given in those transactions, and to unsecured transactions, with financial customers, where such transactions have a residual maturity of less than six months. The EBA shall report to the Commission by 31 January 2029, and every five years thereafter, on the appropriateness of that requirement. Taking into account international developments and the regulatory treatment of similar transactions in other jurisdictions, the reports shall assess at a minimum:’;  (b) point s (d) and (e) are replaced by the following :  ‘(d) the adequacy of the asymmetric treatment between liabilities with a residual maturity of less than six months provided by financial customers that are subject to a 0 % available stable funding factor in accordance with Article 428k(3) , point (c), and assets resulting from transactions with a residual maturity of less than six months with financial customers that are subject to a 0 %, 5 % or 10 % required stable funding factor in accordance with Article 428r(1), point (g), Article 428s(1) , point (b), and Article 428v , point (a) ;  (e) the impact of the introduction of higher or lower required stable funding factors for securities financing transactions, in particular with a residual maturity of less than six months , with financial customers, on:  (i) the price structure of those transactions ; and  (ii) the market liquidity of assets received as collateral in those transactions, in particular of sovereign and corporate bonds; ’ ;  (2) p aragraph s 7 and 8 are deleted .  Article 2 Entry into force and application  This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union .  This Regulation shall apply from 29 June 2025.  This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in the Member States in accordance with the Treaties.

FRAMEWORK OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE  1.1. Title of the proposal/initiative  Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions as regards requirements for securities financing transactions under the net stable funding ratio.  1.2. Policy area(s) concerned  Financial stability and financial services.  1.3. Objective(s)  1.3.1. General objective(s)  There are two general objectives: (i) maintain an adequate and efficient functioning of the SFT and collateral markets, in particular sovereign debt markets; and (ii) maintain an international level playing field, in line with the objectives of the Basel standards.  1.3.2. Specific objective(s)  Associated with the two general objectives are three specific objectives: (i) ensure that the liquidity and the cost structure of SFT and collateral markets remain appropriate; (ii) avoid an undue increase in funding costs for EU banks and Member States on short-term funding markets; and (ii) ensure the consistency of the required stable funding treatment in the EU with other large jurisdictions.  1.3.3. Expected result(s) and impact  Specify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.  The proposal contributes to: (i) ensuring adequate liquidity flows between banks and market players through collateralised transactions in the EU; (ii) maintaining the international level playing field for EU banks; and (iii) stabilising funding costs for EU banks and Member States.  1.3.4. Indicators of performance  Specify the indicators for monitoring progress and achievements.  The Commission proposes a mandate for the European Banking Authority to monitor, review and report to the Commission every five years, in particular on the impact of the proposed measure on the market liquidity of assets received as collateral in SFTs.  1.4. The proposal/initiative relates to:   a new action   a new action following a pilot project / preparatory action 16   the extension of an existing action   a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action  1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative  1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative  The initiative proposes to make the current treatment permanent for securities financing transactions and unsecured transactions with a residual maturity of less than six months, with financial customers. The current treatment is set to end on 28 June 2025. As such, it does not impose new requirements on EU banks. The entry into application of the proposed measure should be as close as possible to 28 June 2025.  1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, greater effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this section ‘ added value of EU involvement ’ is the value resulting from EU action, that is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.  Reasons for action at EU level ( ex-ante ) – Given that the proposed measure aims to amend existing EU legislation, it is best achieved at EU level rather than through different national initiatives. To achieve the EU single market’s objectives, it is crucial to ensure a standard application of the proposed measure, a convergence of related supervisory practices and a level playing field throughout the single market for banking services.  Expected generated EU added value ( ex post ) – Adopting national measures would be difficult from a legal standpoint given that the CRR is directly applicable and already regulates banking liquidity and funding prudential requirements at national level. In addition, a minimum degree of harmonisation and consistency across Member States is necessary to achieve the single market’s objectives.  1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past  The CRR is directly applicable across the EU and already regulates banking liquidity and funding prudential requirements in all Member States. This ensures a standard application of prudential measures, the necessary convergence in supervisory practices and a level playing field throughout the single market for banking services, forming the basis for sound competition across the EU.  1.5.4. Compatibility with the multiannual financial framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments  Not applicable for this proposal – no budgetary impact.  1.5.5. Assessment of the different available financing options, including scope for redeployment  Not applicable for this proposal – no budgetary impact.  1.6. Duration of the proposal/initiative and of its financial impact   limited duration  –  in effect from [DD/MM]YYYY to [DD/MM]YYYY  –  financial impact from YYYY to YYYY for commitment appropriations and from YYYY to YYYY for payment appropriations.   unlimited duration  – Implementation with a start-up period from YYYY to YYYY,  – followed by full-scale operation.  1.7. Method(s) of budget implementation planned 17   Direct management by the Commission  –  by its departments, including by its staff in the Union delegations;  –  by the executive agencies   Shared management with the Member States   Indirect management by entrusting budget implementation tasks to:  –  third countries or the bodies they have designated  –  international organisations and their agencies (to be specified)  –  the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund  –  bodies referred to in Articles 70 and 71 of the Financial Regulation  –  public law bodies  –  bodies governed by private law with a public service mission to the extent that they are provided with adequate financial guarantees  –  bodies governed by the private law of a Member State that are entrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership and that are provided with adequate financial guarantees  –  bodies or persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in the common foreign and security policy pursuant to Title V of the Treaty on European Union, and identified in the relevant basic act  –   bodies established in a Member State, governed by the private law of a Member State or Union law and eligible to be entrusted, in accordance with sector-specific rules, with the implementation of Union funds or budgetary guarantees, to the extent that such bodies are controlled by public law bodies or by bodies governed by private law with a public service mission, and are provided with adequate financial guarantees in the form of joint and several liability by the controlling bodies or equivalent financial guarantees and which may be, for each action, limited to the maximum amount of the Union support.

of 17 June 2025
amending Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 as regards requirements for securities financing transactions under the net stable funding ratio
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee(2),
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure(3),
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EU) 2019/876 of the European Parliament and of the Council(4)introduced into Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council(5)the net stable funding ratio (NSFR) requirement for credit institutions. That requirement reflected part of the Basel III standards agreed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), which were developed to ensure that credit institutions have sufficient stable funding on a one-year horizon, and thus to prevent an excessive maturity mismatch between assets and liabilities and an overreliance on short-term wholesale funding. The NSFR requirement has been applicable since 28 June 2021.
(2) Article 428r(1), point (g), Article 428s(1), point (b), and Article 428v, point (a), of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 currently provide for the stable funding factors for monies due from financing transactions with financial customers, where those transactions have a residual maturity of less than six months. Those funding factors are, depending on the financing transaction concerned, 0 %, 5 % or 10 %. However, Article 510(8) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 provides that, by 28 June 2025, those funding factors are to be raised to 10 %, 15 % and 15 %, respectively. That deferred raise aimed to give credit institutions sufficient time to gradually adapt to a more conservative calibration and to assess whether that calibration was appropriate. In addition to that deferred raise, other adjustments were adopted to ensure that the introduction of the NSFR requirement did not disrupt the liquidity of the related collateral markets, including sovereign bond markets.
(3) Under Article 510(6) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, the European Supervisory Authority (European Banking Authority) (EBA) established by Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council(6), was mandated to assess the appropriateness of the treatment of the stable funding required to cover the funding risk linked to securities financing transactions (SFTs) and to unsecured transactions with financial customers where those SFTs or unsecured transactions have a residual maturity of less than six months. In line with that mandate, EBA delivered a report on specific aspects of the NSFR framework on 16 January 2024. That report concluded that raising the required stable funding factors applying to the transactions referred to in Article 428r(1), point (g), Article 428s(1), point (b), and Article 428v, point (a), of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 would have a negligible impact on the NSFR levels of credit institutions. However, that report did not assess the broader dimension or spillover effects regarding the liquidity of the sovereign debt markets and the effects on sovereign bond markets. Therefore, the considerations justifying the deferral of the raising of required stable funding factors, as provided for in Article 510(8) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, continue to prevail. In particular, as the bulk of SFTs are collateralised by sovereign debt instruments, a raise in the related required stable funding could reduce the liquidity in the markets concerned. That could, in turn, risk creating additional funding costs for Member States and altering monetary policy transmission mechanisms.
(4) In addition, other BCBS member jurisdictions have set required stable funding factor levels for SFTs that are identical to those that are currently applicable under Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. In that context, given the intense international competition in the SFT market, raising the required stable funding factors by 28 June 2025 would create an uneven international playing field that would be detrimental to Union financial markets.
(5) To avoid those unintended consequences, the current stable funding factors for SFTs and for unsecured transactions with financial customers, where such transactions have a residual maturity of less than six months, should be made permanent.
(6) To ensure sufficient monitoring of interactions between the stable funding requirements and the market liquidity of assets received as collateral in SFTs and of unsecured transactions with financial customers, where such transactions have a residual maturity of less than six months, including when collateralised by sovereign debt, the funding risk for credit institutions, and possible international developments in that area, EBA should report to the Commission every five years on the appropriateness of those stable funding requirements.
(7) Temporarily discontinuing the prudential treatment for monies due from SFTs and for unsecured transactions with financial customers, with a residual maturity of less than six months, would create legal uncertainty for market participants and undue administrative and financial burden for the Union banking sector in general that could be mitigated by clearly setting the expected date of application of the provisions concerned. Therefore, to ensure the continuity of that prudential treatment, this amending Regulation should apply from 29 June 2025.
(8) Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 should therefore be amended accordingly,

Article 2

This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in theOfficial Journal of the European Union.
It shall apply from 29 June 2025.
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.
Done at Strasbourg, 17 June 2025.",https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202501215,,"The European Parliament and the Council have adopted a regulation amending capital requirements for banks, specifically addressing securities financing transactions (SFTs) and their impact on the net stable funding ratio (NSFR). The NSFR is a measure designed to ensure that banks maintain a stable funding base relative to their assets and activities, thereby reducing their reliance on short-term funding. Initially, there was a proposal to increase stable funding factors for certain short-term transactions to encourage more conservative funding practices. However, the European Banking Authority determined that such changes would have minimal impact on banks' NSFR levels but could negatively affect the liquidity of sovereign debt markets and create funding challenges for member states. As a result, the regulation maintains the current stable funding factors for these transactions indefinitely. To ensure legal certainty and minimize administrative burdens, the regulation will take effect on June 29, 2025. The European Banking Authority is tasked with monitoring the stable funding required for SFTs and unsecured transactions with financial customers with a residual maturity of less than six months. They will report to the Commission by January 31, 2029, and every five years thereafter, assessing the appropriateness of these requirements in light of international developments and the regulatory treatment of similar transactions in other jurisdictions. This includes evaluating the impact of stable funding factors on the price structure of transactions and the market liquidity of assets received as collateral, particularly sovereign and corporate bonds.

REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  on the modification of customs duties applicable to imports of certain goods originating in or exported directly or indirectly from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus  EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM  1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  The purpose of the present proposal for a r egulation , in line with the European Council conclusions of 17 October 2024 1 , is to increase the customs duties applicable to imports of certain agricultural goods that are currently classified under Chapters 1, 2, 4 to 24, 29, 33, 35, 38, 41, 43, 50, 51, 52 and 53 of the Combined Nomenclature (CN) as well as of certain fertilisers currently classified under Chapter 31 of the CN, originating in or exported directly or indirectly from the Russian Federation or the Republic of Belarus. The proposal significantly and with immediate effect increases the applicable import tariffs for th e agricultural goods from the Russian Federation or the Republic of Belarus, while the tariff increases for the fertilisers will tak e place gradually , over a transition period of three years. In addition, those goods that originat e in or are exported directly or indirectly from the Russian Federation or the Republic of Belarus would be barred from access to the Union’s tariff rate quotas.  In 2023, Union imports of the agricultural goods from the Russian Federation covered by the proposed regulation (‘the concerned agricultural goods’) amounted to 2.9 million tonnes, with a value of EUR 380 million (according to Eurostat data). The Union’s erga omnes tariffs (i.e. the currently applied most-favoured-nation tariffs) on those concerned agricultural goods vary greatly. No trade is taking place in agricultural goods that already incur high most-favoured-nation tariffs. By contrast, agricultural goods from the Russian Federation that incur no or only relatively low most-favoured-nation tariffs are still being imported into the Union because there is no substantial most-favoured-nation tariff barrier to their entry into the Union’s market.  In 2023, the types of fertilisers covered by the proposed regulation (‘the concerned fertilisers’) represented over 70% of overall fertiliser consumption in the Union. According to Eurostat, imports from all third countries amounted to 14 million tonnes, and these included imports from the Russian Federation that amounted to 3.6 million tonnes (worth EUR 1.28 billion) – so over 25% of the Union’s total imports (by tonnage). Union producers meet the rest of the Union’s demand for these types of fertilisers, and the Union’s exports to the rest of the world of these products totalled 8 million tonnes in 2023. For all the concerned fertilisers, the Union’s erga omnes tariffs (i.e. the currently applied most-favoured-nation tariffs) are set at 6.5%, which is a low rate and not a significant hindrance to importing them from the Russian Federation into the Union.  The current importation of the concerned agricultural goods and fertilisers constitutes a dependency on the Russian Federation which could, if not addressed, impair the Union’s food security and, especially in the case of fertilisers, make the Union particularly vulnerable to potential coercive actions of the Russian Federation. Imports of the concerned fertilisers from the Russian Federation are already increasing and this increase could accelerate if significant volumes are re-oriented to the Union, given that the Russian Federation produces very large volumes of the concerned fertilisers. Such potential increased imports from the Russian Federation would disrupt the Union’s market in those goods and harm the Union’s nitrogen fertilisers producers who are facing difficulties to compete with imports from the Russian Federation at a time when gas prices in the Union remain high. The long-term survival of the Union’s nitrogen fertiliser industry is crucial for the Union’s food security because the fertilisers in question are essential for plant growth and play a critical role in maintaining the ability of the Union’s agricultural sector to produce food. Therefore, addressing the growing dependency on imports of the concerned fertilisers from the Russian Federation and preserving the viability of an autonomous Union nitrogen fertiliser industry is vital to ensuring and maintaining the Union’s food security. The present level of imports of the concerned agricultural goods is not comparable with that for the concerned fertilisers, but the current state of relations between the Union and the Russian Federation means that dependency should be prevented from developing in the future. However, it is not possible to ensure that this does not happen if the tariffs on concerned agricultural goods remain at present levels.  The proposed tariff measures would ensure that the Russian Federation does not benefit commercially from continuing to export to the Union. This would be consistent with the Union’s interests and with the Union’s law and policies, especially those applied towards the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus in the context of the Russian’s Federation’s unprovoked and unjustified aggression against Ukraine and the support which the Republic of Belarus continues to provide to thereof.  The Republic of Belarus exports limited quantities of the concerned agricultural goods and fertilisers (EUR 92 million of agricultural goods and EUR 29.6 million of fertilisers in 2023). It is therefore not an important producer or exporter of those goods. The scope of the proposed regulation nevertheless includes the Republic of Belarus due to its close political and economic ties to the Russian Federation and in order to prevent the illegal and fraudulent channelling of imports from the Russian Federation through the Republic of Belarus that could occur if the Union tariffs on imports of concerned goods originating in or imported from the Republic of Belarus were to remain unchanged. Given the continuing rapprochement and increasing trade between the Republic of Belarus and the Russian Federation, it is appropriate to treat the concerned goods from the Republic of Belarus in the same way as those from the Russian Federation.  The proposed regulation would increase tariffs for the concerned goods originating in or exported directly or indirectly from the Russian Federation or the Republic of Belarus to a level high enough to halt the importation of these goods. For all the concerned agricultural goods, tariffs on imports from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus to the Union would increase by an ad valorem duty of 50%. To avoid the entry of the concerned agricultural goods originating in or exported directly or indirectly from the Russian Federation or the Republic of Belarus into the Union market at the lower rates applicable under Union tariff rate quotas, it is also necessary to exclude goods originating in or exported directly or indirectly from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus from the application of reduced tariffs under those quotas. For the concerned fertilisers, on top of the existing ad valorem duty of 6.5%, the tariff would be subject to an additional specific duty that would gradually increase, starting at EUR 40 or EUR 45 per tonne, depending on the type of fertiliser (corresponding to approximately 13% in ad valorem equivalent), to a prohibitive level of EUR 315 or EUR 430 per tonne respectively, three years after the start of the proposed regulation’s application (a level of about 100% in ad valorem equivalent). Within the three-year transitional period, these prohibitive level tariffs will also be introduced in the event goods from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus are imported above certain specified volumes.  The proposed regulation is not expected to negatively affect global food security. Firstly, the increase in Union tariffs would apply only to imports into the Union and would therefore not affect the transit of the goods concerned from the Russian Federation or the Republic of Belarus through the Union territory to third countries. Secondly, the increase in the Union’s import duties is expected to substantially reduce the flows of these imports into the Union, thereby actually increasing the quantities of concerned goods available to third countries – and particularly to developing countries.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  The imposition of import tariff s on the goods concerned pertains to the Union’s Common Commercial Policy laid down in Article s 206 and 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union ( TFEU ) . It corresponds to ‘ change s in tariff rates ’ as provided for in Article 207(1) TFEU and builds on the option of denying most-favour ed -nation treatment to products originating in the Russian Federation that was reflected in the ‘ Joint Statement on Aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine with the support of Belarus ’ made by the Union and several other Members of the World Trade Organization in Geneva on 17 March 2022 2 . This h as already been put into practice in several regulations , including the regulation through which the Union has imposed higher tariff rates on imports of certain agricultural goods from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus 3 .  • Consistency with other Union policies  The proposed increases in customs duties on certain agricultural goods and fertilisers originating in or exported directly or indirectly from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus listed in this proposal would be consistent with the restrictive measures taken by the Union against these countries following the Russian Federation’s unprovoked and unjustified military aggression against Ukraine and the support which the Republic of Belarus continues to provide to the Russian Federation’s aggression. The tariffs increases in this proposed regulation would therefore comply with the requirement under Article 21(3) of the Treaty on European Union to ensure consistency between the different areas of the Union’s external action. They would also comply with Article 207(1) TFEU, which provides that the Common Commercial Policy is to be conducted in the context of the principles and objectives of the Union’s external actions.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  The legal basis for the proposal is Article 207(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  The Common Commercial Policy is, in accordance with Article 3(1)(e) of the TFEU, defined as an exclusive Union competence, so the subsidiarity principle does not apply.  • Proportionality  This proposed regulation is necessary in order to implement the Common Commercial Policy, with the objective of decreasing the Union’s imports from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus. This reduction is driven by concerns that these imports deepen the existing dependencies and therefore have a negative impact on the Union’s food security. The proposed regulation is consistent with the principle of proportionality and does not go beyond what is necessary in order to meet the objectives of the Treaties, in particular the need to ensure that the concerned agricultural goods and fertilisers originating in or exported directly or indirectly from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus do not disturb the Union market for those goods and the proper functioning of the Customs Union. Those goods should therefore not have access to the Union market on terms that are as favourable as the terms that apply to imports of such goods from other third countries. Proportionality is ensured by the fact that the proposed regulation would increase the Common Customs Tariff duties applicable to imports from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus and by the fact that this is necessary to limit such imports where the current tariffs are either set at zero or are low. The increase is necessary to reduce the ability of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus to weaponise their exports to the Union. The proposed increase of tariffs limits the exercise of certain fundamental rights, but does so only to the extent necessary to achieve its objectives.  • Choice of the instrument  This proposal is in accordance with Article 207(2) TFEU, which envisages Common Commercial Policy measures for enacting changes in tariff levels in the form of a regulation.  3. RESULTS OF EX POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex post evaluations / fitness checks of existing legislation  Not applicable.  • Stakeholder consultations  Not applicable.  • Collection and use of expertise  Not applicable.  • Impact assessment  In light of the current ability of the Russian Federation to use its export of certain agricultural goods and particularly the concerned fertilisers to destabilise the Union markets, negatively affect the Union’s food security and undermine the Union’s unity in supporting Ukraine; as well as in light of the Republic of Belarus’ support for the Russian Federation’s actions, it is important for the proposed regulation to enter into force urgently in order to increase as soon as possible the duty rates applicable to concerned goods from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus. No impact assessment has therefore been carried out for the proposed regulation. It is expected that the proposed measure will significantly reduce the importation into the Union of the concerned goods originating in or exported directly or indirectly from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus, and that this will result in further diversification of sourcing those goods away from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus.  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  The measure does not disproportionately increase the regulatory burden on companies and public authorities.  • Fundamental rights  The proposal is consistent with the Union’s human rights policy and with the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Where the imposition of import duties affects, in the Union, the freedom to engage in international trade as part of the freedom of professional activity, the right of property or other fundamental rights including equal treatment, this imposition can be considered a legitimate action by the Union that is in conformity with the Charter of Fundamental Rights. This is because this action is taken in conformity with the requirements for the action to be taken on the basis of a proper legal basis; by the competent authorities; and in pursuit of the legitimate objective of placing at a commercial disadvantage imports of certain goods from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus in order to foster diversification of supplies away from those two countries by promoting more Union domestic production and alternative imports from other third countries. The proposed regulation would also prevent serious disturbances of the relevant markets and weaponisation of exports of the concerned goods by the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus; and would ensure the proper functioning of the Union’s markets in a manner that would be consistent both with the Union’s current external action measures and with the principle of proportionality. Specifically, with regard to equal treatment, the fact that increased import duties are imposed on importers of certain agricultural goods and fertilisers originating in or exported directly or indirectly from the Russian Federation or the Republic of Belarus – but not on importers of goods that neither originate in nor are exported directly or indirectly from the Russian Federation or the Republic of Belarus – responds to one of the Union’s external action objectives. This is the Union’s legitimate policy objective of reducing such imports from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus, and of protecting the Union’s markets from an abuse of the trade in the concerned goods that is intended to destabilise the Union’s markets or the Union’s political stability and solidarity.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  The proposed regulation would have no financial impact on expenditure and only a very limited financial impact on revenue. Upon full application of the proposed regulation, the collection of increased customs duties corresponding to the proposed increases would be expected to be minimal (close to zero) because the proposed increase in duties is likely to reduce the import flows from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus to negligible volumes.  Conversely, some budget losses could be expected because the own resources generated for the Union’s budget would probably decrease. The exact value of the budget losses would depend on how the imports from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus would be replaced. On the one hand, replacing these imports by domestic production within the Union or by preferential imports (particularly of fertilisers from Algeria and Egypt) would result in a reduction of own resources. On the other hand, replacing them with increased imports from other third countries that are not preferential partners would not reduce own resources because these extra new imports would generate the same level of Common Customs Tariffs as the imports from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus that they would be replacing. Once the proposed regulation is fully in application, the effect on the Union budget’s traditional own resources is therefore estimated to be a loss of up to EUR 84 million (i.e. 75% of the total 2023 tariff revenue of EUR 112 million) in a scenario where all the existing Union imports from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus are replaced by the Union’s domestic production and preferential imports.  The loss of revenue in traditional own resources upon full application of the measure would be compensated by the Member States’ Gross National Income (GNI) based on resource contributions. However, it is expected that, during the first three years of application of the proposed measures, additional tariff revenues linked to higher tariffs on the remaining imports of nitrogen-based fertilisers from the Russian Federation or the Republic of Belarus would partially or possibly even fully offset the revenue losses associated with lower imported volumes. One could therefore expect that, during this initial three-year period, the net loss of revenue for these goods in traditional own resources would be close to zero.  The legislative financial statement sets out the budgetary implications of the proposed regulation in greater detail.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  On-line reporting on the development of Union imports of concerned agricultural goods and fertilisers originating in or exported directly or indirectly from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus is available on dedicated websites of the European Commission (Eurostat) 4 .  • Explanatory documents (for directives)  Not applicable.  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  The proposed regulation would prevent certain agricultural goods and fertilisers originating in or exported directly or indirectly from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus from accessing the Union market on terms that are as favourable as the terms that apply to imports of those goods from other origins. It would do so by raising import duties on all those goods – by an ad valorem duty of 50% for agricultural goods and by gradually increasing tariffs on fertilisers by a level starting at EUR 40 or EUR 45 per tonne (depending on the type of fertiliser) until the additional tariff reached the level of a prohibitive tariff of up to EUR 315 or 430 per tonne three years after the start of application of the restrictive measures. Within the three-year transitional period, these prohibitive level tariffs will also be introduced in the event goods from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus are imported above certain specified volumes. In addition, those goods that originate in or are exported directly or indirectly from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus would also be barred from benefiting from the Union’s tariff rate quotas for those goods. Those tariff rate quotas provide access to the Union market at a lower tariff level than the proposed new tariffs.  2025/0021 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  on the modification of customs duties applicable to imports of certain goods originating in or exported directly or indirectly from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 207 thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) The Union ’s imports of urea and nitrogen-based fertilisers from the Russia n Federation were significant at 3.6 million tonnes in 2023 and increased considerably in 2024 by compar ison with 2023 . The level of the Union ’s imports from the Russian Federation of the agricultural goods co vered by this Regulation (‘the concerned agricultural goods’) is relatively low for most goods , but could increas e significantly if the current trading conditions persist .  (2) The import s of the fertilisers covered by this Regulation (‘the concerned fertilisers’) currently reflect a situation of economic dependency on the Russian Federation . Moreover, the impor t s of the concerned agricultural goods could create a similar and additional economic dependency on the Russian Federation, which should in the present circumstances be prevented and reduced in order to protect the Union ’s markets and safeguard the Union ’s food security .  (3) The Union’s erga omnes common customs duties are the currently applied most-favoured-nation tariffs on imports of the concerned agricultural goods and fertilisers . T hey vary greatly at present . Depending on the good, some tariffs are either set at zero or are very low, while other tariffs are so high that no trade takes place.  (4) The continued importation of the agricultural goods and fertilisers covered by this Regulation from the Russian Federation under current conditions could mak e the Union vulnerable to coercive actions by the Russian Federation. In particular, a potential increase in the import ation of th e concerned goods from the Russian Federation could disrupt the Union’s market and negatively impact the Union’s producers. It is therefore necessary to take appropriate tariff measures in order to address the Union’s current and potential economic dependency on imports of those goods from the Russia n Federation . This should be done by ending the current situation where they enter the Union market on terms that are as favourable as those applied to goods from other origins that receive most-favoured-nation treatment .  (5) At present, imports of the concerned fertilisers from the Russian Federation are already increasing and could increase further and quickly if additional Russian production is re-oriented towards the Union . Such potential increased imports from the Russian Federation would disrupt the Union’s market for those goods and harm the Union’s nitrogen fertilisers producers , wh o are already facing difficulties in compet ing with imports from the Russia n Federation because gas prices in the Union remain high. The long-term survival of the Union ’ s nitrogen fertiliser industry is of crucial importance for the Union ’ s food security because the Union’s agricultural sector needs these fertilisers in order to produce food. A ddressing the growing dependency on imports of the concerned fertilisers from the Russian Federation and preserving the viability of an autonomous Union nitrogen fertiliser industry is therefore vital to ensuring and maintaining the Union ’ s food security. In order to prevent a future dependency on agricultural goods imports from the Russian Federation, it is also necessary to adjust the tariff levels for these products .  (6) The tariff measures should also be taken in respect of the Republic of Belarus in order to prevent potential imports to the Union from the Russian Federation from being diverted through the Republic of Belarus, given its close political and economic ties with the Russia n Federation . This could happen if the Union ’s tariffs on imports of goods from the Republic of Belarus were to remain unchanged.  (7) I mports of the concerned agricultural goods and fertilisers that originat e in or are exported directly or indirectly from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus should therefore be subject to higher customs duties than imports from other third countries.  (8) I mports from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus should not benefit from any lower tariffs under the Union’s tariff rate quotas , on terms of most-favoured-nation treatment. T he reduced rates set out in the Union’s tariff rate quotas for the goods listed in the Annex es I and II to this Regulation should therefore not apply to goods originating in or exported directly or indirectly from the Russian Federation or the Republic of Belarus to the Union.  (9) The envisaged increase in customs duties is not expected to negatively affect global food security because the increase in tariffs applies only to imports into the Union and does not affect goods concerned Regulation if they are only transiting through the Union ’s territory to third countries of final destination . T o the contrary, the envisaged increase in Union import duties may increase the exportation of those goods to third countries and increase the availability of supplies there .  (10) At the same time, fertilisers play a significant role for the food security as well as for the financial stability of the farmers in the Union. It is therefore necessary to ensure predictable and sufficient access to fertilisers, at affordable price levels for Union farmers, which should in turn contribute to the stabilisation of agricultural markets. During a transitional period, the proposed measure would stimulate stepping up the Union production and allow for reinforcing alternative sources of supply from other international partners, minimising the risk that fertilisers prices for Union farmers increase substantially. To this end, the Commission should monitor closely the evolution of fertiliser prices on the Union market. Should fertiliser prices substantially increase, the Commission should assess the situation and take all appropriate actions to remedy such surge .  (11) The envisaged increase in customs duties is consistent with the Union’s external action in other areas, as set out in Article 21 (3) of the Treaty on European Union. The state of relations between the Union and the Russian Federation has greatly deteriorated in recent years and particular ly since 2022 . This is due to the Russian Federation’s blatant disregard for international law and, in particular, its unprovoked and unjustified military aggression and full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Since July 2014, the Union has progressively imposed restrictive measures on trade with the Russian Federation in response to the Russian Federation ’s actions vis-à-vis Ukraine .  (12) T he Russian Federation is a Member of the World Trade Organization . However, the Union is currently allowed , by virtue of the exceptions that apply under the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization, and in particular Article XXI of the GATT 1994 (security exceptions ), to disregard the obligation to accord to goods imported from the Russian Federation the advantages granted to like similar products imported from other countries ( most-favoured-nation treatment) and is not prevented from ch arg ing import duties higher than those contained in the Union’s schedule of tariff commitments on trade in goods, if the Union considers such measures to be necessary in order to protect the Union’s essential security interests.  (13) The situation between the Union and the Republic of Belarus has also deteriorated in recent years due to the regime’s disregard for international law, fundamental freedoms and human rights , as well as its support for the Russian Federation’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Since October 2020, the Union has progressively imposed restrictive measures on trade with the Republic of Belarus.  (14) T he Republic of Belarus is not a Member of the World Trade Organization . T he Union is therefore not obliged, by virtue of the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization, to accord to goods from the Republic of Belarus most-favoured-nation treatment and other treatment in line with that A greement . In addition, existing trade agreements allow actions justified on the basis of applicable exception clauses, in particular security exceptions.  (15) This Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives pursued in accordance with Article 5(4) of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality , it is necessary and appropriate to lay down rules increasing tariffs on those goods with immediate effect , firstly in order to achieve the basic objective of ensuring that the concerned agricultural goods and fertilisers that originat e in or are exported directly or indirectly from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus do not disturb the Union’s market for those goods ; and secondly in order to implement the C ommon C ommercial P olicy and reduce the Union’s import s of these goods and fertilisers from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus in response to concerns that such imports c ould negatively affect the Union’s internal market and impair the Union’s food security ,  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Article 1  1. Goods classified in the Combined Nomenclature (CN) codes listed in Annex I that are imported into the Union and that originat e in or are exported directly or indirectly from the Russian Federation or the Republic of Belarus, shall be subject to an additional 50% ad valorem tariff customs duty that shall apply on top of the applicable Common Customs Tariff rate. Such goods originating in or exported directly or indirectly from the Russian Federation or the Republic of Belarus shall not be eligible for lower import duties for limited quantities (tariff rate quotas), as they apply , because they are either required by Union obligations under the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization, or opened by the Union without such obligation.  2.

Article 3  This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union . It shall apply from four weeks after its entry into force in respect of the goods listed in Annex I.  This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.  Done at Brussels,  For the European Parliament For the Council  The President The President  LEGISLATIVE FINANCIAL STATEMENT  NAME OF THE PROPOSAL:  Proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the modification of customs duties applicable to imports of certain goods originating in or exported directly or indirectly from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus  BUDGET LINES:  Chapter and article: Chapter 12, Article 120.  Amount budgeted for 2024: EUR 24 620 400 000.  FINANCIAL IMPACT:  ◻ Proposal has no financial implications  X Proposal has no financial impact on expenditure but has a financial impact on the traditional own resources revenue for the following reasons .  In 2023, the total value of the Union’s imports from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus of CN codes within the scope of this proposed regulation and subject to the proposed increase was over EUR 1.69 billion. Of this total, imports of agricultural goods were EUR 380 million and imports of fertilisers were EUR 1.31 billion.  Imports of concerned fertilisers from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus are currently subject to a 6.5% ad valorem tariff. Most of the 2023 fertiliser imports (EUR 516 million) took place under CN code 3102 10 10. Significant imports also took place under CN codes 3105 30 00 (EUR 179 million), 3105 20 10 (EUR 151 million), 3105 40 00 (EUR 91 million) and 3 105 59 00 (EUR 89 million). The overall tariff revenue for the Union from fertiliser imports from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus was EUR 85.2 million, before deduction of collection costs by Member States.  Imports of the concerned agricultural products are subject to varying duties. In 2023 the overall tariff revenue for the Union from imports of those goods from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus was EUR 27 million, before deduction of collection costs by Member States. For these agricultural goods, the increase of tariffs by this proposed regulation is expected to considerably decrease or even stop these trade flows. The collection of increased customs duties corresponding to the proposed increases on agricultural goods is expected to be minimal (close to zero), because trade flows are expected to cease due to the increase in tariff levels.  The collection of increased customs duties corresponding to the proposed increases on fertilisers is expected to cease when the proposed regulation enters into full application upon the end of the three-year transition period, because trade flows are expected to cease due to the increase in tariff levels. These trade flows and associated customs duties are nevertheless expected to remain substantial during the transition period.  On the basis of the abovementioned factors, the impact on the loss of revenue for the Union budget resulting from this proposed regulation is estimated at a maximum of EUR 84 million per year as from the financial year 2029: [(EUR 85.2 million + EUR 27 million) = EUR 112.2 million gross amount, including collection costs] x 0.75.  For 2025, 2026, 2027 and 2028, the impact of the loss of traditional own resources revenue for the Union budget is estimated to be much lower than the amount calculated for 2028. This is because increased duties on fertilisers are expected to bring additional tariff revenues of EUR 77 million per 12-month period (after deduction of collection costs), contributing to an increase of own resources of EUR 58 million. The net reduction of own resources is therefore expected to be no higher than EUR 26 million in the first 12-month period of the application (1 July 2025 – 30 June 2026), corresponding to EUR 14 million for the remaining of the year 2025. It is even possible that own resources may increase if the reduction of imports from the Russian Federation is partially matched by imports from other third countries that do not benefit from tariff preferences under the Union’s free trade agreements.  The loss of revenue in traditional own resources will be compensated by Member States’ Gross National Income (GNI) based on resource contributions.

final  2025/0084(COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulations (EU) 2021/1058 and (EU) 2021/1056 as regards specific measures to address strategic challenges in the context of the mid-term review  EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM  1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  The mid-term review of cohesion policy presents an opportunity for Member States to redirect 2021-2027 resources towards investment in defence capabilities and for the competitiveness and strategic autonomy of the EU and in other emerging priorities, including clean industrial deal objectives by submitting corresponding programme amendments to the Commission. However, the framework for cohesion policy investments set out in the ERDF, Cohesion Fund and JTF regulations is not sufficiently aligned with these new priorities. Furthermore, additional flexibility is required to accelerate investment in these areas, notably to reinforce the resilience of the EU economy and all its regions at a critical geopolitical juncture such as the one the EU is currently facing. This proposal sets out a number of adjustments to these regulations to achieve these objectives.  Aligning cohesion policy investments to new priorities  In recent years, geopolitical dynamics have been marked by profound uncertainty, necessitating a fundamental re-evaluation of the EU’s strategic autonomy, resilience and preparedness. These shifts are unfolding alongside the green, social and technological transitions, which are rapidly reshaping the world around us. The challenges posed by these simultaneous transformations were comprehensively analysed in the report on the “Future of European Competitiveness”, published in September 2024. The report underscores the urgent need to close the innovation gap, accelerate decarbonisation efforts to strengthen economic competitiveness, and reduce external dependencies by diversifying supply chains and scaling-up domestically produced green energy investing in climate resilience, digitalisation and critical sectors.  In response, several major initiatives have already been launched to enhance the EU’s economic resilience and strategic autonomy. These include the “Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform” (STEP), which aims to strengthen Europe’s technological leadership; “REPowerEU”, designed to reduce reliance on external energy sources and accelerate the green transition, to complete interventions already underway via cohesion policy programmes and the “Recovery and Resilience Facility” (RRF), to support structural changes in Member States and regions as well as to enhance their resilience.  As the EU’s main investment instrument within the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), cohesion policy plays a crucial role in supporting these priorities. It drives targeted investments that contribute to economic, social and territorial cohesion while at the same time addressing emerging challenges. However, the regulatory framework governing the 2021-2027 cohesion policy funds was drafted, negotiated and adopted before the series of major geopolitical and economic events that have since reshaped some of the EU’s strategic political priorities.  Similarly, the Partnership Agreements and the national and regional cohesion policy programmes were developed and approved within this same timeframe, hence reflecting the priorities set at the time. Given the evolving global and regional context, the 2025 mid-term review presents a critical opportunity to assess their implementation and the effectiveness of their contribution to the evolving priorities. This review will help determine the extent to which cohesion policy programmes can directly and swiftly respond to rapidly changing political, economic and social realities.  At the same time, it has become evident that the early implementation of the 2021-2027 cohesion policy programmes has faced challenges which have not been conducive to a swift uptake and rapid disbursement of the funds, leading to delays in their implementation compared to previous programming periods. These delays come at a time when strong and accelerated investment is essential to support economic resilience and competitiveness.  · Against this backdrop, the Commission is proposing targeted amendments to Regulations (EU) 2021/1056 and (EU) 2021/1058. These changes aim to adjust investment priorities with the evolving economic, societal, and geopolitical context , as well as with our climate and environment objectives, while at the same time introducing greater flexibility and incentives to facilitate and encourage the rapid deployment of much-needed resources. By refining the 2021-2027 cohesion policy framework, the EU can ensure that its investment mechanisms remain agile and responsive, enabling a more effective response to current and future challenges.  · In order for Member States to make effectively use of the possibilities provided in this proposal, the Commission proposes that they be allowed to re-submit their mid-term review proposal by 2 months after the entry into force of the present proposal for amendment to Regulation (EU) 2021/1058 . Any programme amendment that would be carried out pursuant to the new priorities and flexibilities, shall be without prejudice to the application of any measures adopted under Regulation (EU) 2020/2092 and to the compliance by relevant programmes with the priorities under Article 15 of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060. In this context the Commission will closely monitor the conformity of the programmes with the requirements of relevant EU law.  Competitiveness and decarbonisation  The Commission presented in the Competitiveness Compass, the Clean Industrial Deal and the Affordable Energy Action Plan a concrete path for Europe to regain its competitiveness and secure sustainable prosperity, with decarbonisation and circularity as drivers of growth.  In particular, energy intensive industries play a critical role in our regions and require special attention as part of the reprogramming of EU funds.  These industries face significant challenges, including higher energy costs compared to their global competitors, the continued lack of competitiveness of certain clean technologies, a slow-down in demand in some of the main downstream sectors, increased international competition driven by overcapacities and subsidised production in non-EU countries As a result, these factors undermine the competitiveness of energy intensive industries and weaken Europe’s decarbonisation and resilience objectives.  The cohesion funds can already support investments to climate objectives as laid down in Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 but efforts should be further accelerated in order to ensure that decarbonisation is a driver for growth for European industries and the prosperity of Europeans. In light of the significant investment needs to achieve our decarbonisation and competitiveness objectives, Member States need to continue investing in projects directly contributing to the climate and energy transition in line with the requirements set out in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 which will continue to apply to maintain the level of climate related investments.  Support for projects within the scope of STEP should be made possible in all regions, including in the more developed regions in Member States of the Union with GDP per head above the EU average to the extent it is allowed by State aid rules as set out in Articles 107 and 108 of the Treaty , in particular to the extent such investments contribute to the Union’s strategic objectives as set out in the applicable guidelines such as the future Clean Industrial State aid Framework (currently in public consultation) and in the IPCEI Communication 1 .  Furthermore, other restrictions linked to STEP as regards the ceiling set at 20% of the ERDF allocation for reprogramming should be removed and the deadline for submitting STEP amendments and benefit from the additional one-off prefinancing deleted. This should also help in promoting investments in innovative clean technologies (manufacturing capacities and deployment) that are essential to deliver on the objectives of the Clean Industrial Deal and also in other important support areas for which STEP provides important incentives.  It is important to recognise and strengthen the role also of large enterprises in regional development, as they steer research, innovation, knowledge, and technology transfer towards other companies and create demand and employment throughout the supply chain. With the objective to maximise the impact of EU support to boost growth and competitiveness, the Commission also proposes to expand the possibilities to provide support for productive investments in enterprises other than SMEs under the ERDF in cases where the financial resources are used for (1) supporting investments contributing to the STEP objectives, (2) enhancing the industrial capacities to foster defence capabilities, (3) contributing to  a defence projects and (4) facilitating industrial adjustment linked to the decarbonisation and support to circular processes of production processes and products, such as in the automotive and energy intensive industries, to the extent allowed by State aid rules . Investments in projects directly participating in an IPCEI as approved by the Commission pursuant to Article 107(3), point (b) TFEU, and to Communication C(2021) 8481, in enterprises other than SMEs may also be supported. Support for such enterprises needs to be further facilitated under the Just Transition Fund as well by not requiring a gap analysis. Therefore, it is proposed that Member States are allowed, in line with State aid rules, to directly grant support from ERDF to projects directly participating in an Important Project of Common European Interest approved by the Commission pursuant to Article 107(3), point (b), of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and to Communication C(2021) 8481 .  To further enhance the leverage of InvestEU, the EU flagship programme to boost investments in strategic and critical industries, and further the transfer possibilities already provided by the legislation, the Commission proposes to make possible the transfer of resources from the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund to InvestEU Member State compartments for implementing a new InvestEU financial instrument for the achievement of cohesion policy objectives.  Defence and security  In the face of unprecedented geopolitical instability in decades, the European Union must now make crucial decisions to ensure its readiness and security. To guarantee its own defence deterrence, Europe must be prepared to enter a new era by significantly increasing its support for the development of the defence capabilities, reduced dependencies, infrastructure resilience and the competitiveness of the EU defence industry. This effort will enable the Union to address the short-term urgency of supporting Ukraine while ensuring the continent’s long-term stability.  The Commission has proposed to the European Council an immediate response plan — REARM Europe — amounting to EUR 800 billion, by activating all available financial levers to swiftly and significantly support investment in European defence capacities. Among these levers, the Union budget can further contribute to this collective effort through a new dedicated defence instrument and the strengthening of the European Defence Industry Programme (EDIP).  To complement these tools and further incentivise Member States to directly support defence investments, it is essential that cohesion policy funding can be swiftly mobilised. These investments will reinforce the resilience and EU competitiveness while promoting regional development and growth. They will also tackle the dual challenge faced by the Union’s regions bordering Russia, Belarus and Ukraine: strengthening security while revitalising their economies.  In order to provide for a framework that allows for flexibility and financial support, the Commission proposes to create two new specific objectives within the existing scope of the ERDF support. The first new specific objective allows Member States to reprogramme under their 2021-2027 programmes under the Investments for jobs and growth goal amounts for enhancing productive capacities in enterprises in the defence sector without restriction in terms of geography or size of the enterprise. Productive investments in enterprises other than SMEs and made in all EU regions should also be able to access financial support for defence industry projects of common interest under EDIP and reinforce Europe’s overall defence and preparedness capacities. The second new specific objective related to defence contributes to building resilient defence or dual use infrastructure to foster military mobility in the EU. These specific objectives also help eastern border regions.  It is proposed that Member States, when using the proposed framework, benefit from an additional one-off pre-financing of 30% of the amounts programmed under the dedicated priority and the possibility to apply a Union financing of up to 100% regarding both specific objectives – provided that the programme amendment is submitted in 2025.  Affordable housing (including social housing)  Housing prices and rents have increased significantly over the past years. At the same time, wages have not increased at a similar pace. This uneven evolution has created a widening gap between the availability of affordable housing and the needs of the population.  The average house prices declined after 2008 following the economic recession but have consistently risen throughout the EU since 2013. In total, there was an increase of 59% in the EU between 2013 and the third quarter of 2024, which is about twice the increase in the overall price level (HICP) in the same period.  The escalation of house price growth has not been matched by a corresponding rise in wages, leading to considerable pressure on housing affordability. The price-to-income ratio increased by more than 15pp between 2013 and 2022, and despite some respite in 2023 it is still above its long-term average.  While the issue varies in severity from country to country and region to region, its impact is widespread. High housing costs force many households to allocate a disproportionate share of their income to rent or mortgages, leaving less for other necessities like food, healthcare and education – with a risk of falling into poverty. In 2023, one out of three households that are at risk of poverty spend 40% or more of the household disposable income on housing. House prices differ also between urban and non-urban areas. Housing prices as a proportion of income are higher and have been steadily increasing since 2015 in metropolitan and other urban areas, while they remained stable in other areas. The social impact of these figures is wider if we consider that they include the lack of students housing and of adequate lodgements for prospective new families .  The lack of sufficient affordable housing puts an increasing number of households under severe difficulties, but it also has a competitiveness angle. Indeed, European companies in some areas start to have problems to attract workers because the costs of housing and living in those areas are disproportionately high as compared to income. High prices are also putting public services in certain cities under pressure due to difficulties in attracting essential public workers (teachers, nurses, police, etc.).  Against this background, the political guidelines of the Commission give housing policy strong emphasis by proposing a coordinated approach under the upcoming European ‘Affordable Housing Plan’. As part of this overarching ambition, the Commission now proposes to address the growing investment gap in affordable housing by allowing Member States to reprogramme under their 2021-2027 programmes amounts for supporting investments that promote access to affordable housing. Investments under the New European Bauhaus should make full use of these new possibilities provided.  At the same time, it must be ensured that housing is climate resilient.  The Commission proposes to include corresponding additional specific objectives under three policy objectives thus allowing flexibility for Member States and regions depending on their programming structures and the focus of the housing interventions.  In order to incentivise reprioritising their programmes and uptake, and without prejudice to compliance with State aid rules, it is proposed that Member States, when using the proposed framework, benefit from a 100% Union financing and a pre-financing of 30% of the amounts programmed under the dedicated priority. With a view to enhancing the impact of investments, the scope of interventions now allows to include actions linked to implementing reforms under cohesion policy, provided that the programme amendment is submitted in 2025.  Access to water, sustainable water management and water resilience  Water is a vital resource for the security of our food, energy and economic systems, yet both at EU and global level water resources are facing mounting pressures. Effective water management is essential for safeguarding public health, protecting the environment, and maintaining the EU’s economic competitiveness. Mismanagement, including over-abstraction and pollution, is increasingly constraining critical sectors such as agriculture, energy, manufacturing, and transport. The EU is faced with increasing impacts from climate change which exacerbate the existing pressures on water quality, water quantity and marine ecosystems.  In this context, it is urgent to enhance implementation of the water and marine protection legislation and improve water efficiency, address water scarcity, and progress towards a water resilient Europe, requiring significant efforts and investments. The EU water sector and blue economy sector are significant economic sectors in many regions, driving innovation, and safeguarding public health, and sustainability, e.g. by offering advanced solutions such as desalination, water treatment, water reuse, blue biotechnology etc. The global leadership in water technologies enhances the EU’s export potential and creates jobs in all regions across Europe.  The EU therefore must protect these water ecosystems and infrastructures by scaling up investments and consider water supply and infrastructure through the lens of ensuring access to and supply of water to our citizens and societies in all circumstances.  The EU has established a strong legal framework for the sustainable and secure management of water, but further progress in implementation is essential and more decisive action is urgently needed. For that reason, the EU will come forward with an EU Water Resilience Strategy in the first half of 2025. In line with the Preparedness Union Strategy, water resilience requires a shift from reactive crisis management to proactive, risk-based management and increased preparedness.  In the 2021-2027 period, almost EUR 13 billion are being invested in water services and improved wastewater collection and treatment in cohesion policy programmes. But additional efforts from the public and private sectors are needed to ensure sufficient progress Therefore, to properly emphasise the importance and focus of investments in water resilience, the Commission proposes to modify the wording of the specific objective related to water management under policy objective 2 “A greener, low-carbon transitioning towards a net zero carbon economy and resilient Europe by promoting clean and fair energy transition, green and blue investment, the circular economy, climate change mitigation and adaptation, risk prevention and management, and sustainable urban mobility”.  Cohesion policy investments in sustainable and secure investments should be incentivised, notably to contribute to build a water resilient society, through increased restoration of water bodies, deployment of nature-based solutions to reduce floods risk and increase the capacity of ecosystems to store water, improved control of water abstractions and increased water efficiency and reuse increased digitisation of water infrastructure, mitigation of drought and desertification impacts, flooding and extreme weather events, and compliance with the Water Framework, the Groundwater, the Urban Wastewater Treatment, and the Environmental Quality Standards Directives. It is proposed that Member States, when using the proposed framework, benefit from the possibility of a Union financing up to 100% and a pre-financing of 30% of the amounts programmed under the dedicated priority for this new specific objective.  Energy transition  Another area where cohesion policy investments contribute to EU priorities is climate action and climate transition, where the policy invests more than EUR 110 billion. In light of the significant investment needs of the climate transition, Member States need to maintain their efforts to respect the funds’ climate ambition.  In order to enhance energy security and accelerate the transition across the Union and also to promote clean mobility, a new specific objective should be created to promote energy interconnectors and related transmission infrastructure, and the deployment of recharging infrastructure from ERDF and Cohesion Fund resources.  In order to accelerate the energy transition of industry, notably in energy-intensive sectors, that is necessary for reaching the EU climate objectives and for the EU’s competitiveness and resilience, the Commission proposes to enlarge the scope of support from the ERDF to decarbonisation of projects selected in the context of Union instruments in particular projects in installations that have been awarded a ‘Sovereignty Seal’ under the Innovation Fund established by the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), and to reduce administrative checks for similar support under the JTF.  To increase climate resilience is essential to ensure competitiveness. In line with the Preparedness Union Strategy and the concept of preparedness and security by design, it is vital to ensure sustainable and informed investments, based on proper climate modelling data, so as to protect both vulnerable populations and the EU economy and competitiveness.  Eastern border regions  Given the challenges of the eastern border regions since the Russian aggression against Ukraine, programmes under the Investment for jobs and growth goal with NUTS 2 regions that have borders with Russia, Belarus or Ukraine, should benefit from the possibility of a one-off 9.5% pre-financing of the programme allocation and a 100% Union financing.  Greater flexibility and simplification for accelerating investments  Halfway through the 2021-2027 programming period, the level of payments claimed by the Member States to the Commission is low, owing to a combination of factors: the late adoption of the regulations governing the policy; the need to face successive crises from the COVID-19 pandemic to the war against Ukraine, and to the energy crisis; the pressure to close the previous programming period; and the priority given to implement the instruments of NGEU, given their shorter implementation timeframe. All this has in turn put a strain on the administrative capacities of Member States’ authorities to design and quickly deliver investments. Notwithstanding a rapid acceleration experienced over last year with project selection close to 40% of the allocations, cohesion policy implementation should rapidly pick up pace in a context where the Union is facing a range of new challenges requiring rapid responses. The Commission therefore proposes a set of measures aiming at further enhancing the flexibility and simplification of the use of cohesion policy support for accelerating investments:  – To avoid that programme implementation is delayed because of national budgetary constraints, and to expand the financial capacity of Member States to address the newly emerging challenges, the Commission proposes to provide a one-off 4.5% pre-financing provided from the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund in 2026 to all programmes that reallocate at least 15% of their resources for the new priorities in the context of the mid-term review process . The pre-financing percentage is proposed to be increased to 9.5% in 2026 for programmes under the Investment for jobs and growth goal covering one or more NUTS2 regions bordering Russia, Belarus or Ukraine. To avoid that the risk of delays and corresponding loss of funds reduces willingness to undertake programme amendments and to ensure the proper implementation of the operations concerned, the Commission proposes to extend the time limit for using the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund resources and extend the end date for eligibility by an additional year. This flexibility is proposed to be made available only for programmes that proposed amendments resulting in reallocation of at least 15% of the resources for the new priorities set out in the present proposal and in the context of the mid-term review exercise, once approved.  – Costs related to preparatory actions for reforms will be eligible including for self-standing reforms (i.e. not accompanied by investments).  – To further enhance synergies among EU policies and instruments, it is proposed that the JTF is also covered by the Seal of Excellence ( including the Sovereignty Seal) mechanism and the possibility for a simplified selection procedure under Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 thus providing support to projects selected under other EU instruments, which do not have sufficient funding. In light of the high demand for the Innovation Fund and its track record in supporting projects that are sufficiently mature and have a significant potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and that either demonstrate highly innovative technologies, processes or products, or are aimed at scaling up innovative technologies, processes or products to achieve their broad commercial roll-out across the EU, t he Commission also proposes to align with the possibilities for projects support ed under the Innovation Fund and include a corresponding targeted provision allowing for the production, processing, transport, distribution, storage or combustion of fossil fuels provided these projects were attributed a Sovereignty Seal under the Innovation Fund.  – Recognising the important role of cities in delivering EU objectives, in addressing local challenges and in strengthening the urban-rural links to drive a balanced regional development, the Commission proposes to reinforce the European Urban Initiative (EUI) by introducing the possibility of reallocating resources from the ERDF to the EUI. Such amounts would support actions for the benefit of Member States initiating the reallocation. The Commission also proposes to establish a Seal of Excellence for the EUI, thus enabling support under cohesion policy programmes for EUI projects that have been selected but could not receive funding due to insufficient resources. Member States would also have the possibility to reallocate ERDF resources from their programmes under the Investment for j obs and g rowth goal to the Interregional Innovation Investment Instrument thus having more flexibility in the use of resources. These reallocations are taking place within the same fund, the ERDF, and therefore it is proposed not to count them towards the ceilings set out in Article 26 of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060.  With the objective of easing the successful and effective implementation of the JTF, the Commission proposes to remove the current restrictions applicable to the modification of indicator targets in the Just Transition Plans after their amendment following the mid-term review. These restrictions can be removed only if they do not affect the transition to climate neutrality and fossil fuel phase out commitments.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  The proposal is consistent with the objectives followed by the cohesion policy funds and is limited to a targeted amendment of Regulation (EU) 2021/1058 and Regulation (EU) 2021/1056.  • Consistency with other Union policies  The proposal is limited to a targeted amendment of Regulation (EU) 2021/1058 and Regulation (EU) 2021/1056 and maintains consistency with other Union policies.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  The proposal is based on Articles, 175, 177,178 and 322 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  To encourage Member States to better align their cohesion policy programmes with emerging EU priorities while ensuring greater flexibility and simplification to accelerate investments, amendments to Regulation (EU) 2021/1058 and Regulation (EU) 2021/1056 are proposed. The same result cannot be achieved through actions at national level.  • Proportionality  The proposal aims at incentivising Member States to further align their cohesion policy programmes towards the emerging EU priorities and providing greater flexibility and simplification for accelerating investments. The measures do not go beyond what is necessary to achieve these goals.  • Choice of the instrument  A Regulation is the appropriate instrument as it provides directly applicable rules for the support.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  N/A  • Stakeholder consultations  N/A  • Collection and use of expertise  N/A  • Impact assessment  An impact assessment has been carried out to prepare the proposal for Regulation (EU) 2021/1058 and Regulation (EU) 2021/1056. The limited and targeted changes do not require a separate impact assessment.  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  N/A  • Fundamental rights  N/A  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  The proposal concerns cohesion policy programmes under the 2021-2027 period and will result in additional pre-financing to be paid under the ERDF in 2026. This additional pre-financing will lead to frontloading of payment appropriations to 2026 compared to a no policy-change scenario and is budgetary neutral over the 2021-2027 period. Based on the estimated uptake of the proposal, the total additional pre-financing to be paid in 2026 amounts to EUR 16.1 billion. At the same time, taking into account payment forecasts and implementation shifts, the net budgetary impact is estimated at EUR 3.6 billion, which will be included in the draft budget 2026. The possibility to apply for an increased Union financing rate for investments in defence, housing, water resilience, certain energy infrastructure and for programmes covering eastern border regions will also lead to a partial front-loading of payments, followed by lower payments at a later stage as the overall envelope is unchanged. The actual budgetary impact of the increased co-financing rate on an annual basis will depend on the Member States’ uptake and the pace of submission of payment applications.  The proposed modification does not require changes in the Multiannual Financial Framework annual ceilings for commitments and payments as per Annex I to Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2020/2093.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  The implementation of the measure will be monitored and reported upon in the framework of the general reporting mechanisms established in Regulation (EU) 2021/1060.  • Explanatory documents (for directives)  N/A  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  The proposal involves the amendment of Regulations (EU) 2021/1058 and (EU) 2021/1056 as regards the ERDF, the Cohesion Fund and the JTF:  Specific objectives  Competitiveness and decarbonisation  · The 20% limitation set on reprogramming resources to the STEP specific objectives is removed.  · Support from the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund to enterprises other than SMEs is made possible, to the extent they comply with State aid rules as set out in Articles 107 and 108 of the Treaty , for investments that participate in an Important Project of Common European Interest approved by the Commission pursuant to Article 107(3), point (b), of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), and to Communication C ( 2021 ) 8481, or where the enterprises facilitate industrial adjustment linked to the decarbonisation of production processes and products . In addition, the possibility to support large enterprises is extended to all regions in the context of the STEP specific objectives under policy objectives 1 and 2 , to the extent this is allowed under State aid rules ;  · The possibility for Member States to transfer resources from the ERDF or the Cohesion Fund to the Member State compartment of the InvestEU Fund for the deployment in the new Invest EU financial instrument, as included in the proposal for amendment of the InvestEU Regulation (COM(2025) 84);  · For Important Projects of Common European Interest that have been approved by the Commission pursuant to Article 107(3), point (b), of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and to Communication C ( 2021 ) 8481 , the selection process is simplified as the managing authorities are able, in line with State aid rules, to directly grant support from the ERDF for projects directly participating in such an approved Important Project of Common European Interest .  · Ensuring that investments with cohesion funding increase climate resilience , as it is also an essential part of ensuring competitiveness.  Defence and security  · A new specific objective is introduced under policy objective 1 for the ERDF and under policy objective 3 for the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund in support of investments in the EU’s defence capability and the scope of support is amended to allow for support to enterprises other than SMEs for these specific objectives , to the extent allowed under State aid rules . The specific objective under policy objective 3 will promote resilient defence or dual use infrastructure to foster military mobility in the Union. Furthermore, the Commission will pay, in addition to the yearly pre-financing for the programmes, 30% exceptional one-off pre-financing based on the resources allocated to these specific objectives in dedicated priorities and the maximum co-financing rate for these priorities is set at 100%.  Affordable housing (including social housing)  · To promote investments in affordable housing, including social housing and support to related reforms, three new specific objectives are introduced for the ERDF and one for the Cohesion Fund. For these specific objectives, the Commission will pay, in addition to the yearly pre-financing for the programmes, 30% exceptional one-off pre-financing based on the resources allocated to dedicated priorities and the maximum co-financing rate for dedicated priorities supporting these objectives is 100% . At the same time, it must be ensured that housing is climate resilient.  · Furthermore, the scope of the Just Transition Fund is amended to allow for investments in affordable housing and support for relevant reforms also to take place in support of the implementation of the territorial just transition plans.  Secure access to water, sustainable water management and water resilience  · The amendment of the specific objective into ‘promoting secure access to water , sustainable water management and water resilience ’ reflect s the strategic importance for the EU of resilient water management. To help accelerate investments in this area, the Commission will pay, in addition to the yearly pre-financing for the programmes, 30% exceptional one-off pre-financing based on the resources allocated to dedicated priorities supporting the specific objective and the maximum co-financing rate for dedicated priorities supporting these objectives is 100% .  Energy transition  · In order to enhance energy security and accelerate the transition across the Union and also to promote clean mobility, a new specific objective should be created to promote energy interconnectors and related transmission infrastructure, and the deployment of recharging infrastructure from ERDF and Cohesion Fund resources.  Eastern border regions  · Given the challenges of the e astern border regions since Russia ’s war of aggression against Ukraine, programmes under the Investment for jobs and growth goal - financed by the ERDF or the Cohesion Fund with NUTS 2 regions that have borders with Russia, Belarus or Ukraine - should benefit from the possibility of a one-off 9.5% pre-financing and a 100% Union financing , if programmes reallocate at least 15% of their resources for the newly introduced specific objectives and STEP . Where the corresponding programme covers the entire territory of the Member State, these financial flexibilities should only apply if the programme covering the entire territory of the Member State is the only programme in the Member State that includes the concerned NUTS 2 regions.  Cities  · The European Urban Initiative is strengthened by allowing the attribution of a Seal of Excellence for innovative actions that were assessed and comply with the minimum quality requirements but could not be financed due to budgetary constraints and by allowing Member States to allocate part of their initial national allocation of the ERDF to the European Urban Initiative. This reallocation would not count towards the ceilings set out in Article 26 of Regulation (EU) 2021 / 1060.  Further flexibilities on implementation  Thematic concentration  · The ERDF thematic concentration requirements are revised to accommodate the introduction of the new and amended specific objectives and the specific objectives that were introduced as part of the STEP Regulation. However, the requirements set out in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 in relation to climate-related investments will continue to apply.  Mid-term review  · In order that Member State s could effectively make use of the new priorities and flexibilities, it is proposed they be allowed to re-submit their mid-term review proposal by 2 months after the entry into force of these regulatory amendments .  · To help accelerate the implementation of the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund, all programmes that reallocate at least 15% of their resources for the newly introduced specific objectives and STEP would receive a one-off pre-financing of 4.5% on the basis of their amended programme budget (with the exception of NUTS 2 regions that have borders with Russia, Belarus or Ukraine , that benefit of the higher one-off prefinancing of 9.5% ) . The additional pre-financing related to the above set new priority areas would come in addition.  · In addition, the end-date for eligibility of expenditure is extended by one additional year for ERDF and Cohesion Fund programmes for which at least 15% of the envelope is refocused towards the new priority areas .  · In order to provide flexibility regarding the calculation of climate contribution, where the climate contribution as referred to in Article 6(1)  of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 is exceeded for either the Cohesion Fund or the ERDF, the amount exceeding the target could be taken into account when calculating the climate contribution for the other fund.  Further amendments aimed at streamlining the implementation include:  · The possibility for Member States to reallocate resources from the ERDF to the Interregional Innovation Investments Instrument;  · The possibility to support activities that contribute to the implementation of reforms;  · The duly justified revision of output indicator targets as part of a JTF programme amendment while ensuring that such revisions do not affect the transition to climate neutrality and fossil fuel phase out commitments .  2025/0084 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulations (EU) 2021/1058 and (EU) 2021/1056 as regards specific measures to address strategic challenges in the context of the mid-term review  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 175, 177, 178 and 322 thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 2 ,  Having regard to t he opinion of the Committee of the Regions 3 ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) In recent years, geopolitical dynamics have been marked by profound uncertainty, necessitating a fundamental re-evaluation of the Union ’s strategic autonomy , resilience and security alongside the challenges stemming from the green, social and technological transitions. Th o se simultaneous transformations demonstrate the urgent need to close the innovation gap, accelerate decarbonisation efforts to reinforce economic competitiveness and reduce external dependencies by diversifying supply chains , scaling-up domestically produced green energy, and investing in critical sectors .  (2) As the Union ’s main investment instrument within the Multiannual Financial Framework, cohesion policy plays a crucial role in supporting th o se priorities. It drives targeted investments that contribute to economic, social and territorial cohesion while at the same time addressing emerging challenges.  (3) The legal framework for cohesion policy programmes provides for a mid-term review in 2025, which offers a timely and unique opportunity to refocus programmes on addressing new challenges and opportunities, to accelerate implementation and to increase their effectiveness to respond to both old and new Union priorities.  (4) The Commission presented in the Competitiveness Compass, the Clean Industrial Deal and the Affordable Energy Action Plan a concrete path for Europe to regain its competitiveness and secure sustainable prosperity. The ERDF and the Cohesion Fund already support investments to climate objectives as stipulated in Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 . However , Member States should step up their efforts in order to ensure  that decarbonisation is a driver for growth for European industries and the prosperity of Europeans by, amongst others, scaling up support to clean-tech and the transition to clean energy, investing in energy infrastructure projects that can ensure a true Energy Union as well as supporting decarbonisation of production processes and products.  (5) In light of the unprecedented geopolitical instability and the need for the Union to guarantee its own defence, cohesion policy funding should be swiftly mobilised to directly support investments in defence capabilities . It is therefore necessary to create new specific objectives for support from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the Cohesion Fund established by Regulation (EU) 2021/1058 of the European Parliament and of the Council 4 to finance industrial capacities in the defence sector and to allow for investments in resilient d efence or d ual-use infrastructure with a view to fostering military mobility , in line with the scope of those funds . Industrial capacities to foster defence capabilities should relate to the technological development and production of defence products and other products for defence purposes, as defined in Article 2 of [draft] Council Regulation [xxxx] establishing the Security Action for Europe (SAFE) through the reinforcement of European defence industry Instrument, in particular those referred to in Article 1 of that Regulation. Member States are encouraged to use the possibility foreseen in the current legal framework of voluntarily transferring resources allocated to them in shared management to directly managed programmes with defence and security objectives. In this context, transfers to the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) military mobility envelope would ensure coordinated interventions along the military mobility corridors highlighted in the White Paper on Defence.  (6) Furthermore, in order to quickly inject liquidity to cover the most pressing needs notably for investments in enhanced defence capabilities , additional financing possibilities should be offered . In particular, it is necessary to provide for an additional one-off pre-financing of 30% of the amounts programmed under dedicated priorities for defence under the respective policy objectives of the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund and the possibility to apply a Union co-financing rate of up to 100%.  (7) The ERDF and the Cohesion Fund may , within their respective scopes, already support investments contributing to the objectives of the ‘ Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform ’ (STEP) , which aims to strengthen Europe’s technological leadership . In order to further incentivise investments from the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund in th o se critical fields , the limitation for the overall contribution of the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund to th o se priorities should be removed and the possibility for Member States to receive a higher pre-financing for related programme amendments should be extended . Furthermore, the possibilities for the financing of productive investments contributing to STEP objectives in enterprises other than SMEs should be extended to all regions . Similarly, such investments should also be possible in regions where they facilitate industrial adjustment linked to digital transformation, including digital capacities in cloud, AI and supercomputing, or the decarbonisation and circularity of production processes and products, such as in the automotive industry or the energy intensive industries . In addition, the possibility provided for investments contributing to STEP objectives to finance productive investments in enterprises other than SMEs from the Just Transition Fund (JTF) established by Regulation (EU) 2021/1056 of the European Parliament and of the Council 5 without the need and irrespective of the outcome of a gap analysis should be extended to all investments.  (8) In order to enhance energy security , accelerate the energy transition and clean mobility, the investments under STEP and the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Facility should be complemented by creating a new specific objective for the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund under policy objective 2 to promote energy interconnectors and related transmission infrastructure, and the deployment of charging infrastructure. I n order to accel erate investments in t hese fields , p riorities dedicated to this specific objective should benefit from an additional one-off pre-financing of 30% of the amounts programmed under those priorities and from the possibility to apply a Union co-financing rate of up to 100 %. Managing authorities should aim to leverage a maximum amount of private finance, where relevant. This enhanced investment effort will enable energy-intensive sectors to access more stable and diverse energy sources in a less fragmented internal energy market, buttressing their sustainability and competitiveness. Moreover, expanding the ERDF’s support for decarbonisation projects allows energy-intensive industries to prioritise high-impact innovations aligned with EU climate objectives.  (9) I mportant P rojects of C ommon E uropean I nterest (IPCEI) result from a State aid instrument requiring cross-European cooperation for innovative technologies or pan-European infrastructures. IPCEI are projects that support and promote large-scale, cross-border projects that are considered essential for the economic growth, innovation, and competitiveness of the Union . To help accelerate the design of new IPCEI and the implementation of the existing ones, support from the ERDF for investments in projects participating in an IPCEI as approved by the Commission pursuant to Article 107(3), point (b), of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and to Communication C ( 2021 ) 8481 should be allowed in all categories of region s . F urthermore, operations contributing to an IPCEI approved by the Commission should benefit from simplified selection procedures.  (10) Affordable housing is another challenge that has come to the forefront due to the significant increase in prices and rents in recent years. With a view to incentivis ing Member States and regions to double investments from the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund, within their respective scopes, in the construction and renovation of the affordable housing stock, includ ing social housing, new specific objectives should be created under different policy objectives to provide flexibility for the programming of housing interventions under dedicated priorit ies . Such priorities should entail the possibility to apply a Union co-financing rate of up to 100% and benefit from an additional one-off pre-financing of 30% of the amounts programmed in order to alleviate the burden on public budgets . For example, investments under the ‘New European Bauhaus’ initiative should make full use of those new possibilities. Costs resulting from the temporary renting of alternative accommodation for the occupants during the time of the renovation may also be entitled to support under such priorities , as well as costs of reforms related to housing , such as preparatory work for improvements in housing market regulation and permitting at local and city level. It is also appropriate to clarify the support of the JTF in th at context.  (11) Water has a vital role as a resource for the security of food, energy and economic systems. This is also a key aspect of ensuring climate resilience. Given the challenges posed by the impact of climate change on water resources, f urther investments in water resilience should be encouraged. It is urgent to enhance the implementation of the water and marine protection legislation and improve water efficiency, address water scarcity, and progress towards a water resilient Europe.  This requires important investments. It is therefore appropriate to include a reference to secure access to water, sustainable water management and water resilience in the new specific objective under policy objective 2 to allow for proactive, risk-based management and increased preparedness. Dedicated priorities established for th at specific objective should also benefit from an additional one-off pre-financing of 30% of the amounts programmed and the possibility of a co-financing rate of up to 100% in order to incentivise crucial investments in th at field.  (12) Finally, in order to enhance the effectiveness of investments, it is important to allow for the payment of costs related to the implementation of reforms, also where such costs are not directly linked to the implementation of investments.  (13) In order to enable Member States to carry out a meaningful reprogramming in the context of the mid-term review and focus resources on those new strategic Union priorities, additional restrictions should be lifted. As regards thematic concentration requirements, it is appropriate to allow Member States to count amounts programmed for new strategic priorities , including those contributing to STEP objectives , towards the amounts required to ensure compliance with thematic concentration requirements . This should be accompanied with some flexibility regarding the calculation of the respective climate contribution for the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund as set out in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2 0 21/1060 , while respecting the overall requirements of that Article . In addition, to accelerate the decarbonisation of industry that is necessary for reaching the Union’s climate objectives, it is necessary to provide for the possibility to finance , through the ERDF , investments aimed at achieving the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions also from activities listed in Annex I to Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 6 provided that they have been awarded a Seal Excellence . Similarly , as regards the JTF , the conditions for financing such investments should be simplified. Furthermore, in order to ensure consistency of support between financing granted under direct and shared management, operations that have already been assessed in the context of directly managed programmes and been attributed a ‘ Sovereignty Seal ’ as defined in Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) 2024/795 in a call for proposals under Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/856 by the Commission should not be subject to the fossil fuel exclusion . Member States should also be given the possibility to contribute resources from the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund to the Member State compartment of the InvestEU Fund 7 to deploy them through the InvestEU financial instrument set out in [ Article 10a of Regulation (EU) 2021/523 ] . Finally, in order to allow for a comprehensive reprogramming towards the new strategic priorities in the context of the mid-term review, Member States shou ld benefit from additional time to comple ment the assessment of the outcome of the mid - term review and the submission of related programme amendments . This should also apply to JTF resources where they are included in a programme together with ERDF or Cohesion Fund resources.  (14) In order to accelerate the implementation of cohesion policy programmes more generally and inject the necessary liquidity for key investments to be implemented, an additional one-off pre-financing for the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund should be paid for programmes under both the Investment for jobs and growth goal and u nder European territorial cooperation goal (Interreg) , when the reprogramming concerns a substantial share of the overall prog r amme . The pre-financing percentage should be further increased for certain programmes under the Investment for jobs and growth goal covering one or more NUTS2 regions bordering Russia , Belarus or Ukraine , given the adverse impact on those regions of the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine . In order to incentivise the re-programming towards key priorities in the context of the mid-term review, the additional pre- financing shou ld only be av a ilable where a certain threshold for the reallocat i on of financial resources to specific crucial priorities is reached in that context .  (15) Furthermore, to take account of the time needed to refocus investments in the context of the mid-term review and allow best use of available resources , the deadlines for the eligibility of expenditure as well as decommitment rules should be adjusted for programmes carrying out a reallocation of resources to strategic priorities in the context of the mid - term review exercise . It should also be possible to apply a maximum co-financing rate of up to 100% to priorities in programmes under the Investment for jobs and growth goal covering one or more NUTS2 regions bordering Russia , Belarus or Ukraine, given the adverse impact on those regions of the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine .  (16) The mid-term review should also be used to reinforce the crucial role of cities in delivering many Union objectives by giving Member States the possibility to reallocate f inancial resources from the ERDF to reinforce the European Urban Initiative referred to in Article 12 of Regulation (EU) 2021/1058. In addition, in order to facilitate the uptake of key innovative actions identified under the European Urban Initiative, such actions should benefit from a simplified selection procedure for support under cohesion policy programmes. Member States should also be provided with the possibility to reallocate ERDF resources from their programmes under the Investment for j obs and g rowth g oal to the Interregional Innovation Investment I nstrument referred to in Article 13 of Regulation (EU) 2021/ 1058 to enhance flexibility in the use of resources.  (17) In order to simplify delivery and accelerate investments, it is appropriate to make additional targeted changes to the regulatory framework governing the use of the JTF . In particular, the possibility for a simplified selection procedure for operations that have been attributed a Seal of Excellence should be extended to the JTF. Furthermore, the limitations for the revision of targets should be removed in order to provide for the necessary flexibility in the context of changing implementation circumstances.  (18) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely to refocus investments on critical priorities in the context of the mid-term review and to simplify and accelerate policy delivery by amending Regulations (EU) 2021/1058 and (EU) 2021/105 6 cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union . In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.  (19) Regulations (EU) 2021/1058 and (EU) 2021/1056 should therefore be amended accordingly.  (20) Given the urgen t need to enable crucial investments notably in defence capabilities in the context of pressing geopolitical challenges , this Regulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union ,  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Article 1  Regulation (EU) 2021/1058 is amended as follows:  (1) Article 3 is amended as follows:  (a) paragraph 1 is amended as follows:  (i) in point (a), the following point (vii) is added:  ‘(vii) enhancing industrial capacities to foster dual use as well as defence  capabilities.’;  (ii) in point (b), point (v) is replaced by the following:  ‘(v) promoting secure access to water, sustainable water management and water resilience;’;  (iii) the following points (xi) and (xii) are added:  ‘(xi) promoting access to affordable  housing, and related reforms;  (xii) promoting energy interconnectors and related transmission infrastructure, and the deployment of recharging infrastructure.’;  (iv) in point (c), the following point (iii) is added:  ‘(iii) developing resilient defence or dual use infrastructure to foster military mobility in the Union.’;  (v) in point (d), the following point (vii) is added:  ‘(vii) promoting access to affordable  housing, and related reforms.’;  (vi) in point (e), first subparagraph, the following point (iii) is added:  ‘(iii) fostering integrated territorial development, through access to affordable  housing, and the development of related reforms in all types of territories.’;  (vii) The following subparagraph is added in paragraph 1:  ‘Operations supported under the specific objective set out in point (c)(iii) shall primarlily focus, where relevant, on one or more of the four EU Priority Military Mobility Corridors identified by Member States in Annex II to the Military Requirements for Military Mobility within and beyond the EU as adopted by the Council on [18 March 2025 and with reference ST 6728/25 ADD1].

The proposal/initiative relates to:   a new action   a new action following a pilot project / preparatory action 8   the extension of an existing action   a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action  1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative  1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative  Recent economic and geopolitical events have brought to the front important priorities that require substantial investments. Cohesion policy provides a strong framework for such investments, and the specific investments within the scope of this amendment are already possible to a large extent under the current legal framework governing the Funds. Therefore, they are already in line with the overall objective of strengthening economic, social and territorial cohesion. However, the pace and volume of investments need to be increase. The ongoing mid-term review of the 2021-2027 cohesion policy programmes provides a crucial opportunity to assess how these programmes can help deliver on the policy objectives. Therefore, the current amendment creates incentives and flexibilities to allow Member States to put a greater focus with resources from the MFF on these priorities within a relatively short time frame.  1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, great er effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this section 'added value of EU involvement' is the value resulting from EU action, that is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.  Overall :  The amendment is designed to allow Member States to direct necessary cohesion policy funding to investments in policy areas that have been identified as priorities, and to maintain and strenghten the economic, social and territorial cohesion of the EU.  Specific objective 1:  Cohesion policy funding is vital for economic stability, fairness, and integration in the EU. It plays a primary role in reducing regional disparities and ensuring balanced development across all Member States. It ensures that all regions have the resources to grow, innovate, and adapt to future challenges while promoting EU-wide solidarity. Maintaining and accelerateing the flow of funds to the Member States from the EU budget is essential for ensuring the necessery level of public funding in Member States and to achieve the cohesion objectives enshrined in the Treaty.  Specific objective 2  Defence : The Versailles Declaration of March 2022, as well as communications JOIN(2022) 24 and COM(2022) 60 already outlined the need for the EU to step up its own preparedness, capability and resilience to better protect its citizens. The rapidly evolving geopolitical context of the past months has emphasised the need to step up the efforts. The European Council conclusions of 6 March 2025 stress “that Europe must become more sovereign, more responsible for its own defence and better equipped to act and deal autonomously with immediate and future challenges and threats with a 360° approach”. To that end, the EU will accelerate the mobilisation of the necessary instruments and financing. The European Council “calls on the Commission to propose additional funding sources for defence at EU level, including by means of additional possibilities and incentives offered to all Member States, on the basis of the principles of objectivity, non-discrimination and equal treatment of Member States, in the use of their current allocations under the relevant EU funding programmes, and to swiftly present relevant proposals”.  Competitiveness : Strengthening the competitiveness and resilience in strategic sectors and reducing the dependencies of the European economy through the green and digital transformations has been the EU compass over the last years. The STEP Regulation has already introduced increased possibilities for supporting strategic technologies and critical sectors, through the use of the cohesion policy funds. The proposal gives further impetus to use the scale of the EU to invest in areas important for the EU’s future competitiveness.  Affordable housing : The recent cost-of-living crisis has exacerbated a longstanding problem with housing affordability in the EU. The general trend can be observed in all Member States and the political guidelines acknowledge that this is putting a strain on cohesion. To that end, a taskforce has been set up within the Commission and the European Parliament has set up a special Committee on Housing. In anticipation of, and in line with the general objective of the European Affordable Housing Plan, the mid-term review of the cohesion policy programmes provides an opportunity to emphasise the importance of water resilience and to create incentives that would allow Member States to direct parts of their cohesion policy allocations to measures that support affordable housing.  Energy interconnectors and related transmission infrastructure, and recharging infrastructure : Enhancing energy security and integration, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and bolstering energy independence is crucial for the EU to support a sustainable and resilient energy system. Cohesion policy already invests in the developement of smart energy systems and in the deployment of charging infrastructure supporting electric mobility.  To accelerate investment efforts in this area and achieve greater cross-border energy integration, it is however important to provide specific incentives for the promotion of energy interconnectors and related transmission infrastructure, and the deployment of charging infrastructure supporting electric mobility.  Access to water and water management : Despite the EU’s comprehensive legal framework to protect and sustainably manage water resources, structural mismanagement of water has resulted in the continued degradation and pollution of this resource and water-related ecosystems, including coastal and marine ones. Over the last 5 years, floods, prolonged droughts and water scarcity have affected more and more areas of the EU and this is exacerbated by climate change, pollution and biodiversity loss. The transboundary nature of water challenges, their cross-cutting nature and their relevance to delivering EU policies and legislation in various domains provide a clear basis for a European strategy on water resilience. In anticipation of the strategy, the mid-term review of the cohesion policy programmes provides an opportunity to direct the necessary financing to projects that tackle security of access, sustainable water management and water resilience.  1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past  Recent amendments to the 2014-2020 and 2021-2027 Regulations in the context of the COVID-19 crisis, the military aggression of Russia in Ukraine, the energy crisis, and competitiveness (STEP) have resulted in an important uptake of funds to support relevant investments.  1.5.4. Compatibility with the multiannual financial framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments  The amendment does not alter the existing cohesion policy allocations and is intended to help accelerate investments of the Funds in an efficient and effective manner.  1.5.5. Assessment of the different available financing options, including scope for redeployment  The amendment does not alter the core structure of the existing cohesion policy regulatory framework, nor does it alter the fixed Member State allocations. It is intended to emphasise and incentivise support measures that are already possible within the scope of the funds and that are complementary to investments through other financing options either at EU level or at Member State level.  1.6. Duration of the proposal/initiative and of its financial impact  ☑ limited duration  – ☑ financial impact from 2026 to 2029 for payment appropriations. No impact on commitments appropriations.  1.7. Method(s) of budget implementation planned 9  ☑ Shared management with the Member States  2. MANAGEMENT MEASURES  2.1. Monitoring and reporting rules  The monitoring and reporting rules laid down in Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 remain fully applicable:  Programme monitoring committee: minimum once a year  Annual performance review between the Member State and the Commission  Data transmission per programme: five times per year  Annual control (audit) report.  A final performance report for each programme needs to be submitted by 15 February 2031.  2.2. Management and control system(s)  2.2.1. Justification of the budget implementation method(s), the funding implementation mechanism(s), the payment modalities and the control strategy proposed  The proposal for amendment does not alter the existing shared management budget implementation method, nor does it change the implementation mechanisms, the payment modalities or the control strategies defined in Regulation (EU) 2021/1060.  2.2.2. Information concerning the risks identified and the internal control system(s) set up to mitigate them  No specific risks have been identified. The proposal for amendment does not structurally alter the risk-management and control setup of the cohesion policy programmes, which is considered appropriate for the envisaged investments.  2.2.3. Estimation and justification of the cost-effectiveness of the controls (ratio between the control costs  and the value of the related funds managed), and assessment of the expected levels of risk of error (at payment & at closure)  The control framework of cohesion policy remains unchanged and fully applicable. This has been designed to protect the financial interests of the EU and adjusted over multiple programming periods to take into account the recommendations of ECA and OLAF.  2.3. Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities  Member States need to comply with the existing cohesion policy control framework, and need to have in place a management and control system that allows for the prevention, detection and correction and reporting on irregularities, including fraud.  3.

Those simultaneous transitions demonstrate the urgent need to close the innovation gap, to accelerate decarbonisation efforts, to reinforce economic competitiveness and to reduce external dependencies, by diversifying supply chains, scaling up domestically produced green energy, and investing in critical sectors.
(2) As the Union’s main investment instrument within the multiannual financial framework, cohesion policy drives targeted investments that contribute to economic, social and territorial cohesion, as set out in Article 3(3) of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 174 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), while at the same time addressing emerging challenges. Moreover, the mid-term review is committed to the partnership principle and the principle of multi-level governance to safeguard an effective, regional and citizen-centred implementation of cohesion policy. Therefore, any reallocation under the mid-term review should be carried out in accordance with the European code of conduct on partnership(4).
(3) The legal framework for cohesion policy programmes provides for a mid-term review in 2025, which offers a timely and unique opportunity to refocus programmes on addressing new challenges and opportunities, to accelerate implementation and to increase their effectiveness to respond to both old and new Union priorities, without prejudice to other Union legal acts or to the next multiannual financial framework.
(4) In light of the importance of horizontal enabling conditions applicable to all specific objectives and the criteria necessary for the assessment of their fulfilment, within the meaning of Article 15(1), second subparagraph, of and Annex III to Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 of the European Parliament and of the Council(5)for the effective and efficient use of the overall Union support granted by those Union Funds and the need to ensure the practical effect of those Union Funds, the amounts exceeding the flexibility amount referred to in Article 86(1), second subparagraph, of that Regulation, which correspond to specific objectives that are subject to a negative assessment by the Commission on the basis of the application of those horizontal enabling conditions should not be subject to a programme amendment or transfer on the basis of the new priorities and flexibility provided for in the amending provisions set out in this Regulation. Such a proportionate measure constitutes a necessary incentive, intended to ensure that Member State law and practice continues to comply with the horizontal enabling conditions and that the expenditure covered by the Union Funds meets the Union’s objectives.Since Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2020/2092 of the European Parliament and of the Council(6)is of horizontal application, the same requirement should apply to the amounts corresponding to commitments suspended by measures adopted on the basis of that Regulation. Amounts within the flexibility amount referred to in Article 86(1), second subparagraph, of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 and corresponding to the specific objectives subject to a negative assessment by the Commission on the basis of the application of the horizontal enabling conditions can be subject to a programme amendment or transfer on the basis of new priorities, provided that such new priorities comply with the objectives pursued by the horizontal enabling conditions.
(5) In its communication of 29 January 2025 entitled ‘A Competitiveness Compass for the EU’ as well as its communication of 26 February 2025 entitled ‘The Clean Industrial Deal: A joint roadmap for competitiveness and decarbonisation’ and the accompanying Action Plan for Affordable Energy, the Commission presented a concrete path for Europe to regain its competitiveness and secure sustainable prosperity. The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the Cohesion Fund, established by Regulation (EU) 2021/1058 of the European Parliament and of the Council(7), already support investments to climate objectives as laid down in Regulation (EU) 2021/1060. However, Member States should step up their efforts in order to ensure that decarbonisation is a driver for growth for European industries and the prosperity of European citizens by, inter alia, scaling up support for clean technology and the transition to clean energy, investing in energy infrastructure projects that can ensure a true Energy Union, and supporting decarbonisation of production processes and products.
(6) In light of the unprecedented geopolitical instability and the need for the Union to ensure its own defence and civil preparedness, cohesion policy funding should be swiftly mobilised to directly support investments in defence capabilities and civil security. It is therefore necessary to create new specific objectives for support from the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund to finance industrial capacities in the defence sector and to allow for investments in resilient defence or dual-use infrastructure, including with a view to fostering military mobility and enhancing civil preparedness including cyber and civil security that are not necessarily related to mobility, in line with the scope of those funds and the ‘do no significant harm’ principle and in cooperation with regional and local authorities. In addition, it should be possible to support civil preparedness as part of territorial and local development strategies. Industrial capacities to foster defence capabilities should relate to the technological development and production of defence products and other products for defence purposes, as defined in Council Regulation (EU) 2025/1106(8), in particular those referred to in Article 1 of that Regulation. Member States are encouraged to use the possibility provided for in the current legal framework to voluntarily transfer resources allocated to them under shared management to directly managed programmes with defence and security objectives. In that context, transfers to the military mobility envelope under the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) would ensure coordinated interventions along the military mobility corridors referred to in the Joint White Paper of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the Commission of 19 March 2025 on European Defence– Readiness 2030. When supporting such investments, Member States are to consider, where applicable, the eligibility criteria set out in Article 9 of Regulation (EU) 2021/697 of the European Parliament and of the Council(9), the eligibility rules set out in Article 16 of Regulation (EU) 2025/1106, or the relevant provisions of European defence industry programmes. Investments in dual-use infrastructure and capacities should be prioritised.
(7) Particular attention and exceptional support should be dedicated to the Union’s Eastern border regions neighbouring Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, given their unique security challenges and geopolitical significance. Those regions are particularly exposed to external threats, including hybrid attacks. Strengthening local defence capabilities and community resilience in those regions is essential not only to deter potential aggression and safeguard European security, but also to support regional development, promote social cohesion, generate employment, and improve living conditions.
(8) In the allocation and implementation of cohesion policy resources directed towards defence-related objectives, Member States should prioritise projects that promote employment, skills development and industrial diversification at regional level. Particular emphasis should be placed on supporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and regional clusters active in dual-use technologies, cybersecurity and artificial intelligence, ensuring that such investments serve the Union’s strategic interests and the objective of economic, social and territorial cohesion.
(9) Investments in upgrading transport networks to meet military requirements also deliver significant benefits for civilian mobility, economic connectivity and crisis response capacities within the Union. Such investments improve cross-border infrastructure, reduce bottlenecks, enhance preparedness and contribute to the resilience of regions and critical supply chains. Furthermore, transport hubs enabling the rapid deployment of emergency services and the distribution of essential supplies, contribute significantly to the continuity of vital functions and national security.
(10) Furthermore, in order to quickly inject liquidity to cover the most pressing needs, for investments in enhanced defence capabilities and infrastructure by, in particular, prioritising capabilities and infrastructure of a dual-use nature, and civil preparedness, additional financing possibilities should be offered. In particular, it is necessary to provide for additional one-off pre-financing of 20 % of the amounts programmed under such dedicated priorities under the relevant policy objectives of the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund and the possibility of applying a higher Union co-financing rate.
(11) The ERDF and the Cohesion Fund can, within their respective scope of support, already provide support for investments that contribute to the objectives of the Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (STEP) established by Regulation (EU) 2024/795 of the European Parliament and of the Council(10), which aims to strengthen Europe’s technological leadership. In order to provide further incentives for investments from the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund in those critical fields, the limitation for the overall contribution of the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund to those priorities should be removed and the possibility for Member States to receive a higher pre-financing for related programme amendments should be extended. The priorities which support investments contributing to STEP objectives under a request for a programme amendment that was submitted to the Commission by 31 March 2025 are to receive the exceptional one-off pre-financing applicable at the time of the submission of that request.Furthermore, the possibilities for the financing of productive investments contributing to STEP objectives in enterprises other than SMEs should apply to all Member States and regions with a GDP per capita below the EU-27 average, while preserving a focus on SMEs. Such investments should also be possible in regions where they facilitate industrial adjustment linked to the digital transition, including digital capacities in cloud computing, AI and supercomputing, and the decarbonisation and circularity of production processes and products, such as in the automotive industry or energy intensive industries. In addition, the possibility provided for investments contributing to STEP objectives to finance productive investments in enterprises other than SMEs from the Just Transition Fund (JTF) established by Regulation (EU) 2021/1056 of the European Parliament and of the Council(11)should be extended to all investments, while preserving a focus on SMEs, where such investments are necessary for, inter alia, the implementation of the just transition plan and for job creation.
(12) In order to enhance energy security, accelerate the energy transition and promote clean mobility, investments under STEP and the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Facility provided for by Regulation (EU) 2023/1804 of the European Parliament and of the Council(12)should be complemented by creating a new specific objective for the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund under policy objective 2 to promote energy interconnectors and related transmission, distribution, storage and supporting infrastructure, as well as to protect and safeguard that infrastructure and to enhance the deployment of charging infrastructure. Supporting energy infrastructure refers to any facilities, equipment, and systems that support the interconnection of Member States’ transmission systems by enabling the generation, transmission, distribution, and storage of energy. In order to accelerate investments in those fields, priorities dedicated to that specific objective should benefit from additional one-off pre-financing of 20 % of the amounts programmed under those priorities and from the possibility of applying a higher Union co-financing rate. Managing authorities are expected to aim to leverage a maximum amount of private finance, where relevant. That enhanced investment effort will enable energy-intensive sectors to access more stable and diverse energy sources in a less fragmented internal energy market, buttressing their sustainability and competitiveness. Moreover, expanding the ERDF’s support for decarbonisation projects allows energy-intensive industries to prioritise high-impact innovations that are aligned with the Union’s climate objectives.
(13) Important projects of common European interest (IPCEIs), namely projects that support and promote large-scale, cross-border projects that are considered to be essential for the economic growth, innovation, and competitiveness of the Union, are deemed to be compatible with the internal market where they enable cross-European cooperation for innovative technologies or pan-European infrastructures. To help accelerate the design of new and the implementation of existing IPCEIs, support from the ERDF for investments in projects participating in an IPCEI which the Commission has found to be compatible with the internal market pursuant to Article 107(3), point (b), TFEU having taken into account the Commission communication of 25 November 2021 entitled ‘Criteria for the analysis of the compatibility with the internal market of State aid to promote the execution of important projects of common European interest’, should be allowed in all categories of regions. Furthermore, operations contributing to an IPCEI approved by the Commission should benefit from simplified selection procedures.
(14) Affordable and sustainable housing is another challenge that has come to the forefront due to the significant increase in prices and rents in recent years. Disadvantaged groups and low-income and middle-income families are particularly affected and face more difficulties in accessing housing and a growing risk of homelessness. With a view to providing incentives for Member States and regions to double investments from the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund, within their respective scope of support, in the construction and renovation of the affordable and sustainable housing stock, including social housing, new specific objectives should be created under different policy objectives to provide flexibility for the programming of housing interventions under dedicated priorities, while acknowledging that the definition of affordability can vary according to the circumstances of each Member State. Such priorities should be compatible with Directive (EU) 2024/1275 of the European Parliament and of the Council(13)and should entail the possibility of applying a higher Union co-financing rate and of an additional one-off pre-financing of 20 % of the amounts programmed in order to alleviate the burden on public budgets in all categories of regions. For example, investments under the principles and values of the ‘New European Bauhaus’ initiative should make full use of those new possibilities. Costs resulting from the temporary renting of alternative accommodation for the occupants during the time of the renovation can also be eligible for support under such priorities. It is also appropriate to clarify the support of the JTF in that context.
(15) Water has a vital role as a resource for the security of food, energy and economic systems. Its role as a resource is also a key aspect of ensuring climate resilience. Given the challenges posed by the impact of climate change on water resources, further investments in water resilience should be encouraged. The implementation of water and marine protection legislation should be enhanced, water efficiency should be improved, water scarcity should be addressed, and progress towards a water-resilient Europe should be made, urgently. That implementation requires significant investments, including in water reuse for non-agricultural purposes, blue biotechnology, infrastructure for addressing water stress and drought prevention, the deployment of nature-based solutions, the ecological restoration of freshwater ecosystems, and the improvement of wastewater treatment. For populations living in regions particularly affected by water scarcity, desalination, if carried out in a sustainable manner, as referred to in the Commission communication of 4 June 2025 entitled ‘European Water Resilience Strategy’, can also play a key role in ensuring secure access to water and should therefore be eligible for support. It is therefore appropriate to include a reference to secure access to water, sustainable water management, including integrated water management, and water resilience in the specific objective under policy objective 2 to allow for proactive, risk-based management and increased preparedness. New dedicated priorities established for that specific objective should also benefit from additional one-off pre-financing of 20 % of the amounts programmed and the possibility of a higher co-financing rate in order to provide incentives for crucial investments in that field. It should also be possible to provide support from the JTF for water-related investments where such investments address acute water stress, enhance climate resilience, and support the transition to a sustainable and diversified local economy, even when not directly linked to land restoration projects.
(16) In order to enable Member States to carry out meaningful reprogramming in the context of the mid-term review and to focus resources on those new strategic Union priorities, additional restrictions should be lifted. As regards thematic concentration requirements, it is appropriate to allow Member States to count amounts programmed for new strategic priorities, regardless of whether Member States comply with thematic concentration at national level or at the level of category of region, including those contributing to STEP objectives, towards the amounts required to ensure compliance with thematic concentration requirements. The flexibility with regard to thematic concentration requirements should be accompanied by some flexibility regarding the calculation of the climate contribution for the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund pursuant to Article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060, while respecting the overall requirements of that Article. In addition, Member States should also be given the possibility of contributing resources from the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund to the Member State compartment of the InvestEU Fund established by Regulation (EU) 2021/523 of the European Parliament and of the Council(14)to deploy them through the financial instrument provided for in the InvestEU Programme.Finally, in order to allow for a comprehensive reprogramming towards the new strategic priorities in the context of the mid-term review, Member States should benefit from additional time to complement their assessment of the outcome of the mid-term review and their submission of related programme amendments. That additional time for reprogramming should also apply to JTF resources where they are included in a programme together with ERDF and Cohesion Fund resources or resources of the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+) established by Regulation (EU) 2021/1057 of the European Parliament and of the Council(15). Amendments to programmes under the European territorial cooperation goal (Interreg) are submitted in accordance with Article 19 of Regulation (EU) 2021/1059 of the European Parliament and of the Council(16).
(17) In order to accelerate the implementation of cohesion policy programmes more generally and inject the necessary liquidity for key investments to be implemented, additional one-off pre-financing for the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund should be paid for programmes under both the Investment for jobs and growth goal and under Interreg when the reprogramming concerns a substantial share of the overall programme. The pre-financing percentage should be further increased for certain programmes under the Investment for jobs and growth goal covering one or more NUTS level 2 regions bordering Russia, Belarus or Ukraine, given the adverse impact on those regions of the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine. In order to encourage re-programming towards key priorities in the context of the mid-term review, the additional one-off pre-financing should be available only where a certain threshold for the reallocation of financial resources to specific crucial priorities is reached in that context.
(18) To take account of the time needed to refocus investments in the context of the mid-term review and allow best use of available resources, the final date for the eligibility of expenditure and the decommitment rules should be adjusted for programmes that carry out a reallocation of resources to strategic priorities in the context of the mid-term review exercise. It should also be possible to apply a higher co-financing rate to priorities in programmes under the Investment for jobs and growth goal covering one or more NUTS level 2 regions bordering Russia, Belarus or Ukraine, taking into account the adverse impact on those regions of the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine and with due regard to the need for timely closure, the commencement of new programmes and the full absorption of programme funding.
(19) The mid-term review should also be used to reinforce the crucial role of cities and functional urban areas in delivering many Union objectives by giving Member States the possibility, in close cooperation with the regional and local authorities and keeping in mind the regional specificities and the scope of the cohesion policy, of reallocating financial resources from the ERDF to reinforce the European Urban Initiative referred to in Article 12 of Regulation (EU) 2021/1058. In addition, in order to facilitate the uptake of key innovative actions identified under the European Urban Initiative, such actions should benefit from a simplified selection procedure for support under cohesion policy programmes. To enhance flexibility in the use of resources, Member States should also be provided with the possibility of reallocating ERDF resources from their programmes under the Investment for jobs and growth goal to the Interregional Innovation Investment Instrument referred to in Article 13 of Regulation (EU) 2021/1058.
(20) In order to simplify delivery and accelerate investments, it is appropriate to make additional targeted changes to the regulatory framework governing the use of the JTF. In particular, the possibility for a simplified selection procedure for operations that have been attributed a Seal of Excellence should be extended to the JTF. Furthermore, the limitations for the revision of targets should be removed in order to provide for the necessary flexibility in the context of changing implementation circumstances.
(21) To support Member States in their swift and correct reprogramming, the Commission should provide timely and clear technical clarifications and support to managing authorities, including through a structured system, by answering technical, legal and procedural questions, in particular with regard to measures introduced by this Regulation.
(22) Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely to refocus investments on critical priorities in the context of the mid-term review and to simplify and accelerate policy delivery by amending Regulations (EU) 2021/1058 and (EU) 2021/1056, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
(23) Regulations (EU) 2021/1058 and (EU) 2021/1056 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(24) Given the urgent need to enable crucial investments, in particular in defence capabilities in the context of pressing geopolitical challenges, this Regulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication in theOfficial Journal of the European Union,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

Done at Brussels, 18 September 2025.",https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202501914,"The European Commission has proposed amendments to the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), Cohesion Fund, and Just Transition Fund as part of a mid-term review aimed at addressing strategic challenges and priorities. This proposal seeks to realign resources to enhance the EU's defense capabilities, competitiveness, and strategic autonomy, while also focusing on emerging priorities such as clean industrial deals and climate resilience. Recognizing that the current regulatory framework is outdated due to recent geopolitical and economic shifts, the Commission suggests adjustments to increase flexibility and accelerate investments in critical areas like technological leadership, energy independence, and climate resilience.

The proposal addresses challenges faced by energy-intensive industries, such as higher energy costs and increased international competition, which threaten Europe's decarbonization and resilience goals. To counter these challenges, the cohesion funds are encouraged to support investments aligned with climate objectives, accelerating efforts to ensure decarbonization drives growth for European industries. Member States are urged to invest in projects contributing to the climate and energy transition, with support for projects within the Strategic Energy Technology Plan (STEP) being made possible in all regions, including more developed ones, as allowed by state aid rules.

To provide a flexible financial support framework, the Commission proposes two new specific objectives within the ERDF. The first allows Member States to reprogram funds under their 2021-2027 programs to enhance productive capacities in the defense sector, without geographic or enterprise size restrictions. The second objective focuses on building resilient defense or dual-use infrastructure to improve military mobility in the EU.

","The European Parliament and the Council have adopted a regulation amending the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), Cohesion Fund, and Just Transition Fund to address strategic challenges identified during a mid-term review. This amendment aims to enhance the EU's strategic autonomy, resilience, and competitiveness amid geopolitical uncertainties and transitions towards green, social, and technological advancements. Key initiatives include mobilizing cohesion policy funding to support investments in defense capabilities and civil security, with a focus on military mobility, cybersecurity, and regional development, particularly in the Union’s Eastern border regions. The regulation prioritizes projects that enhance employment, skills development, and industrial diversification, supporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in dual-use technologies, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence. Additionally, it encourages investments in transport networks to meet military requirements while benefiting civilian mobility and economic connectivity. The regulation extends financing options, including one-off pre-financing and higher Union co-financing rates, to facilitate these investments. It also supports investments aligned with the Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (STEP), promoting energy interconnectors, transmission, distribution, and storage infrastructure, and enhancing the deployment of charging infrastructure. Furthermore, the regulation encourages investments in important projects of common European interest (IPCEIs) to support large-scale, cross-border projects essential for the EU's economic growth and competitiveness. To address the challenge of affordable and sustainable housing, new specific objectives have been created to incentivize investments in the construction and renovation of housing stock. The regulation also emphasizes enhancing"

a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulation (EU) 2021/1057 establishing the European Social Fund + (ESF+) as regards specific measures to address strategic challenges  EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM  1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  The mid-term review of cohesion policy presents an opportunity for Member States to redirect 2021-2027 resources towards investment in defence capabilities, for the competitiveness, preparedness and strategic autonomy of the EU and in other emerging priorities, including clean industrial deal objectives by submitting corresponding programme amendments to the Commission. Strengthening these dimensions requires having people with the right skills. In the current demographic context, increasing skills and labour shortages are a main impediment for growth and economic adjustment. Investing in skills development and labour mobility is top priority.  The framework for cohesion policy investments in people set out in the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+) regulation is not sufficiently aligned with these new priorities. The exceptional challenges the Union is confronted with requires additional focus, flexibility and a reinforcement of incentives. The proposed adjustments will help steer reprogramming towards emerging priorities and will support speeding up implementation. This proposal sets out adjustments to the ESF+ regulation to achieve these objectives.  Aligning cohesion policy investments to new priorities  In recent years, geopolitical dynamics have been marked by profound uncertainty, necessitating a fundamental re-evaluation of the EU’s strategic autonomy. These shifts are unfolding alongside the green, social, and technological transitions, which are rapidly reshaping the world around us. The challenges posed by these simultaneous transformations were comprehensively analysed in the report on the “Future of European Competitiveness”, published in September 2024. The report underscores the urgent need to close the innovation gap, align decarbonisation efforts with economic competitiveness, and reduce external dependencies by diversifying supply chains and investing in critical sectors.  In response, several major initiatives have already been launched to enhance the EU’s economic resilience and strategic autonomy. These include the “Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform” (STEP), which aims to strengthen Europe’s technological leadership; “REPowerEU"", designed to reduce reliance on external energy sources and accelerate the green transition; to complete interventions already underway via cohesion policy programmes and the “Recovery and Resilience Facility” (RRF), to support structural changes in Member States and regions as well as to enhance their resilience.  As the EU’s main investment instrument within the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), cohesion policy plays a crucial role in supporting these priorities. It drives targeted investments that contribute to economic, social and territorial cohesion while at the same time addressing emerging challenges. It contributes to Europe’s economic transformation, including through innovation, strengthening competitiveness. However, the regulatory framework governing the 2021-2027 cohesion policy funds was drafted, negotiated and adopted before the series of major geopolitical and economic events that have since reshaped some of the EU’s strategic political priorities.  Similarly, the Partnership Agreements and the national and regional cohesion policy programmes were developed and approved within this same timeframe, hence reflecting the priorities set at the time. Given the evolving global and regional context, the 2025 mid-term review presents a critical opportunity to assess their implementation and the effectiveness of their contribution to the evolving priorities. This review will help determine the extent to which cohesion policy programmes can directly and swiftly respond to rapidly changing political, economic and social realities.  At the same time, it has become evident that the early implementation of the 2021-2027 cohesion policy programmes has faced challenges which have not been conducive to a swift uptake and rapid disbursement of the funds, leading to delays in their implementation compared to previous programming periods. These delays come at a time when strong and accelerated investment is essential to support economic resilience and competitiveness.  Against this backdrop, the Commission is proposing targeted amendments to Regulation (EU) 2021/1057. These changes aim to adjust investment priorities with the evolving economic, societal, environmental and geopolitical context while at the same time introducing greater flexibility and incentives to facilitate and encourage the rapid deployment of much-needed resources. By refining the 2021-2027 cohesion policy framework, the EU can ensure that its investment mechanisms remain agile and responsive, enabling a more effective response to current and future challenges.  In order for Member States to make effectively use of the possibilities provided in this proposal, they are proposed to be allowed to re-submit their mid-term review proposal by 2 months after the entry into force of the present proposal for amendment to Regulation (EU) 2021/1057. Any programme amendment that would be carried out pursuant to the new priorities and flexibilities, shall be without prejudice to the application of any measures adopted under Regulation 2020/2092 and to the compliance by relevant programmes with the priorities under Article 15 of Regulation 2021/1060. In this context the Commission will closely monitor the conformity of the programmes with the requirements of relevant EU law.  Adaptation of workers, enterprises and entrepeneurs to change contributing to decarbonisation and resilience of production capacities  Faced with high energy costs, fierce global competition and significant threats to the rules-based international order governing international trade, European industries need the adjust. They need workers with the right skills set, the definition of which is rapidly evolving. Ensuring that workers have access to obtaining the right skills through re- and upskilling measures and supporting mobility of (high skilled) workers between industries, as structural change is taking place at an unprecedented pace, requires immediate action.  Europe’s competitive strength lies in its people. Our human capital is key to the EU’s prosperity, its economic resilience to increasing our productivity growth, and to fostering cohesion . The EU's workforce must have the necessary skills to support the growing defence industry, strengthening Europe’s preparedness and security, as well as the transition to a low-carbon economy, including skills in clean technologies, digitalisation, and entrepreneurship. The Clean Industrial Deal 1 outlines concrete actions to turn decarbonisation into a driver of growth for European industries.  Defence and security  In the face of unprecedented geopolitical instability, the European Union must now make crucial decisions to ensure its security. To guarantee its own defence deterrence, and security, Europe must be prepared to enter a new era by significantly increasing its support for the development of the defence capabilities and the competitiveness of the EU defence industry. This effort will enable the Union to address the short-term urgency of supporting Ukraine while ensuring the continent’s long-term stability.  The Commission has proposed to the European Council an immediate response plan — REARM Europe — amounting to EUR 800 billion, by activating all available financial levers to swiftly and significantly support investment in European defence capacities. Among these levers, the Union budget can further contribute to this collective effort through a new dedicated defence instrument and the strengthening of the European Defence Industry Programme (EDIP).  To complement these tools and further incentivise Member States to directly support defence investments, it is essential that cohesion policy funding can be swiftly mobilised. These investments will reinforce the resilience and EU competitiveness while promoting regional development and growth. They will also tackle the dual challenge faced by the Union’s regions bordering Russia, Belarus and Ukraine: strengthening security while revitalising their economies.  The right skills are crucial to an effective defence capacity. The capacity of the defence industry to recruit skilled workers, and re- and upskill workers, is a sine qua non for the ability to ramp up production in a very short timeframe. The Union of Skills sets out actions to address skills gaps and shortages in Europe . The Commission will also develop a Skills Guarantee pilot. This scheme will offer workers involved in restructuring processes, or at risk of unemployment, the opportunity to develop further their careers in another company or another sector. This is particularly important in the present circumstances. Furthermore, the Pact for Skills, has established a large-scale partnership on the defence ecosystem 2 . Through skills forecasting, it supports collective anticipation of the skills gaps Europe will face, taking into account industry skills needs and demographic skills forecasts for the next five to ten years. It aims to upgrade upskilling and reskilling programmes to make them more attractive by better engaging and developing talent and improving its retention.  In this context, the ESF+ will actively facilitate the development of skills in the defence industry by providing additional flexibilities to implementation, including increased pre-financing, exemption from the calculation of thematic concentration as well as increased level of co-financing.  Eastern border regions  Given the challenges of the Eastern border regions since the Russian aggression against Ukraine, programmes under the Investment for jobs and growth goal with NUTS 2 regions that have borders with Russia, Belarus or Ukraine, should benefit from the possibility of a one-off 9.5% pre-financing of the programme allocation in 2026 and a 100% Union financing.  Greater flexibility and simplification for accelerating investments  Halfway in the 2021-2027 programming period, the level of payments claimed by the Member States to the Commission is low, owing to a combination of factors: the late adoption of the regulations governing the policy; the need to face successive crises from the COVID-19 pandemic to the war against Ukraine, and to the energy crisis; the pressure to close the previous programming period; and the priority given to implement the instruments of NGEU, given their shorter implementation timeframe. All this has in turn put a strain on the administrative capacities of Member States’ authorities to design and quickly deliver investments. Notwithstanding a rapid acceleration experienced over last year with project selection just above 40% of the allocations, cohesion policy implementation should rapidly pick up pace in a context where the Union is facing a range of new challenges requiring rapid responses. The Commission therefore proposes a set of measures aiming at further enhancing the flexibility and simplification of the use of cohesion policy support for accelerating investments:  – To avoid that programme implementation is delayed because of national budgetary constraints, and to expand the financial capacity Member States to address the newly emerging challenges, the Commission proposes to provide a one-off 4.5% pre-financing provided from the ESF+ in 2026 to all programmes that reallocate at least 15% of their resources for the new priorities and STEP in the context of the mid-term review process.  – The pre-financing percentage is proposed to be increased to 9.5% in 2026 for programmes covering one or more NUTS2 regions bordering Russia, Belarus or Ukraine acknowledging the specific challenges these regions have face since the Russian aggression in Ukraine .  – To avoid that the risk of delays and corresponding loss of funds reduces willingness to undertake programme amendments and to ensure the proper implementation of the operations concerned, the Commission proposes to extend the time limit for using the ESF+ resources and extend the end date for eligibility by an additional year. This flexibility is proposed to be made available only for programmes that proposed amendments resulting in reallocation of at least 15% of the resources for the new priorities and STEP in the context of the mid-term review exercise, once approved.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  The proposal is consistent with the objectives followed by the cohesion policy funds as well as with the latest Commission communication on a reform agenda for Cohesion policy and is limited to a targeted amendment of Regulation (EU) 2021/1057. Consistency with other Union policies  The proposal is limited to a targeted amendment of Regulation (EU) 2021/1057 and maintains consistency with other Union policies.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  The proposal is based on Articles 164, 175, 177 and 322 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  The proposal to encourage Member States to further align their cohesion policy programmes to addressing strategic challenges and to refocus resources to new priorities while ensuring greater flexibility to accelerate implementation, requires amendments to Regulation (EU) 2021/1057. The same result cannot be achieved through actions at national level.  • Proportionality  The proposal aims at incentivising Member States to further align their cohesion policy programmes to addressing strategic challenges and refocus resources to new priorities as well as providing greater flexibility for accelerating investments. The measures do not go beyond what is necessary to achieve these goals.  • Choice of the instrument  A Regulation is the appropriate instrument as it provides directly applicable rules for the support.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  N/A  • Stakeholder consultations  N/A  • Collection and use of expertise  N/A  • Impact assessment  An impact assessment has been carried out to prepare the proposal for Regulation (EU) 2021/1057. The limited and targeted changes do not require a separate impact assessment.  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  N/A  • Fundamental rights  N/A  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  The proposal concerns cohesion policy programmes from the 2021-2027 period and will result in additional pre-financing to be paid under the ESF+ in 2026. This additional pre-financing will lead to frontloading of payment appropriations to 2026 compared to a no policy-change scenario and is budgetary neutral over the 2021-2027 period. Based on the estimated uptake of the proposal as well as taking into account payment forecasts and implementation shifts , the net budgetary impact is estimated to EUR 500 million that will be included in the draft budget 2026.  The possibility to apply for an increased Union financing rate for investments under the dedicated priorities and for programmes covering Eastern border regions will also lead to a partial front-loading of payments, followed by lower payments at a later stage as the overall envelope is unchanged. The actual impact will highly depend on the Member States’ uptake.  The proposed modification does not require changes in the Multiannual Financial Framework annual ceilings for commitments and payments as per Annex I to Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2020/2093.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  The implementation of the measure will be monitored and reported upon in the framework of the general reporting mechanisms established in Regulation (EU) 2021/1060.  • Explanatory documents (for directives)  N/A  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  The proposal involves the amendment of Regulation (EU) 2021/1057 as regards the ESF+ in order to address strategic challenges and allow for Member States to refocus their resources to new priorities.  Defence  It allows for a focused support to development of skills in the defence industry under a dedicated priority that benefits from further flexibilities that include an increased pre-financing on the allocation of the priority, exemption from the calculation of amounts towards thematic concentration and an increased level of co-financing. Nevertheless, such flexibilities are conditioned to reallocating a minimum amount of the programme resources to new priorities.  Adaptation of workers, enterprises and entrepeneurs to change contributing to decarbonisation of production capacities  It allows for a focused support to skilling, up-skilling and re-skilling with a view to adaptation of workers, enterprises and entrepeneurs to change contributing to decarbonisation of production capacities.under a dedicated priority that benefits from further flexibilities that include an increased pre-financing on the allocation of the priority and increased level of co-financing. Nevertheless, such flexibilities are conditioned to reallocating a minimum amount of the programme resources to new priorities.  Facilitating the refocusing of resources by Member States  In order that the Member State could effectively make use of the new priorities and flexibilities, Member States will be allowed to re-submit their assessment to the mid-term review accompanied by a request for programme amendment to establish any of the newly introduced dedicated priorities.  To help accelerate the implementation of the ESF+, all programmes that establish any of the newly introduced dedicated priorities and STEP and reallocate at least 15% of their resources, would receive an additional one-off pre-financing of 4.5% on the basis of their amended programme budget.  Given the challenges of the Eastern border regions since the Russian aggression against Ukraine, programmes financed by the ESF+ with NUTS 2 regions that have borders with Russia, Belarus or Ukraine, should benefit from the possibility of a one-off 9.5% pre-financing and a 100% Union financing. Where the corresponding programme covers the entire territory of the Member State, these financial flexibilities should only apply if the programme covering the entire territory of the Member State is the only programme in the Member State that includes the concerned NUTS 2 regions.  In addition, the end-date for eligibility of expenditure is extended by one additional year for all cohesion policy programmes where programme amendments establishing any of the newly introduced dedicated priorities and reallocating at least 15% of the financial resources of the programme to those priorities have been approved.  2025/0085 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulation (EU) 2021/1057 establishing the European Social Fund + (ESF+) as regards specific measures to address strategic challenges  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 164, 175, 177  and Article 322thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 3 ,  Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions 4 ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) Given the major geopolitical and economic events that have reshaped some of the Union’s strategic political priorities, it is necessary to provide for possibilities for Member States to address those strategic challenges and to refocus their resources to newly emerging priorities.  (2) The W hite paper for European Defence – Readiness 2030 5 paves the way for a true European defence union , including by suggesting to Member States to heavily invest into defence and the defence industry. In that regard, the Communication from  the Commission - the Union of Skills of 5 March 2025 6 (‘the Union of Skills Communication’) sets out actions to address skills gaps and shortages in the Union , also through the Pact for Skills Initiative referred to in that Communication , and its large - scale partnerships, including one on the defence ecosystem. Therefore, it is appropriate to include incentives for the ESF+ established by Regulation (EU) 2021/1057 of the European Parliament and of the Council 7 to facilitate the development of skills in the defence industry.  (3) It is already possible to support the adaptation o f workers, entrepreneurs and enterprises to change under the ESF+ . In line with the decarbonisation measures proposed by the Communication from the Commission – the Clean Industrial Deal: A joint roadmap for competitiveness and decarbonisation of 26 February 2025 8 and t o further facilitate industrial adjustment linked to the decarbonisation of production processes and products, in the context of the objective of providing lifelong opportunities to regularly upskill and reskill people, as set out in the Union of Skills Communication, including through a newly proposed Skills Guarantee, the ESF+ should facilitate the skilling, job maintenance and job creation throughout the decarbonisation process by providing flexibilities to implementation.  (4) It is already possible, under ESF+, to support investments contributing to the objectives of the ‘Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform’ (STEP) established by Regulation (EU) 2024/795 of the European Parliament and of the Council 9 which aims to strengthen the Union’s technological leadership. In order to further incentivise investments from the ESF+ in those critical fields, the possibility for Member States to receive a higher pre-financing for related programme amendments should be extended.  (5) In order to enable Member States to carry out a meaningful reprogramming and focus resources on strategic Union priorities set out in recitals 2, 3 and 4 without causing further delays in implementation, it is appropriate to provide for further flexibilities. The mid-term review should serve as an opportunity to address emerging strategic challenges and new priorities therefore, Member States should benefit from additional time to complete the assessment of the outcome of the mid - term review and the submission of related programme amendments  (6) In order to accelerate the implementation of cohesion policy programmes and alleviate the pressure on national budgets and to inject the necessary liquidity for the implementation of key investments, an additional one-off pre-financing from the ESF+ should be paid for programmes. Because of the adverse impact of the Russian aggression in Ukraine, the pre-financing percentage should be further increased for certain programmes covering one or more NUTS2 regions bordering Russia, Belarus or Ukraine. In order to incentivise the re-programming towards key priorities in the context of the mid-term review , the additional pre-financing should only be available where a certain threshold for the reallocation of financial resources to specific crucial priorities is reached.  (7) Furthermore, to take account of the time needed to refocus investments and to allow best use of available resources, the deadlines for the eligibility of expenditure and the decommitment rules should be adjusted for programmes carrying out a reallocation of resources to strategic priorities.  (8) It should also be possible to apply a maximum co-financing rate of up to 100% to priorities in programmes covering one or more NUTS2 regions bordering Russia, Belarus or Ukraine, given the adverse impact of the Russian aggression on th o se regions.  (9) Since the objective s of this Regulation, namely to address strategic challenges, refocus investments on critical new priorities and simplify and accelerate policy delivery , cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union . In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.  (10) Regulation (EU) 2021/105 7 should therefore be amended accordingly .  (11) [ Given the urgen t need to enable crucial investments in skills in the defence industry as well as in adaptation to change linked to decarbonisation in the context of pressing strategic geopolitical challenges , this Regulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union ,]  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Article 1  Regulation (EU) 2021/1057 is amended as follows:  (1) the following Article 5a is inserted :  ‘ Article 5a  Specific provisions linked to the implementation of ESF+ strand under shared management  (1) In 2026, the Commission shall pay 4,5 % of the total support from the ESF+ as set out in the decision approving the programme amendment as additional one-off pre-financing. The one-off pre-financing percentage in 2026 shall be increased to 9,5% for programmes covering one or more NUTS2 regions bordering Russia, Belarus or Ukraine, provided the programme does not cover the entire territory of the Member State. Where, in a Member State, NUTS 2 regions bordering Russia, Belarus or Ukraine are included exclusively in programmes covering the entire territory of that Member State, the increased pre-financing set out in this paragraph shall apply to those programmes.  The additional pre-financing referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph shall only apply where reallocations of at least 15% of the financial resources of the programme to one or more dedicated priorities established in accordance with  Articles 12a, 12c and 12d have been approved; provided that the request for a programme amendment is submitted by 31 December 2025.  The pre-financing due to the Member State which results from programme amendments pursuant to reallocation to the priorities referred to in the second subparagraph of this paragraph shall be counted  as payments made in 2025 for the purposes of calculating the amounts to be de-committed in accordance with Article 105 of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 , provided the request for programme amendment was submitted in 2025.

FRAMEWORK OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE  1.1. Title of the proposal/initiative  Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL amending Regulation (EU) 2021/1057 as regards specific measures to address strategic challenges  1.2. Policy area(s) concerned  Cohesion policy: European Social Fund Plus (ESF+)  1.3. Objective(s)  1.3.1. General objective(s)  The cohesion policy funds, including the ESF+, provide financing in support of the harmonious development of the EU, through actions that lead to the strengthening of its economic, social and territorial cohesion. In support of this overarching objective, the Funds also contribute to advancing key policy objectives, including strengthening the overall competitiveness and the strategic autonomy of the EU, and addressing challenges and opportunities that are associated with the green, digital and social transitions.  1.3.2. Specific objective(s)  Specific objective No 1  Accelerate the implementation of 2021-2027 cohesion policy programmes financed by the ESF+ by enhancing the flexibility and provide areas of simplification for the use of cohesion policy funds.  Specific objective No 2  Provide support from the ESF+ under the 2021-2027 programmes to development of skills in the defence industry as a short-term reaction to recent geopolitical events by providing additional possibilities for Member States to refocus resources to the defence sector.  Further facilitate industrial adjustment linked to the decarbonisation of production processes and products by providing additional possibilities for Member States to refocus resources to skilling, up-skilling and re-skilling with a view to adaptation of workers, enterprises and entrepreneurs to change throughout the decarbonisation process.  Address specific territorial challenges of the Regions bordering Ukraine, Russia and Belarus.  1.3.3. Expected result(s) and impact  Specify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.  Specific objective No 1  Maximising the use of the resources allocated to the ESF+ under the 2021-2027 MFF.  Specific objective No 2  Increased level of skills matching the demand of the defence industry as well as in sectors affected by the decarbonisation process.  Increased support to address the specific challenges of regions bordering Russia, Belarus and Ukraine.  1.3.4. Indicators of performance  Specify the indicators for monitoring progress and achievements.  Specific objective No 1  Financial data on the amounts related to operations selected and implemented by Member States and on disbursements made from the EU budget to Member States.  Specific objective No 2  Common Output Indicator – Total number of participants  1.4. The proposal/initiative relates to:   a new action  X a new action following a pilot project / preparatory action 10   the extension of an existing action   a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action  1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative  1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative  Recent economic and geopolitical events have brought to the front important priorities that require refocusing of resources within cohesion policy, notably in the ESF+. The specific actions within the scope of this amendment are already possible to be financed under the current legal framework governing the ESF+. Therefore, they are already in line with the overall objective of strengthening economic, social and territorial cohesion. However, the pace and volume of investments need to be increased. The ongoing mid-term review of the 2021-2027 cohesion policy programmes provides a crucial opportunity to assess how these programmes can help deliver on the newly emerging priorities. Therefore, the current amendment creates incentives and flexibilities to allow Member States to put a greater focus with resources from the MFF on these priorities within a relatively short time frame.  1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, great er effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this section 'added value of EU involvement' is the value resulting from EU action, that is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.  The amendment is designed to allow Member States to direct necessary cohesion policy funding to investments in policy areas that have been identified as priorities, and to maintain and strengthen the economic, social and territorial cohesion of the EU.  Specific objective 1:  Cohesion policy funding is vital for economic stability, fairness, and integration in the EU. It plays a primary role in reducing regional disparities and ensuring balanced development across all Member States. It ensures that all regions have the resources to grow, innovate, and adapt to future challenges while promoting EU-wide solidarity. Maintaining and accelerating the flow of funds to the Member States from the EU budget is essential for ensuring the necessary level of public funding in Member States and to achieve the cohesion objectives enshrined in the Treaty.  Specific objective 2:  Development of skills in the defence industry : The Versailles Declaration of March 2022, as well as communications JOIN(2022) 24 and COM(2022) 60 already outlined the need for the EU to step up its own preparedness, capability and resilience to better protect its citizens. The rapidly evolving geopolitical context of the past months has emphasised the need to step up the efforts. The European Council conclusions of 6 March 2025 stress “that Europe must become more sovereign, more responsible for its own defence and better equipped to act and deal autonomously with immediate and future challenges and threats with a 360° approach”. To that end, the EU will accelerate the mobilisation of the necessary instruments and financing. The European Council “calls on the Commission to propose additional funding sources for defence at EU level, including by means of additional possibilities and incentives offered to all Member States, on the basis of the principles of objectivity, non-discrimination and equal treatment of Member States, in the use of their current allocations under the relevant EU funding programmes, and to swiftly present relevant proposals”.  Adaptation of workers, entrepreneurs and enterprises to change throughout the decarbonisation process: Strengthening the competitiveness and resilience in strategic sectors and reducing the dependencies of the European economy through the green and digital transformations has been the EU compass over the last years. The proposal gives further impetus to use the scale of the EU to invest in areas important for the EU’s future competitiveness.  1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past  Recent amendments to the 2014-2020 and 2021-2027 Regulations in the context of the COVID-19 crisis, the military aggression of Russia in Ukraine, the energy crisis, and competitiveness (STEP) have resulted in an important uptake of funds to support relevant investments.  1.5.4. Compatibility with the multiannual financial framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments  The amendment does not alter the existing cohesion policy allocations and is intended to help accelerate investments of the Funds in an efficient and effective manner.  1.5.5. Assessment of the different available financing options, including scope for redeployment  The amendment does not alter the core structure of the existing cohesion policy regulatory framework, including for the ESF+, nor does it alter the fixed Member State allocations. It is intended to emphasise and incentivise support to measures that are already possible within the scope of the ESF+ and that are complementary to investments through other financing options either at EU level or at Member State level.  1.6. Duration of the proposal/initiative and of its financial impact  X limited duration  –  financial impact from 2026 to 2029 for payment appropriations. No impact on  commitment appropriations.  1.7. Method(s) of budget implementation planned 11  –  Shared management with the Member States  Comments  2. MANAGEMENT MEASURES  2.1. Monitoring and reporting rules  The monitoring and reporting rules laid down in Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 remain fully applicable:  Programme monitoring committee: minimum once a year  Annual performance review between the Member State and the Commission  Data transmission per programme: five times per year  Annual control (audit) report.  A final performance report for each programme needs to be submitted by 15 February 2031  2.2. Management and control system(s)  2.2.1. Justification of the budget implementation method(s), the funding implementation mechanism(s), the payment modalities and the control strategy proposed  The proposal for amendment does not alter the existing shared management budget implementation method, nor does it change the implementation mechanisms, the payment modalities or the control strategies defined in Regulation (EU) 2021/1060.  2.2.2. Information concerning the risks identified and the internal control system(s) set up to mitigate them  No specific risks have been identified. The proposal for amendment does not structurally alter the risk-management and control setup of the cohesion policy programmes, which is considered appropriate for the envisaged investments.  2.2.3. Estimation and justification of the cost-effectiveness of the controls (ratio between the control costs  and the value of the related funds managed), and assessment of the expected levels of risk of error (at payment & at closure)  The control framework of cohesion policy remains unchanged and fully applicable. This has been designed to protect the financial interests of the EU and adjusted over multiple programming periods to take into account the recommendations of ECA and OLAF.  2.3. Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities  Member States need to comply with the existing cohesion policy control framework, and need to have in place a management and control system that allows for the prevention, detection and correction and reporting on irregularities, including fraud.  3.

of 18 September 2025
amending Regulation (EU) 2021/1057 establishing the European Social FundPlus(ESF+) as regards specific measures to address strategic challenges
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 164, 175, 177 and 322 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions(2),
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure(3),
Whereas:
(1) Given recent major geopolitical and economic events that have reshaped some of the Union’s strategic political priorities, it is necessary to provide for more structural possibilities to allow Member States to address those pressing strategic geopolitical challenges and to refocus their resources on newly emerging priorities.
(2) The main objectives of the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+), established by means of Regulation (EU) 2021/1057 of the European Parliament and of the Council(4), are to support Member States and regions to achieve social inclusion and social cohesion, to activate the labour market, and to deliver on the principles and the headline targets of the European Pillar of Social Rights. The reprogramming of resources under the ESF+ should not undermine its social approach, but should strengthen its capacity to combat inequality.
(3) In its opinion of 6 May 2025 on the legislative proposal forming the basis for this Regulation, the European Court of Auditors stressed that cohesion policy is often used as an emergency response tool, which risks undermining its primary longer-term aims and objectives. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that any measures taken in the context of emergencies do not obstruct the objectives of cohesion policy.
(4) The Union and its Member States continue to show that they are able to react rapidly to geopolitical events and that they are willing to use sufficient financial resources towards strengthening the defence industry of the Union. At the same time, it is of utmost importance to continue to invest in the social objectives of the Union through the ESF+, as social cohesion is a cornerstone of the Union’s democratic and societal resilience, which is essential for the purpose of facing threats of aggression.
(5) The Joint White Paper of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the Commission of 19 March 2025 on European Defence – Readiness 2030 paves the way for a true European defence union, including by suggesting to Member States to heavily invest in defence and cybersecurity, including dual-use capabilities and civil preparedness, which should be carried out together with social spending, creating employment and up-skilling and re-skilling opportunities. In that regard, the Commission communication of 5 March 2025 entitled ‘The Union of Skills’ (the ‘Union of Skills Communication’) sets out actions to address skills gaps and skills shortages in the Union, including through the strengthened and streamlined Pact for Skills, referred to in that communication, as well as its large-scale partnerships in particular the Large Scale Partnership for Aerospace and Defence. In that context, it is appropriate to incorporate incentives into the ESF+ with a view to facilitating the development of skills in the defence industry. In order to provide more flexibility for Member States to reallocate resources to the development of skills in the defence industry, the amounts allocated to such development should not be subject to thematic concentration requirements, but should be taken into account when contributing to such requirements.
(6) The ESF+ can be used to support the adaptation of workers, enterprises and entrepreneurs to change. In line with the decarbonisation measures proposed in the Commission communication of 26 February 2025 entitled ‘The Clean Industrial Deal: A joint roadmap for competitiveness and decarbonisation’ and in order to further facilitate industrial adjustment linked to the decarbonisation of production processes and products, the ESF+ should facilitate skilling, job maintenance and quality job creation throughout the decarbonisation process, by providing flexibility in the implementation of that process. This should be carried out in line with the objective of providing lifelong opportunities to regularly upskill and reskill people set out in the Union of Skills Communication, including through a Skills Guarantee. Particular consideration should be given to the specific needs and circumstances of less developed regions and rural areas, which should benefit from the green transition, and to ensuring their integration into the Union’s broader economic, social and environmental development.
(7) In light of the importance of horizontal enabling conditions applicable to all specific objectives and the criteria necessary for the assessment of their fulfilment, within the meaning of Article 15(1), second subparagraph, of and Annex III to Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 of the European Parliament and of the Council(5), for the effective and efficient use of the overall Union support granted by those Union Funds and the need to ensure the practical effect of those Union Funds, the amounts exceeding the flexibility amount referred to in Article 86(1), second subparagraph, of that Regulation, which correspond to specific objectives that are subject to a negative assessment by the Commission on the basis of the application of those horizontal enabling conditions, should not be subject to a programme amendment or transfer on the basis of the new priorities and flexibility provided for in this Regulation. Such a proportionate measure constitutes a necessary incentive, intended to ensure that Member State law and practice continues to comply with the horizontal enabling conditions and that the expenditure covered by the Union Funds meets the Union’s objectives. Since Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2020/2092 of the European Parliament and of the Council(6)is of horizontal application, the same requirement should apply to the amounts corresponding to commitments suspended by measures adopted on the basis of that Regulation. Amounts within the flexibility amount referred to in Article 86(1), second subparagraph, of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 and corresponding to the specific objectives subject to a negative assessment by the Commission on the basis of the application of the horizontal enabling conditions can be subject to a programme amendment or transfer on the basis of new priorities, provided that such new priorities comply with the objectives pursued by the horizontal enabling conditions.
(8) The ESF+ provides for support for investments contributing to the objectives of the Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (STEP), which was established by Regulation (EU) 2024/795 of the European Parliament and of the Council(7). STEP aims to strengthen the Union’s technological leadership and the development of skills in the Union. In order to provide further incentives for investments from the ESF+ in those critical fields, the possibility for Member States to receive higher pre-financing for related programme amendments should be extended. The priorities which support investments contributing to STEP objectives under a request for a programme amendment that was submitted to the Commission by 31 March 2025 are to receive the exceptional one-off pre-financing applicable at the time of the submission of that request.
(9) In order to enable Member States to carry out meaningful and just reprogramming, without diverging from the main objectives of the ESF+, and to focus resources on the strategic Union priorities referred to in this Regulation, without causing further delays in the implementation of programmes, it is appropriate to provide for further flexibility. The mid-term review serves as an opportunity to address emerging social aspects of strategic challenges and new priorities without prejudice to other Union legal acts or to the next multiannual financial framework. Member States should benefit from additional time to complete their assessment of the outcome of the mid-term review and their submission of related requests for programme amendments.
(10) Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine is having a disproportionately heavy impact on NUTS level 2 regions bordering Russia, Belarus or Ukraine, resulting in job losses, less economic activity and social exclusion. In order to accelerate the implementation of cohesion policy programmes and alleviate the pressure on national budgets as well as to inject the liquidity necessary for the implementation of key investments, an additional one-off pre-financing payment from the ESF+ should be paid for programmes. Because of the adverse impact of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, the pre-financing percentage should be further increased for certain programmes covering one or more NUTS level 2 regions bordering Russia, Belarus or Ukraine. In order to encourage re-programming towards key priorities in the context of the mid-term review, the additional one-off pre-financing should be available only where a certain threshold for the reallocation of financial resources to specific crucial priorities is reached.
(11) Furthermore, to take account of the time needed to refocus investments and to allow the best use of available resources, the deadlines for the eligibility of expenditure and the decommitment rules as well as other deadlines related to the performance framework, financial management, reporting and evaluation requirements should be adjusted for programmes carrying out a reallocation of resources to strategic priorities.
(12) It should be possible to apply a higher co-financing rate to priorities in programmes covering one or more NUTS level 2 regions bordering Russia, Belarus or Ukraine, given the adverse impact of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine on those NUTS level 2 regions.
(13) Skills development and the training of young talent as well as entrepreneurs are essential for job creation, and institutions working on skills creation and uptake, in particular vocational education and training institutes, should cooperate closely to align with labour market needs. In that context, Member States should also be able to allocate resources to attract young talent and entrepreneurs, particularly to rural and less developed regions, through incentives and targeted training.
(14) When amending programmes, the Member States should include, in relation to the dedicated priorities, with the close and meaningful participation of the social partners, obligations on the beneficiaries to respect working and employment conditions in accordance with the applicable Union and national law, conventions of the International Labour Organization and collective agreements.
(15) To support Member States in their swift and correct reprogramming, the Commission should provide timely and clear technical clarifications and support to managing authorities, including through a structured system, by answering technical, legal and procedural questions, in particular with regard to measures introduced by this Regulation.
(16) Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely to address the social aspects of strategic challenges, refocus investments on critical new priorities and simplify and accelerate policy delivery, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
(17) Regulation (EU) 2021/1057 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(18) Given the urgent need to enable crucial investments in skills in the defence industry as well as in adaptation to change linked to decarbonisation in the context of pressing strategic geopolitical challenges, this Regulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication in theOfficial Journal of the European Union,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

Article 1

Regulation (EU) 2021/1057 is amended as follows:
(1) the following article is inserted:‘Article 5aSpecific provisions linked to the mid-term review and related flexibility of the ESF+ strand under shared management1.   In 2026, the Commission shall pay 1,5 % of the total support from the ESF+ as additional one-off pre-financing, pursuant to the decision approving the programme amendment. That additional one-off pre-financing percentage in 2026 shall be increased to 9,5 % for programmes covering one or more NUTS level 2 regions bordering Russia, Belarus or Ukraine, provided that the programme does not cover the entire territory of the Member State concerned.

Done at Brussels, 18 September 2025.",https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202501913,"The European Commission has proposed amendments to the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+) regulation to better align it with the EU's strategic priorities, addressing challenges such as geopolitical shifts, the green transition, and technological advancements. This proposal, submitted to the European Parliament, aims to enhance the EU's economic resilience and strategic autonomy by allowing Member States to redirect resources towards new priorities, including defense capabilities, clean industrial deals, and skills development to tackle labor shortages. The mid-term review of the cohesion policy offers an opportunity to reassess and adjust the implementation of these funds to better respond to current challenges, emphasizing the need for greater flexibility and incentives to accelerate the deployment of resources.

The proposal highlights the importance of equipping Europe's workforce with the necessary skills to support the growing defense industry and the transition to a low-carbon economy. This includes skills in clean technologies, digitalization, and entrepreneurship. In response to geopolitical instability, the EU is considering a significant increase in support for defense capabilities, including a proposed EUR 800 billion response plan, REARM Europe, to bolster European defense capacities. The ESF+ will facilitate the development of skills in the defense industry by providing additional flexibilities, such as increased pre-financing and co-financing.

For Eastern border regions affected by the Russian aggression against Ukraine, the proposal suggests a one-off 9.5% pre-financing of program allocations in 2026 with 100% Union financing. This pre-financing is intended to be paid within 60 days","The European Parliament and the Council have adopted a regulation amending the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+), effective from September 18, 2025, to enhance its flexibility in addressing strategic challenges faced by the EU and its Member States. This amendment allows for more adaptable use of ESF+ resources to tackle geopolitical and economic challenges while maintaining core objectives like social inclusion, cohesion, and labor market activation. The regulation emphasizes balancing emergency responses with long-term social goals and encourages investment in social objectives alongside defense and cybersecurity. It supports worker and enterprise adaptation to decarbonization efforts, focusing on skill development and job creation, particularly in less developed regions and rural areas. The amendment also introduces measures to ensure effective use of funds by not allowing program amendments for objectives that fail to meet certain conditions, thereby incentivizing compliance with EU objectives. Additionally, it provides for increased pre-financing for investments aligned with the Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (STEP) and offers additional financial support to regions heavily impacted by Russia's aggression against Ukraine. This includes higher pre-financing percentages and co-financing rates for affected regions, along with adjusted deadlines for financial management and reporting to facilitate resource reallocation. The regulation also underscores the importance of skills development and training, particularly for young talent and entrepreneurs, to align with labor market needs and support job creation in rural and less developed areas. When amending programs, Member States are required to include obligations for beneficiaries to respect working and employment conditions, with the involvement of social partners. Furthermore"

7.3.2025  COM(2025) 106 final  2025/0058(COD)  Proposal for a  DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Council Directive 92/43/EEC as regards the protection status of the wolf (Canis lupus)  EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM  1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  On 6 December 2024, the Standing Committee of the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats (the Bern Convention) adopted the European Union’s proposal to change the protection status of the wolf ( Canis lupus ) by moving the species from Appendix II (strictly protected fauna species) to Appendix III (protected fauna species).  That decision entered into force three months later, in line with the procedure set out in Article 17 of the Bern Convention. Following its entry into force and in order to transpose this change under the Bern Convention, it is necessary to amend the annexes of Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora (the Habitats Directive) by moving reference to the species from Annex IV of the Directive to Annex V.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  The legal basis for this proposal is Article 192(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which sets out how the objectives referred to in Article 191 of the Treaty should be implemented.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  To transpose the changes under the Bern Convention into EU legislation, it is necessary to amend the Habitats Directive, which is one of the main instruments for implementing the international obligations of the EU under the Convention. This targeted amendment complies with the subsidiarity requirements.  • Proportionality  The proposed amendment relates solely to the effects of the decision of the Standing Committee of the Bern Convention to change the protection status of the wolf. Therefore, this proposal is strictly limited to the changes to the Habitats Directive that give effect to that decision at EU level. Specifically, it is a limited, targeted amendment to Annex IV and Annex V, solely concerning the wolf.  • Choice of the instrument  As the Habitats Directive transposes the Bern Convention’s provisions on the protection status of the wolf into EU law, it is appropriate to incorporate any changes to the protection of that species into the Habitats Directive through an amending Directive, via the ordinary legislative procedure.  3. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  The monitoring and reporting provisions of the Habitats Directive are not affected by this proposal.  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  Article 12 of the Habitats Directive sets out prohibitions concerning the deliberate capture or killing, deliberate disturbance, and deterioration or destruction of breeding sites or resting places. With this amendment, this strict protection would cease to apply to the wolf.  The wolf would then be subject to the protection set out in Article 14 of the Habitats Directive. Article 14 requires Member States to take measures to ensure that the taking in the wild of specimens of species of wild fauna and flora listed in Annex V as well as their exploitation is compatible with maintaining them at a favourable conservation status.  As with Article 12, Member States may derogate from the requirements of Article 14 provided they satisfy the requirements set out in Article 16 of the Directive.  Proposal for a  DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Council Directive 92/43/EEC as regards the protection status of the wolf ( Canis lupus )  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192(1) thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 1 ,  Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions 2 ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) For the reasons set out in Council Decision (EU) 2024/2669 3 , the Union submitted a proposal to the Standing Committee of the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats 4 (the Bern Convention) to lower the protection level of the wolf species under the Bern Convention . At its 44th meeting o n 6 December 2024, the Standing Committee approved the proposal of the Union to move the wolf ( Canis lupus ) from Appendix II ( ‘ S trictly protected fauna species’ ) to the Bern Convention to Appendix III ( ‘ P rotected fauna species’ ) to the Convention .  (2) In line with Article 17(3) of the Bern Convention, th e change to the protection status of the wolf entered into force on 7 March 2025, three months after the decision of the Standing Committee.  (3) Council Directive 92/43/EEC 5 is a key instrument for the conservation of nature in the Union, particularly in view of the Union’s international obligations under the Bern Convention. For the change to the protection status of the wolf to be transposed into the legal framework of the Union , t he decision of the Standing Committee should be reflected in Directive 92/43/EEC.  (4) Transposing the decision of the Standing Committee requires moving reference to the wolf from Annex IV to Directive 92/43/EEC to Annex V to that Directive, which makes the wolf subject to the protection provided for in Article 14 of Directive 92/43/EEC .  (5) Directive 92/43/EEC aims to contribute to ensuring biodiversity through the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora in the European territory of the Member States to which the Treaty applies.  (6) Directive 92/43/EEC is an instrument in the field of environment, which permits Member States to maintain or introduce more stringent protective measures as long as they are compatible with the Treaties, as provided for in Article 193 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Therefore, for the purposes of Directive 92/43/EEC, Member States remain free to maintain a strict level of protection for the wolf.  (7) Directive 92/43/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly,  HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:  Article 1  Directive 92/43/EEC is amended as follows:  in Annex IV, the following paragraph is deleted:  ‘ Canis lupus (except the Greek populations north of the 39th parallel; Estonian populations, Spanish populations north of the Duero; Bulgarian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Polish, Slovak populations and Finnish populations within the reindeer management area as defined in paragraph 2 of the Finnish Act No 848/90 of 14 September 1990 on reindeer management)’;  in Annex V, the following paragraph:  ‘ Canis lupus (Spanish populations north of the Duero, Greek populations north of the 39th parallel, Finnish populations within the reindeer management area as defined in paragraph 2 of the Finnish Act No 848/90 of 14 September 1990 on reindeer management, Bulgarian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Estonian, Polish and Slovak populations)’  is replaced with the following:  ‘ Canis lupus ’.  Article 2  1. Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by […] [OP please insert date = 18 months after date of entry into force of th is Directive] . They shall forthwith communicate to the Commission the text of those provisions.  When Member States adopt those provisions, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or be accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication. Member States shall determine how such reference is to be made.  2. Member States shall communicate to the Commission the text of the main provisions of national law that they adopt in the field covered by this Directive.  Article 3  This Directive shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union .  Article 4  This Directive is addressed to the Member States.

(As an agreement was reached between Parliament and Council, Parliament's position corresponds to the final legislative act, Directive (EU) 2025/1237.)",,,,,,,,"DIRECTIVE (EU) 2025/1237 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL
of 17 June 2025
amending Council Directive 92/43/EEC as regards the protection status of the wolf (Canis lupus)
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192(1) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee(1),
After consulting the Committee of the Regions,
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure(2),
Whereas:
(1) For the reasons set out in Council Decision (EU) 2024/2669(3), the Union submitted a proposal to the Standing Committee of the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats(4)(the ‘Bern Convention’) to change the protection status of the wolf species under that Convention. At its 44th meeting on 6 December 2024, the Standing Committee approved the proposal of the Union to move the wolf (Canis lupus) from Appendix II (‘Strictly protected fauna species’) to the Bern Convention to Appendix III (‘Protected fauna species’) to that Convention (‘the decision of the Standing Committee’).
(2) In accordance with Article 17(3) of the Bern Convention, the change to the protection status of the wolf entered into force on 7 March 2025.
(3) Council Directive 92/43/EEC(5)is a key instrument for the conservation of nature in the Union, particularly in view of the Union’s international obligations under the Bern Convention. For the change to the protection status of the wolf under the Bern Convention to be transposed into the legal framework of the Union, the decision of the Standing Committee should be reflected in Directive 92/43/EEC.
(4) In order to transpose the decision of the Standing Committee, the entry for the wolf should be deleted from Annex IV to Directive 92/43/EEC and adjusted in Annex V to that Directive, thereby providing the wolf with the protection provided for in Article 14 of Directive 92/43/EEC.
(5) Directive 92/43/EEC aims to contribute to ensuring biodiversity through the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora in the European territory of the Member States to which the Treaty applies.
(6) Directive 92/43/EEC, as an instrument in the field of the environment, permits Member States to maintain or introduce more stringent protective measures as long as they are compatible with the Treaties, as provided for in Article 193 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Therefore, for the purposes of Directive 92/43/EEC, Member States remain free, notwithstanding the amendment introduced by this Directive, to maintain the protection status of the wolf at the level of protection provided to strictly protected fauna species.
(7) Since the objective of this Directive can only be achieved at Union level, because it requires amending an existing Union legal act, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.
(8) Directive 92/43/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:

Article 1

Directive 92/43/EEC is amended as follows:
(1) in Annex IV, point (a), ‘Animals’, the entry for the speciesCanis lupusis deleted;
(2) in Annex V, point (a), ‘Animals’, the entry for the speciesCanis lupusis replaced by the following:‘Canis lupus’.

Article 2

1.   Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 15 January 2027. They shall immediately inform the Commission thereof.
When Member States adopt those measures, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or shall be accompanied by such reference on the occasion of their official publication. The methods of making such reference shall be laid down by Member States.
2.   Member States shall communicate to the Commission the text of the main measures of national law which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive.

Article 3

This Directive shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in theOfficial Journal of the European Union.

Article 4

This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
Done at Strasbourg, 17 June 2025.",https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202501237,"The European Commission has proposed an amendment to the Habitats Directive to align with a recent decision by the Standing Committee of the Bern Convention, which oversees wildlife conservation in Europe. This decision has reclassified the protection status of the wolf (Canis lupus) from ""strictly protected"" to ""protected."" As a result, the EU must update its legislation, moving the wolf from Annex IV, which lists species requiring strict protection, to Annex V, where species are protected but can be subject to certain conditions. This change means that while the wolf remains protected, the strict prohibitions against its capture, killing, and disturbance will be relaxed. Instead, the wolf will be subject to regulations ensuring its conservation status remains favorable, allowing for some controlled activities under specific conditions.

The proposal reflects the EU's commitment to fulfilling its international obligations under the Bern Convention and involves consultation with national parliaments and various EU bodies. Member States are allowed to maintain or introduce more stringent protective measures for the wolf if they are compatible with EU treaties. The directive will come into effect 20 days after its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union, with Member States required to implement necessary laws and regulations within 18 months. This legislative change aims to contribute to biodiversity conservation by adjusting the legal framework governing the protection of the wolf in Europe.

Regarding the budget, the proposal does not anticipate any financial impact. There is no provision for co-financing by third parties, and the proposal has no financial impact on revenue. Additionally","The European Parliament and the Council of the European Union have adopted a directive amending the protection status of the wolf (Canis lupus) under European Union law. This change reflects a decision made by the Standing Committee of the Bern Convention, which moved the wolf from a category of strictly protected species to a category of protected species. As a result, the wolf is no longer listed under Annex IV of the EU's Habitats Directive, which previously provided it with stricter protection. However, the directive allows individual EU member states to maintain or introduce more stringent protective measures for wolves if they choose. Member states are required to implement the necessary laws and regulations to align with this directive by January 15, 2027. This directive aims to harmonize the EU's legal framework with its international obligations under the Bern Convention, while still allowing flexibility for member states to decide on their level of protection for wolves."

26.2.2025  COM(2025) 87 final  2025/0039(COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulation (EU) 2023/956 as regards simplifying and strengthening the carbon border adjustment mechanism  (Text with EEA relevance)  {SWD(2025) 58 final}  EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM  1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  In his report on ‘The Future of European Competitiveness’, Mario Draghi emphasised the need for Europe to create a regulatory landscape which facilitates competitiveness and resilience 1 . In the Budapest Declaration on the New European Competitiveness Deal, EU Heads of State and Government called for ‘a simplification revolution, ensuring a clear, simple and smart regulatory framework for businesses and drastically reducing administrative, regulatory and reporting burdens, in particular for SMEs’ 2 . Multiple companies and stakeholders have voiced their concerns about the administrative burden resulting from a number of EU acts, including Regulation (EU) 2023/956 establishing a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (‘CBAM Regulation’) 3 .  In its Communication on the Competitive Compass for the EU, the Commission confirmed that it would deliver an unprecedented simplification effort to achieve the agreed policy objectives in the simplest, most targeted, most effective and least burdensome way. In its Communication entitled ‘A simpler and faster Europe: Communication on implementation and simplification’, the Commission set out an implementation and simplification agenda that delivers fast and visible improvements for people and business on the ground, requiring more than an incremental approach and underlining the need for bold action to streamline and simplify EU, national and regional rules 4 .  Administrative requirements, including reporting requirements, play a key role in ensuring correct enforcement and proper monitoring of legislation. Generally, their costs are largely offset by the benefits they bring. However, reporting requirements can also impose disproportionate burdens on stakeholders, particularly affecting small and medium-sized enterprises and micro-companies.  This proposal will deliver simplifications and cost-efficient improvements to the CBAM Regulation without affecting the achievement of objectives in this policy area. The proposed measures will not undermine the environmental objective of CBAM, rather the measures will enable a more efficient CBAM while the key design principles of the mechanism will remain unchanged.  The proposal will make it easier for importers of goods into the Union to comply with CBAM reporting obligations by simplifying some of those CBAM reporting requirements which rely on complex calculations and data collection processes which would hamper the CBAM’s effective implementation.  In addition, the proposal will strengthen the monitoring and supervision of CBAM. It will increase the ability of the Commission to process data and exchange relevant information with national authorities to ensure that the utility of the information reported by stakeholders is maximised. It will also enable the Commission to better detect risks and the national competent authorities to be better equipped to take appropriate actions where needed  Finally, simplifying the mechanism will also be a key enabler for a potential future scope extension. In the second half of 2025, the Commission will present a comprehensive CBAM review report as provided in Article 30 of the CBAM regulation, which will pave the way for a potential extension of the CBAM scope.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  This proposal is part of a package of measures aiming at simplifying reporting requirements, by looking comprehensively at existing requirements, with a view to assess their continued relevance and to make them more efficient. It builds on existing rules from the CBAM Regulation, Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/1773 of 17 August 2023 laying down the reporting obligations for the transitional period 5 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2024/3210 of 18 December 2024 laying down rules for the CBAM registry 6 .  • Consistency with other Union policies  The proposal is consistent with the objectives of the better regulation agenda, as it will strengthen the Commission’s ability to carry out its general supervision of CBAM, while avoiding the costs (both for the Commission and the entities providing the information) that would otherwise be incurred in collecting the information through other means.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  The proposal amends an existing regulation. Therefore, the legal basis for the proposal is the same as the legal basis of the amended Regulation, namely Article 192(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (‘TFEU’) in the area of environment protection.  In accordance with Articles 191 and 192(1) of TFEU, the Union shall contribute to the pursuit, inter alia, of the following objectives: preserving, protecting and improving the quality of the environment, promoting measures at international level to deal with regional or worldwide environmental problems, and in particular combating climate change.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  The CBAM Regulation created a common uniform framework ensuring an equivalence between the carbon pricing policy applied in the EU’s internal market and the carbon pricing policy applied on imports.  The simplifications to that regulation envisaged by this proposal will further enhance legal certainty and rationalise the reporting requirements.  • Proportionality  The simplification of administrative requirements, including reporting requirements, simplifies the legal framework by introducing changes to existing requirements that do not affect the substance of the policy objectives. The proposal is therefore limited to those changes that are necessary to decrease the compliance burden and to ensure compliance in a more efficient manner without changing the substance of the legislation concerned.  The proposal is consistent with the principle of proportionality as it does not go beyond what is necessary to meet the objectives of the Treaties. The proportionality of the proposal has a number of important aspects.  Firstly, it is recognised that it is challenging for importers to deal with the CBAM reporting requirements while at the same time Member States’ competent authorities must carry out important supervision tasks. This will be mitigated by introducing a threshold to exempt from CBAM obligations certain importers.  Secondly, for importers within the CBAM scope, the proposal contains changes to the reporting requirements, targeting those which are necessary to decrease the compliance burden and ensure compliance in a more efficient manner.  • Choice of the instrument  The proposal requires amending the CBAM Regulation. It lays down the specific rules necessary for the simplified application of certain provisions of the CBAM Regulation, where the goals pursued cannot be reached through the adoption of implementing measures as they require amending basic provisions of the CBAM Regulation. This concerns the de minimis derogation, the reporting obligations, the calculation of embedded emissions and the calculation of the financial adjustment.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  The proposal relies on the experience gained in implementing the CBAM Regulation since the mechanism started to apply in its transitional phase on 1 October 2023.  • Stakeholder consultations  Since the CBAM started to apply in its transitional phase on 1 October 2023, the Commission Services have continuously been consulting stakeholders in the Union and in third countries relevant for CBAM via multiple communication channels. In 2023, the Commission Services renewed the mandate of the expert group on CBAM 7 whose mission is to assist the Commission services in the development and implementation of the CBAM, harness technical expertise and bring exchanges of experience and good practices in CBAM implementation.  In 2023, the Commission Services also launched a broad communication campaign to raise awareness about CBAM including in third countries , explain the rules and provide useful advice in how CBAM could be implemented by the relevant stakeholders (such as importers, third country producers, national authorities). This communication campaign relied on publicly available live webinars in several EU languages. Useful materials have been provided on the CBAM-dedicated webpage 8 : targeted e-learning materials, Q&A, guidance (also translated to non-EU official languages).  The Commission was also in regular contact with national competent authorities for CBAM, to discuss various issues concerning implementation of CBAM, with a view to improve its functioning and effectiveness.  On 6 February 2025, the Commission hosted a high-level consultation day with key stakeholders to test the main ideas of the legislative package on simplification on targeted policies, including the CBAM, and to collect input and feedback ahead of its adoption on 26 February 2025.  Based on these actions and repeated public meetings with relevant business representatives from the Union and third countries, the Commission Services have collected sufficient feedback from stakeholders to adopt the best measures to achieve the objective of the proposal: simplify the complex reporting rules to reduce the compliance burden and ensure CBAM is efficiently rolled out while preserving its environmental objective and climate objective.  • Collection and use of expertise  The proposal has been elaborated following a process of internal scrutiny of existing reporting obligations and is based on experience in implementing the related legislation, including the data collected through the quarterly CBAM report submitted by declarants. Since this is a step in the process of continuous assessment of reporting requirements in Union legislations, the scrutiny of such burdens and of their impact on stakeholders will continue in the future.  • Impact assessment  The proposal concerns targeted changes of the CBAM Regulation to simplify some of its requirements, including reporting. The main measures are based on experience in implementing this Regulation and abovementioned related implementing acts. The proposed targeted changes ensure a more efficient and effective implementation of the existing mechanism.  This proposal is accompanied by an analytical document , the Commission Staff Working Document (SWD) “Towards a simpler and more effective Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism” 9 . The analytical document builds on and further complements the analysis carried out in the original impact assessment conducted in 2021.  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  In the 2021 impact assessment accompanying the CBAM legislative proposal 10 , the Commission concluded that, since CBAM is initially applied to imports of selected basic materials and their products, large businesses would be the primary ones affected, but that in practice the CBAM would result in relatively higher compliance costs for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) compared to large enterprises in scope of CBAM, e.g. those importing CBAM goods above the derogation .  Based on the experience in implementing CBAM in its transitional phase, and on the assessment of stakeholders’ feedback since 1 October 2023, it has become clear that CBAM requires two types of main simplifications: a broader derogation from CBAM requirements of importers of very small quantities of CBAM goods, and a set of simplifications for the rest of the importers of CBAM goods to facilitate their compliance with the administrative requirements.  The proposed simplification is expected to exempt around 90% of importers from CBAM obligations, while maintaining more than 99% of embedded emissions in scope of CBAM, thereby safeguarding the environmental nature of the mechanism.  • Fundamental rights  The proposal respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the Union. In particular, it contributes to the objective of a high level of environmental protection in accordance with the principle of sustainable development as laid down in Article 37 of the Charter.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  This proposal will have implications for the EU budget. Its impact is assessed in the legislative financial and digital statement accompanying this proposal.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  As the proposal amends the CBAM Regulation, it does not have additional implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements beyond the existing ones under the said Regulation.  It is however important to recall that the Commission will continue ensuring that arrangements are in place to monitor and evaluate the functioning of the CBAM, including its enforcement against circumvention practices, and evaluate it against the main policy objectives. Given that the CBAM is one of the policy proposals under the ‘Fit for 55 Package’ adopted by the Commission in July 2021 11 , monitoring and evaluation will be carried out in alignment with the other policies of the package.  The Commission will monitor how CBAM is implemented to feed into its analysis and will regularly report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the application of the CBAM Regulation. As part of that reporting, the Commission will propose possible changes to improve its functioning, collect the necessary information for a potential further extension of the scope of CBAM, including on other goods that could be at risk of carbon leakage, such as downstream products. Those reports should also contain an assessment of the impact of the CBAM on carbon leakage, including in relation to exports, and its economic, environmental, social and territorial impact throughout the Union.  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  The proposal contains two types of simplifications.  First, importers of small quantities of CBAM goods, which represent very small quantities of embedded emissions imported into the Union and in most cases correspond to SMEs and individuals, will be exempt from CBAM obligations. For those importers, the administrative burden resulting from compliance with CBAM obligations significantly outweighs the environmental and regulatory benefit. This is due to the combination of (i) the insignificant share of embedded emissions in all their CBAM goods imported into the Union and (ii) the inability of national authorities to enforce the rules due to the large numbers of importers of small quantities of CBAM goods.  Second, the proposal contains a set of simplifications for importers of CBAM goods above the threshold to facilitate their compliance with the reporting requirements. In particular, the proposal simplifies and streamlines the authorisation procedure for national competent authorities and the Commission, the data collection processes from third country producers to authorised CBAM declarants, the calculation of embedded emissions for certain goods, the emission verification rules, the calculation of the authorised CBAM declarants’ financial liability during the year of imports into the EU and the claim by authorised CBAM declarants for carbon prices paid in third countries where goods are produced.  Article 1(1) amends the derogation from the CBAM obligations by introducing a new mass threshold as laid out in a new Annex VII to the CBAM Regulation, to exclude importers of very small quantities of goods.  Article 1(2) amends the definitions of importer and operator to facilitate reporting requirements.  Articles 1(3) and 1(4), point (b), draw the consequences of the new threshold on the rules related to the authorisation that importers must be granted to import goods above that threshold, and provide for the possibility for authorised CBAM declarants, which remain legally responsible of their CBAM obligations, to technically delegate in the CBAM Registry the reporting requirements to third parties to facilitate compliance.  Articles 1(4)(a) changes the annual deadline for submitting the annual CBAM declaration.  Article 1(4)(c) introduces the possibility for authorised CBAM declarants to claim a carbon price paid in a third country other than the country of origin.  Articles 1(4), point (d), and 1(6) amend the rules on emission verification so that the obligation to verify embedded emissions only applies to actual values.  Article 1(5) amends the calculation of embedded emissions in the case of relevant input materials (precursors).  Article 1(7) introduces the possibility for authorised CBAM declarants to use default carbon prices calculated and made available by the Commission and claim carbon prices paid in third countries other than the country of origin of the goods.  Article 1(8) facilitates reporting obligations by introducing several changes to the portal established pursuant to Article 10 to register operators and installations in third countries.  Article 1(9) creates the registration of accredited verifiers so they can access the CBAM registry and carry out certain relevant tasks to facilitate reporting obligations.  Article 1(10) strengthens the empowerment Member States give to their national competent authority to carry out the CBAM-related duties and responsibilities.  Articles 1(11) and 1(13) draw the consequences of the changes introduced by this proposal on the requirements applying on the CBAM registry, risk analysis and monitoring.  Article 1(12) streamlines the consultation of other competent authorities and the Commission to reduce excessive administrative burden.  Article 1(14) sets the start date of the sales of CBAM certificates to February 2027 to address significant uncertainties related to the year 2026, which is the first year of the post-transitional period, and streamlines the information exchanges between the CBAM registry and the common central platform.  Articles 1(15) and 1(18) draw the consequences of the move of certificate sales to 2027 on the determination of the financial adjustment for the year 2026.  Article 1(16) simplifies the calculation as from 2027 by authorised CBAM declarants of their expected financial liability during the year of imports.  Article 1(17) modifies the repurchase limit to facilitate the way authorised CBAM declarant may manage their CBAM financial liability and draws the consequence of the change of the CBAM declaration submission annual deadline.  Articles 1(19) modifies the scope of information exchanged with customs authorities, the competent authorities and the Commission to reflect the introduction of the derogation.  Articles 1(20) and 1(22) introduce the rules and information exchanges on the monitoring of the derogation.  Article 1(21) introduces the possibility for competent authorities to modulate the penalty based on relevant facts and circumstances and draws the consequences of the new derogation.  Article 1(23) amends the empowerments given to the Commission by the co-legislators to adopt delegated acts in light of the simplifications made by this proposal.  Article 1(24) complements the reporting by the Commission to the co-legislators with the application of the derogation as amended by this proposal.  Article 1(25) amends the list of CBAM goods to exclude non-calcined kaolinic clays.  Article 1(26) adds electricity to the list of CBAM goods for which only direct emissions are to be taken into account in the calculation of the embedded emissions.  Article 1(27) amends Annex IV to Regulation (EU) 2023/956 to exclude input materials which have been subject to the EU ETS or to a carbon pricing system that is fully linked with the EU ETS.  Article 1(28) introduces a new Annex VII to set the threshold referred to in Article 1(1) point (b).  Finally, the Annexes contain several simplifications of embedded emission calculation to facilitate reporting obligations, for instance in the case of default values or precursors produced in the EU.  2025/0039 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulation (EU) 2023/956 as regards simplifying and strengthening the carbon border adjustment mechanism  (Text with EEA relevance)  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192(1) thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 12 ,  Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions 13 ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) During the transitional period , which started on 1 October 2023, the Commission has been collecting data and information on the implementation of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (‘CBAM’) as provided for in Regulation (EU) 2023/956 of the European Parliament and of the Council 14 , including through the analysis of quarterly reports submitted by reporting declarants. The information collected and the exchanges with the stakeholders, including as part of the expert group on the CBAM, have outlined possibilities for simplification s and improvement of the CBAM. The Union is committed to ensure a smooth roll-out of the CBAM during the post-transitional period starting on 1 January 2026 .  (2) Based on the experience acquired and data collected during the transitional period, t he distribution of importers of CBAM goods into the Union shows that only a small proportion of importers accounts for the vast majority of embedded emissions in those goods . The derogation applied to the importation of goods of negligible value referred to in Article 23 of Regulation (EC) No 1186/2009 (consignments of a value below EUR 150) appears insufficient to ensure that the CBAM applies to importers in proportion to their impact on emissions covered by Regulation (EU) 2023/956. For th o se importers of small quantities of goods, compliance with CBAM reporting and financial obligations could be unduly burdensome . Furthermore, as part of the 2023 Customs reform package, the Commission proposed to remove this derogation 15 . Therefore, a n ew derogation should be introduced to exempt importers of small quantities in terms of mass of CBAM goods from CBAM obligations, while preserving the environmental objective of th a t mechanism and its capacity to achieve its climate objective .  (3) A new threshold based on cumulative mass per importer per year should be introduced in Regulation (EU) 2023/956, ensuring that more than 99% of emissions are maintained in scope. This is a robust and targeted approach as it accurately reflects the environmental nature of the CBAM by taking into account all imported emissions over a period of time in determining the threshold. It also eliminates the risk of circumvention through the artificial splitting of consignments by a single importer.  (4) A mass-based threshold reflecting the average emissions intensity of the volume of imported CBAM goods would better translate the climate objective of the CBAM. A single mass-based threshold applying cumulatively to all CBAM goods in the iron and steel, aluminium, fertilisers and cement sectors imported by importers during a calendar year is the simplest design for importers, as they will not have to obtain or provide any data additional to those provided in the customs declaration, thereby reducing substantially any CBAM-related administrative burden for these importers. A threshold set at a level of 50 tonnes will exempt the vast majority of importers from obligations under Regulation (EU) 2023/956 while maintaining more than 99% of embedded emissions in the scope of the CBAM . To establish the threshold, a new Annex VII should be introduced.  (5) The main principles governing the threshold, including ensuring that nearly all embedded emissions remain in the scope of the CBAM, should be laid down in Regulation (EU) 2023/956 to provide legal certainty. Regulation (EU) 2023/956 should also provide for the possibility to re-c alculate the threshold on the basis of updated average emission intensities of imported goods or significant changes in trade patterns or practices of circumvention affecting the coverage of embedded emissions in the scope of the CBAM .  (6) To ensure that the derogation is sufficiently targeted, it should apply to the importer. The indirect customs representative, due to the nature of its activity and the related obligations under Regulation (EU) 2023/956, should always be required to obtain an authorisation .  (7) The competent authorities and the Commission should – based on customs information – monitor the quantities of goods imported to assess compliance with the threshold. To allow the competent authorities to make an informed decision, the customs authorities and the Commission should make the necessary information and data available to the competent authorities. Where the competent authority concludes that an importer has exceeded the threshold, it should communicate that information to the customs authorities who , in turn, should not allow further importation of goods from that importer until the end of the calendar year , or until th at importer has obtained the status of authorised CBAM declarant .  (8) Where an importer expects to exceed the annual threshold or intends to import goods after exceeding the threshold, the importer should apply for authorisation pursuant to Article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2023/956. For importers who have not been granted the authorisation before exceeding the threshold, penalties should apply for the entirety of the imported goods in accordance with Article 26(2) of Regulation (EU) 2023/956. The payment of the penalty in accordance with Article 26(2) of that Regulation should release the importer from the obligation to submit a CBAM declaration and to surrender CBAM certificates .  (9) T o ensure that the definition of an importer covers all relevant customs procedures, it is necessary to amend it to include the case of the simplified customs procedure where only a bill of discharge is submitted pursuant to Article 175(5) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/2446 16 .  (10) T o strike a balance between the effectiveness of the authorisation procedure and the risk profile of the applicants, the consultation procedure should be optional for the competent authority. The consultation procedure should allow the competent authority to consult other competent authorities and the Commission when considered necessary based on the information submitted by the applicant and customs information made available in the CBAM registry .  (11) To provide additional flexibility, the authorised CBAM declarant s should be able to delegate the submission of the CBAM declaration to a third party. The authorised CBAM declarant should remain liable for the submission of the CBAM declaration . To provide the required delegation and access, th at third party should fulfil certain technical credentials, including holding an Economic Operators Registration and Identification (EORI) number and being established in a Member State .  (12) Authorised CBAM declarants are required to submit their annual CBAM declaration and surrender the corresponding number of certificates by 31 May of the year following the year of import. In order to provide authorised CBAM declarants flexibility to comply with their oblig ations , a later date of submission would provide authorised CBAM declarants more time to collect the necessary information, ensure that embedded emissions are verified by an accredited verifier, and purchase the corresponding number of CBAM certificates . The date for the cancellation of CBAM certificates should be adjusted accordingly.  (13) The embedded emissions of some aluminium and steel goods currently included in the scope of CBAM are primarily determined by the embedded emissions of input materials (precursors), while the emissions arising during the production steps of th o se goods are typically relatively low. They consist of finishing processes that are carried out by separate installations not covered by the EU e missions t rading s ystem ( ‘EU ETS ’ ) as provided for in Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 17 , except for the case of integrated facilities. The embedded emissions of those production processes should be excluded from the system boundaries of the calculation of emissions .  (14) Where input materials (precursors) have already been subject to the EU ETS or to a carbon pricing system that is fully linked with the EU ETS , the embedded emissions of th o se precursors should not be accounted for in the calculation of the embedded emissions of complex goods .  (15) Authorised CBAM declarants are required to submit an annual CBAM declaration containing the calculation of embedded emissions on the basis of either default values or actual values verified by accredited verifiers . Default values will be calculated and made available by the Commission. Therefore, the verification of embedded emissions should only apply to actual values .  (16) Information collected during the transitional period illustrates difficulties for reporting declarants to obtain the required information on the carbon price effectively paid in a third country. To facilitate the deduction of the carbon price, the Commission should, where possible, establish an annual average carbon price expressed in EUR/tCO 2 e of the effective carbon price paid, based on the best available data from reliable, publicly available information and information provided by third countries , including on a conservative basis .  (17) Authorised CBAM declarants may claim a reduction in the number of CBAM certificates to be surrendered corresponding to the carbon price effectively paid in the country of origin for the declared embedded emissions. Since the carbon price may be paid in a third country other than the country of origin of the imported goods, such carbon price should also be eligible for deduction .  (18) To improve the reliability of the emissions data contained in the CBAM registry and to facilitate the submission of data, accredited verifiers should be allowed to access the CBAM registry to verify the embedded emissions upon request from an operator in third countrie s . In addition, parent companies or related undertakings of th ose operator s should be allowed to access the CBAM registry for the purpose of registering and sharing relevant data on be half of the controlled operator . The o perators should be required to provide a corporate or activity registration number to ensure their identification .  (19) To foster the implementation of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 at national level, Member States should ensure that the competent authorities have the necessary powers to perform their duties .  (20) To provide authorised CBAM declarants sufficient time to prepare for compliance with the amended obligations under Regulation (EU) 2023/956, Member States should start selling CBAM certificates in 2027 for emissions embedded in goods imported during the year 2026. The price of CBAM certificates , purchased in 2027 and corresponding to emissions embedded in goods imported into the EU in 2026 , should reflect the prices of EU ETS allowances in 2026 .  (21) The obligation for the authorised CBAM declarant s to ensure that the number of CBAM certificates on their account in the CBAM registry at the end of each quarter corresponds to at least 80 % of the emissions embedded in the goods they have imported since the start of the year , is insufficiently tailored to the expected financial adjustment. It is therefore necessary to both reduce the ratio from 80 % to 50 % and integrate the free allocation of EU ETS allowances. Furthermore, the authorised CBAM declarant should be able to rely on the information submitted in the CBAM declaration in the previous year, for the same goods and third countr ies .  (22) The repurchase limit should likewise align more accurately with the number of CBAM certificates which the authorised CBAM declarants are required to purchase during the year of imports .  (23) Since CBAM certificate s are cancelled without any compensation , there is no need for an exchange of information from the common central platform to the CBAM registry at the end of the working day.  (24) The competent authorities, when applying penalties, should be able to take into account the specific circumstances such as the intentional or negligent behaviour of the declarant. Th at would allow for a reduction of the amount of the penalty where minor or unintentional errors are made .  (25) The CBAM applies to certain carbon-intensive goods imported into the U nion . The list of CBAM goods in Annex I of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 includes ‘ [o] ther kaolinic clays’ in the list of cement goods. While calcined kaolinic clays are carbon-intensive products, this is not the case for non-calcined kaolinic clays. Non-calcined kaolinic clays should therefore be excluded from the scope of the CBAM .  (26) Annex II to Regulation (EU) 2023/956 lists the goods for which only direct emissions should be taken into account in the calculation of embedded emissions. For goods not listed in that Annex, both direct and indirect emissions should be taken into account. Since indirect emissions are not relevant in the case of electricity generation, electricity should be added to the list of goods in that Annex .  (27) It is also necessary to simplify the means for determining default values when reliable data for the exporting country would not be available for a certain type of goods. In such cases, to prevent carbon leakage, the default value should be set at the level of the average emission intensity of the ten exporting countries with the highest emission intensities for which reliable data is available , which is an appropriate average to ensure the environmental objective of the CBAM . This is without prejudice to the possibility to adapt these default values based on region-specific features pursuant to point 7 of Annex IV of the CBAM.  (28) In order to amend certain non-essential elements of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 , the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of amending the threshold in Annex VII to that Regulation, where necessary, as determined in accordance with Article 2(3a) of that Regulation . It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making*. In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States' experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.  * Interinstitutional Agreement between the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission on Better Law-Making, Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making, (OJ L 123, 12.5.2016, p. 1–14, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/agree_interinstit/2016/512/oj ) .  (29) Since the objectives of this Regulation cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States , namely simplifying certain obligations and strengthening the mechanism that the Union has adopted to prevent the risk of carbon leakage and thereby reduce global carbon emissions but can rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.

FRAMEWORK OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE  1.1. Title of the proposal/initiative  Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism  1.2. Policy area(s) concerned  Climate policy  1.3. Objective(s)  1.3.1. General objective(s)  In light of the EU’s increased climate ambitions, the introduction of a CBAM has the overarching objective of addressing climate change by reducing GHG emissions in the EU and globally.  The amending proposal aims at simplifying the compliance burden on importers of CBAM goods.  1.3.2. Specific objective(s)  The overarching objective of addressing climate change is further articulated in a number of specific objectives, namely: (i) Addressing the risk of carbon leakage under increased EU ambition. (ii) Contributing to the provision of a stable and secure policy framework for investments in low or zero carbon technologies. (iii) Ensuring that domestic production and imports are subject to similar level of carbon pricing. (iv) Encouraging producers in third countries who export to the EU to adopt low carbon technologies. (v) Ensuring that the measure is effective, minimising the risk of being circumvented, thus providing environmental integrity. (vi) Ensuring a proportionate administrative burden for businesses and public authorities in the application of the measure.  The amending proposal aims at: (i) reducing administrative burden; (ii) improving the functioning of CBAM.  1.3.3. Expected result(s) and impact  Specify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.  The introduction of a CBAM envisages a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions both in the EU-27 and in the rest of the world in the sectors covered by CBAM. The CBAM is also expected to reduce the risks of carbon leakage, therefore gradually replacing the free allocation of allowances under the EU ETS.  As regards economic impacts, the modelling conducted before the adoption of the CBAM Regulation indicated that the introduction of a CBAM and other measures needed to reach the EU’s increased climate ambitions could lead to a GDP contraction for the EU 27 by 0.22 % to 0.23 % in 2030. Impact on the investment side is modest. On the consumption side CBAM appears to have a slightly stronger negative effect relative to the scenario of increased climate ambition and no CBAM.  By effectively reducing carbon leakage, the introduction of a CBAM leads to a reduction in imports in the EU 27. Overall, the social impacts of CBAM are limited.  Administrative impacts on the Commission, businesses national authorities, are expected. Altogether, compliance costs for businesses and authorities, while significant, are expected to be proportionate, and manageable in light of the environmental benefits of the measure. While revenue generation is not an objective of CBAM is expected to generate additional revenue, which for 2030 is estimated at above EUR [2.1 billion to be updated].  The amending proposal expects to:  (i) reduce the number of entities subject to CBAM obligations while preserving the environmental integrity of the mechanism and its capacity to achieve its climate objective;  (ii) enhance the functioning of the mechanism by simplifying and streamlining processes and procedures. The proposal will make it easier for importers of goods into the Union to comply with CBAM reporting obligations by simplifying some of those CBAM reporting requirements which relate to complex calculations or rely on hazardous data collection processes which hamper effective CBAM implementation.  In addition, the proposal will also strengthen the monitoring and supervision of CBAM. It will increase the ability of the Commission to process data and exchange relevant information with national authorities to ensure that the utility of the information reported by stakeholders is maximised. It will also enable both the Commission to better detect risks and national authorities to be better equipped to take appropriate actions where needed.  1.3.4. Indicators of performance  Specify the indicators for monitoring progress and achievements.  Exempt from CBAM obligations importers of small quantities of CBAM goods  Optimisation of processes to increase effectiveness and reduce administrative burden  1.4. The proposal/initiative relates to:   a new action   a new action following a pilot project / preparatory action 18   the extension of an existing action   a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action  1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative  1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative  The CBAM was introduced from October 2023. A simplified system of the CBAM scheme is currently in place until the end of 2025. Specifically, a transitional period (dry-run for data collection) currently applies to facilitate the smooth roll out of the CBAM and allow traders and importers to adjust.  Commission services are in charge of implementing and enforcing CBAM both during the transition period (2023-2025) and will also be during the definitive phase (from 2026).  During the transition period this implies collecting information from importers of CBAM goods in the EU on the embedded GHG emissions of these goods and analysing data.  The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) calls for a progressive introduction of the different functions necessary for its effective implementation. Firstly, a number of reports and reviews need to be prepared in order to facilitate the financial obligation to be set in place. Recognizing this, the CBAM regulation foresees its implementation in two consecutive periods: the Transitional Period from October 2023 until end of 2025 and the Definitive Period as from early 2026.  During the Transitional Period the obligation placed on importers and the EU Authorities (customs) is limited to the filing of the quarterly CBAM reports in addition of the Import declarations.  During the transitional period, transitional information management system (CBAM Transitional Period – CBAM TP) were put in place to support the submission and collection of quarterly reports, as well as the assimilation of data from each report into an aggregated database, to allow for their effective analysis for the purposes of reporting in line with the provisions of the Regulation.  Additionally, during the transitional period, customs authorities are tasked with informing customs declarants of the obligation to report information, so as to contribute to the gathering of information as well as to the awareness on the need to request the status of authorised declarant when applicable (before the first importation of CBAM goods from 1 January 2026).  The Definitive Period is planned to start on the 01.01.26 for the core CBAM declaration and certificates management services as listed here and one year earlier for authorised declarants registration and processing of CBAM authorisations by the competent authorities:  - importers are only entitled to import these goods after they have been granted an authorisation (except in case of the derogation proposed in the amending Regulation) by competent authorities, or if they would appoint a representative authorised as CBAM declarant. Customs authorities should not allow the importation of CBAM goods without a authorised CBAM declarant being involved. Furthermore, the customs authorities may carry out checks on the goods, including with respect to the identification of the authorised CBAM declarant, the eight-digit CN code, the quantity and the country of origin of the imported goods, the date of declaration and the customs procedure. The Commission should include the risks relating to CBAM in the design of the common risk criteria and standards pursuant to Article 50 of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013  - The CBAM should be based on a declarative system where an authorised CBAM declarant, who may act on its own behalf or represent one or more importers, submits annually a declaration of the embedded emissions in the goods imported to the customs territory of the Union and surrenders a number of CBAM certificates corresponding to those declared emissions.  - An authorised CBAM declarant should be allowed to claim a reduction in the number of CBAM certificates to be surrendered corresponding to the carbon price already effectively paid for those emissions in other jurisdictions. The amending Regulation proposes to introduce a default carbon price which would allow declarants to claim a deduction where it cannot be demonstrated that a carbon price has been effectively paid.  - The embedded declared emissions should be verified by a person accredited by an EU national accreditation body where actual emissions are declared.  - The CBAM central system should allow operators of production installations in third countries to register in the CBAM registry and to make their verified embedded GHG emissions from production of goods available to authorised CBAM declarants. The Commission should manage the CBAM registry containing data on the authorised CBAM declarants, operators and installations in third countries. The amending Regulation proposes to allow accredited verifiers to access the registry to improve the reliability of emission data shared by operators with declarants through the registry.  - To reduce the risk of carbon leakage the Commission should take action to address practices of circumvention  - For the sale and re-purchase of CBAM certificates a common central platform should be established. For the purpose of oversight of the transactions on the common central platform, the Commission should facilitate the exchanges of information and the cooperation between competent authorities, and between those authorities and the Commission. Additionaly, a swift flow of information between the common central platform and the CBAM registry should be establised.  - The Commission should carry out risk-based controls and should review the content of the CBAM declarations accordingly. For enforcement purposes, Member States may also carry out reviews of individual CBAM declarations. The conclusions of the reviews of individual CBAM declarations should be shared with the Commission and should be made available to other competent authorities in the CBAM registry.  - Member States should be responsible for the correct establishment and collection of revenues arising from the application of this Regulation.  Therefore, during the definitive period the number of tasks attributed to the EC increase drastically, requiring an increase in staffing needs. The tasks carried out by this team will include the supervision of authorisation of CBAM declarants made by MS competent authorities, the management of the central database and central registry, coordination and information exchange with MS competent authorities, review of declarations and oversight of the external platform and lastly, tasks requiring legal competencies such as litigation and recovery and financial responsibility oversight. The structure of the team is further defined below.  During the definitive period the Commission will be in charge of the majority of the tasks resulting from the CBAM regulation.  CBAM IT Budget  The CBAM Budget to be engaged/ committed for the period 2023-2027 have been assessed at 101,74 M€.The CBAM IT budget encompasses Analysis & Development services, Deployment services, Operations services, cloud services and/or on premises hardware and software licenses for the Transitional and Definitive CBAM System as detailed below :  - The CAPEX cost has been estimated based on the actual budget engaged and the budget authorised by EC IT Corporate Governance in the form of approved Vision Documents for the following past projects of DG TAXUD IT projects, due to their similarities in terms of IT Architecture Model: CDS, CRMS2, SURV3, REX, CSRD2, EBTI, Customs Trans-European Declaration Management Systems developed and operated by DG TAXUD.  - The OPEX cost has been assessed on the basis of the current annual infrastructure and operational costs of DG TAXUD, their provisions for IT infrastructure, IT Support and Service Desk activities for the production systems delivered by the projects referenced above.  - The pricing is based on the current Framework Contracts pricing in place.  In the IT Policy budget line, the budget of the joint procurement between the COM and MS of the platform for buying and selling of certificates for managing operations is not included.  The CBAM team would consist of 90 EC staff (including 15 IT staff) in 2027.  The amending Regulation proposes to introduce rationalisations of administrative requirements, including reporting. Since those requirements were introduced by Union Law, their rationalization is also  best done at EU level to ensure legal certainty and consistency of reporting. This change corresponds to additional IT cost of 18,95 M€ for the period of 2025-2027.  This will ensure a level playing field for companies and authorities across the Union, which will be benefiting from the rationalisation of reporting requirements arising from this proposal.

The CBAM IT team consists of 15 members of specialised IT profiles for defining and managing CBAM IT System Architecture and Project Organisation and planning, the activities in terms of development, deployment, the organisation of the Service Model, the management of operations and support in front of Trade, COM services, climatic and Customs authorities, in parallel of the Transitional and definitive CBAM IT systems.  The CBAM IT team would consist of 15 EC staff structured as presented in the graph below:  The proposed plan of deploying the CBAM IT team is the following:  Table: Row 1 — Year; 2023; 2024; 2025; 2026; 2027 Row 2 — No of Resources; 8; 12; 15; 15; 15 Row 3 — AD; 4; 5; 5; 5; 5 Row 4 — CA; 4; 7; 10; 10; 10  1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, great er effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this section 'added value of EU involvement' is the value resulting from EU action, that is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.  Reasons for action at EU level (ex-ante) Reducing GHG emissions is fundamentally a trans-boundary issue that requires effective action at the largest possible scale. The EU as a supranational organisation is well-placed to establish effective climate policy in the EU, like it has done with the EU ETS.  There exists already a harmonised carbon price at EU level. This consists of the price resulting from the EU ETS for the sectors covered by the system. The only meaningful way to ensure equivalence between the carbon pricing policy applied in the EU’s internal market and the carbon pricing policy applied on imports is to take action at the level of the Union.  Any initiative needs to be implemented in a way that provides importers, regardless of country of origin and port of entry or destination within the EU, with uniform conditions and incentives for GHG emission reductions that are equivalent to those of domestic producers. The single effective way to do this is by taking action at the level of the EU.  The proposed simplification introduced by the amending Regulation is best done at EU level to ensure legal certainty and consistency. This will ensure a level playing field for companies and authorities across the Union, which will be benefiting from the rationalisation of reporting requirements arising from this proposal.  Expected generated  EU added value (ex-post) In parallel to the EU ETS, reduction of GHG emissions and protection against the risk of carbon leakage in the EU single market can be established most adequately at the EU level. Additionally, the need for minimal administrative costs is best achieved by establishing consistent rules for the entire single market, further underlining the added value of an intervention at the EU level.  The public consultation has confirmed the added value of taking action on the CBAM at the EU level. In particular, stakeholders agree that an EU CBAM is needed due to existing differences of ambition between the EU and the rest of the world and in order to support the global climate efforts. In addition, in view of the EU’s position in international trade, if it introduces a CBAM the environmental effect on international climate ambitions will be most effective as a potential example to follow.  Thus, the objective of reducing emissions and climate neutrality requires – without equally ambitious global policies – action by the European Union.  1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past  The CBAM is a new mechanism. The preferred option in the Impact Assessment draws from the EU Emissions Trading System and aims at replicating some of its features.  If sufficient ressources are not made available to enforce CBAM correctly, there is a serious risk that businesses will avoid CBAM.  The amending proposal relies on the experience gained in implementing CBAM since the mechanism started to apply in its transitional phase on 1 October 2023.  1.5.4. Compatibility with the multiannual financial framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments  In the interinstitutonal agreement of 16 December 2020, signed in the context of the negotiations, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed that ""the institutions will work towards introducing sufficient new own resources with a view to covering an amount corresponding to the expected expenditure related to the repayment"" of NextGenerationEU. As part of the mandate received, the Commission was invited to put forward a proposal for a CBAM in the first semester of 2021.  The final agreement by co-legislators foresees that most of the implementation and enforcement of CBAM will be the responsibility of the Commission. Therefore, in order to ensure the correct deployment of the proposal the appropriate financing means need to be made available within the current MFF.  The amending proposal is consistent with the objective of the better regulation agenda, as it will strengthen the Commission’s ability to carry out its general supervision of CBAM, while reducing administrative the costs (notably for small importers, but also for Member States’ authorities) that would otherwise be incurred in collecting the information through other means.  1.5.5.

Comments  N/A  2. MANAGEMENT MEASURES  2.1. Monitoring and reporting rules  The Commission will ensure that arrangements are in place to monitor and evaluate the functioning of the CBAM and evaluate it against the main policy objectives.  Before the end of the transitional period at the end of 2025 and every two years thereafter, the Commission will publish comprehensive assessments of the functioning of the CBAM, including its governance. The 2025 report will also review the scope of the CBAM to examine the possibility of extending it to cover emissions of other EU ETS sectors at risk of carbon leakage, products further down the value chain as well indirect emissions for all sectors. For this, it is necessary to monitor the effect of CBAM on the shortlisted sectors.  2.2. Management and control system(s)  2.2.1. Justification of the budget implementation method(s), the funding implementation mechanism(s), the payment modalities and the control strategy proposed  A significantly centralised set-up allows a very uniform and efficient implementation of CBAM across the EU including in Member states with more limited administrative capacity on climate issues. The majority of the implementation and enforcement functions have been attributed to Commission services. These also require an increased number of control functions in order to ensure the correct implementation and management of the CBAM. The Commission has also foreseen an increased number of measures for fraud prevention.  While this simplification package will significantly reduce the administrative burden for importers, notably SMEs, as well as national authorities, this is made possible by Commission services taking up increased responsibilities and more tasks, notably in the monitoring and enforcement.  2.2.2. Information concerning the risks identified and the internal control system(s) set up to mitigate them  The CBAM will be based on a declarative system, which entails the risk of non-declaration or misdeclaration.  In order to address the risk of non-declaration, the system requires an authorisation before importing goods in the scope of the Regulation. National Customs Authorities will be in charge of enforcing this rule by not releasing into free circulation these goods as long as the declarant is not authorised according to this Regulation.  In order to address the risk of misdeclaration a system of auditing on risk assessment criteria as well as random audits will be in place coupled with sanctions set up as a sufficiently high level to serve as deterrent. Auditing will take place both at the level of CBAM declaration by the national authorities and at the level of import declarations by customs authorities.  2.2.3. Estimation and justification of the cost-effectiveness of the controls (ratio between the control costs  and the value of the related funds managed), and assessment of the expected levels of risk of error (at payment & at closure)  Commission services will control the correct application of CBAM, in particular the surrender of CBAM certificates and the correct application of the de minimis threshold. A strong risk management system will be applied to ensure cost-effective controls and tackle risks of circumvention.  2.3. Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities  The financial interests of the Union should be protected through proportionate measures throughout the expenditure cycle, including the prevention, detection and investigation of irregularities, the recovery of funds lost, wrongly paid or incorrectly used and, where appropriate, administrative and financial penalties.  Efficient anti-fraud actions require active cooperation, including knowledge-sharing and exchange of information, between customs authorities and competent authorities, both at national level and EU level; it may also require cooperation with third countries. A specific attention should be drawn to non-reliable economic operators (e.g. shell company, missing traders) and cross-border trade inside the EU.  Quick anti-fraud action should be put in place to react to new/newly detected fraud risks. Authorities in charge should report and share knowledge on fraudulent patterns.  Where an authorised CBAM declarant or an importer fails to comply with the obligations in the CBAM regulation, penalties will be applied. The amount of the penalty will be based on penalties in the EU ETS.  In case of repeated offences, the national competent authority may decide to suspend the account of the declarant.  Commission services, together with national competent authorities and national customs, have set up CBAM risk management network, which will work on a joint anti-circumvention strategy.  3.

Compatibility with the current multiannual financial framework  The proposal/initiative:  –  can be fully financed through redeployment within the relevant heading of the multiannual financial framework (MFF)  –  requires use of the unallocated margin under the relevant heading of the MFF and/or use of the special instruments as defined in the MFF Regulation  –  requires a revision of the MFF  Additional IT expenditures are needed to cover IT development needed to implement changes related to implementation of the CBAM simplification procedures and implement the IT tools supporting detection of the irregularities and limiting the risk of fraud: 6.350M in 2025, 6.850M in 2026 and 5.750M in 2027 – in commitment appropriations. In addition, 2M are needed on an annual basis to cover studies, including to assess regularly the effectiveness of the CBAM as well as outreach activities, including external communication and training sessions with stakeholders. These costs were not covered in the previous LFS. The proposal requires transfering up to 25M from Heading 4 (11.0301 – CCEI) to Heading 3 (09.200401 – CBAM).  3.2.7.

For assigned revenue, specify the budget expenditure line(s) affected.  CBAM – 09 20 04 01  Other remarks (e.g. method/formula used for calculating the impact on revenue or any other information).  Estimates on share of revenue affected was based on internal Commission calculations using Customs import data and default values. These were applied on revenue estimates from the Commission’s 2021 impact assessment, which stood at approximately EUR 2.1 billion in 2030.  Since less than 1% of emissions would not be captured under the new de minimis threshold, the foregone implied revenue for the year 2030 due to emissions not captured is estimated at approximately EUR 21,000,000.  4. Digital dimension s  There are not changes in that Digital concepts and architecture approved by CBAM Definitive system project charter, in terms of digital requirements, data used, digital solution, reusability assessment and Measures to support digital implementation.  The only change is related to the Risk management, Circumvention monitoring which was analyse and assessed and included in Project charter as place holder but not included in the Project Charter estimates. The key objective of the Risk management component is supporting detection of the irregularities and limiting the risk of fraud  Also, the simplification changes do not result in a change of the digital solution architecture, however, requires additional budget to implement the change to features and services already build by CBAM.  4.1. Requirements of digital relevance  Table: Row 1 — As shown in diagram abvoe , the CBAM Registry gets import information for the CBAM goods from the EU Customs systems either from the MS or via DG TAXUD, along with the importers customs identification and the Customs classification of the imported goods. The CBAM system makes in return the CBAM authorisations of the CBAM Declarants available to the National Customs Import Systems to enforce the CBAM regulation at the import clearance of the CBAM goods. The CBAM Information system exchanges as well risk management information with the EU Customs systems. The interface with the EU Customs Systems is a vital feed for the operation of CBAM as the whole concept of CBAM is to avoid double capture of information by requesting the CBAM Declarants to complement their imports with a report of the emission incurred during their production in third Countries. The “data provided once” is a basic principle of CBAM. CBAM will also interact with the new CBAM Mechanism (IT systems or other means) of the National Competent Authorities to foster the integration of the national CBAM enforcement processes across the MS and the national processes for the collection of penalties and recovery information. Another key new external system for CBAM is the Common Central Platform (CCP), the Information System by which the CBAM Declarants will purchase the CBAM certificates from the Member States. The price of the certificates will be set by the allowance price defined in the ETS system. The CBAM Declarants will need to keep their CBAM accounts in an 80% balance on a quarterly basis to ensure that they are in position to surrender the required number of certificates for offsetting their declared emissions and emission prices already paid in third Countries. The Commission will re‑purchase the surplus certificates from the CBAM Declarants in name of the Member States. The Commission and the Member States must jointly establish and manage this platform, which is however outside the scope of the CBAM Registry. The interface with the CCP is vital for the CBAM Declarants to provision the necessary certificates in their CBAM accounts. The accounts and the certificates will be highly sensitive information. The ETS system will simply set the selling price of the certificates. The primary users of the CBAM Registry are the CBAM Declarants. DG TAXUD anticipates that they may amount to 200.000 in 2026 (following the adoption of the simplification the number of declarants will be reduced but it will be further extended by the CBAM extension for the downstream goods). They will use the CBAM Registry to declare the emission accrued on the production of their imported goods on a yearly basis (May of each year), to monitor the quarterly balance of their CBAM accounts in term of certificates versus declared imports and to interact with the National Customs Authorities during review of their CBAM declarations. The CBAM Declarants will first be vetted by the National Competent Authorities via the CBAM Registry and then be granted an authorisation to import CBAM goods and be given a CBAM account. The CBAM Declarants will then be able to declare annually their emissions in the CBAM Registry and to surrender the required certificates. The Operators of the Installations producing the CBAM goods in the third countries will register on the CBAM Registry before entering the emission details of their products. The CBAM Declarants will be able to refer to the entries of the Operators to justify their reported emission. It is a significant measure to reduce the compliance burden of the CBAM Declarants and to improve the quality of the CBAM data. While there is no evidence to support an estimate at this stage, DG TAXUD guestimates the number of Operators at 50.000 in 2026. The CBAM National Competent Authorities (NCA) will use the CBAM Registry to grant the access to the CBAM Declarants, to manage the CBAM Authorisations, to monitor the CBAM accounts and declarations and interact with the CBAM Declarants to ensure their compliance with the CBAM regulation. They are the single point of contact to the CBAM Declarants. Other Authorities will be granted access to the CBAM Registry to contribute to the risk management and the enforcement from their respective areas of responsibilities. The CBAM Registry will coordinate and support the inter-agencies collaboration in fostering compliance. The National Customs Administrations will validate the CBAM Authorisation during the control of the import declarations using the replication and validation services of the CBAM Registry via the EU CSW-CERTEX. The Commission will assign and maintain the CBAM accounts of the CBAM Declarants up to date in the CBAM Registry, combining the information from the imports received from National Customs Administrations, the emissions from the yearly declarations, the quantity of certificates, their purchase reported by the CCP, their yearly surrendering confirmed by the CBAM Declarant, and the re-purchase of unused certificates. The Commission will use the CBAM Registry to monitor the imported goods and associated emissions, for the risk management, and particularly the risk of circumvention. The CBAM Registry will also offer a secure forum for the exchange of sensitive information between all Authorities having a responsibility in the enforcement of the CBAM regulation. The access of all actors to the CBAM Registry via dedicated portals supported by a distributed access management across the stakeholders: · The NCA will manage the access of the CBAM Declarants to the CBAM Declarant portal, using either national credentials already granted by the National Customs Administrations or an EU login one; · The Commission will manage the access of the Operators of the third countries Installations, to the same name portal, using credentials granted by EU login. It remains to be clarified whether the Commission will rely on external trusted parties to delegate them the granting of the authorisation to access the CBAM Registry; · The NCA, the Commission and other Authorities will each manage the access to their users. The CBAM Core Registry depicts the automated processes that the Commission will operate to fulfil its obligations under the CBAM regulation, as summarised above. The Reference Data Management will be a key -office process ensuring the consistency and integrity of all automated processes serving the collaboration and cooperation between all stakeholders. Beyond the “simple” list of goods, of National Competent Authorities, and of the price of emission, they will list the specific parameters used to report emissions according to specific methodologies and the default value for the emissions as established. The default value is key for the plausibility validation of the declared emissions.  4.2. Data  Table: Row 1 — CBAM will be processing following data assets · CBAM Declarant Data.

Digital solutions  Table: Row 1 — CBAM Registry High Level architecture will be made of 3 layers: · The portal layer offering different portals for each of the user communities of the CBAM Registry: CBAM Declarants, Operators of the third countries Installations, CBAM National Competent Authorities, the Commission, The National Customs Administrations, OLAF, and other EC services; · The User Access Management layer : to manage the Authentication and Authorisation of the users of the CBAM Registry. The National Competent Authorities will need to provide and manage the access of the CBAM Declarants (expected to be above 200.000 parties in 2026) while the Commission will do the same for the third countries Operators (estimated at 50.000 parties in 2026) each MS and EU administrations being in charge of the access of its own users;, each MS and EU administrations being in charge of the access of its own users; · The Back End : to support all data and rule management required for CBAM as well as all interactions with external systems. To be noted that: to support all data and rule management required for CBAM as well as all interactions with external systems. To be noted that: o CBAM will implement numerous workflows, notifications, and exchanges of information across the Commission, the National Competent Authorities and the CBAM Declarants, in particular in the areas of declaration submission, review (including risk assessment); o The management of the Declarant accounts, the management CBAM certificates (potentially financial assets), the risk management and the secure exchange of information have high security requirements.  4.4. Interoperability assessment  Table: Row 1 — CBAM is cross border by design as it supports the CBAM lifecycle across the EU, and in particular the orchestration of the Risk Assessment, review of the CBAM Declarations across all NCA and the Commission. Collaboration across National Customs systems will be ensured, by leveraging the Commission’s IT services and interfaces (such as SURV3, EU CSW - CERTEX), as well as new components, specifically designed for CBAM purposes. The CBAM Registry has been designed to support interoperability by emphasizing use on openness, modularity, decoupling and robust interfaces. It will interact with the CBAM national systems, with the Common Central Platform, the EU Customs systems from DG TAXUD and the National Customs Administrations, with the other DG’s systems via open interfaces The CBAM Central Repository will use the existing interfaces of the EU Customs Systems managed by DG TAXUD and will define dedicated formats for the Customs Import and Inward Processing records to be provided by the National Customs Administrations. The new interfaces with the National Customs Systems will be published early 2024 to allow the National Customs Administrations enough lead time to prepare their systems accordingly. The S2S interface between the CBAM Registry and the CCP will be based on structured messages exchange and be available early 2024 to allow enough lead time for both the CBAM Registry and the CCP to integrate their respective interfaces by mid-2025. The S2S interface between the CBAM Registry and the CBAM National Systems (to be developed by the MS) will be based on structured message exchanges and also be made available early 2024. The S2S interface with the systems of the other EU Authorities will be specified and developed on a bilateral basis during the elaboration and build of the CBAM Registry. All these interfaces will be structured messages based and will comply as far as possible with the EUCDM and with the UCC Annex B. The A2B and B2B specifications will be referred in a CBAM Implementing Act Reusability Constraints The reusability is at the very heart of the architecture principles adopted for the CBAM Central Register. There are two sides to the reusability: use of external services by the CBAM Registry and re-use components in the build of the CBAM Registry. Reusability from DG TAXUD services and components The CBAM Registry will use the EU Customs Services offered by DG TAXUD out of the box to: · retrieve the EORI information of the trader; · get the customs import records available from Surveillance 3; · get the CBAM goods from the TARIC system; · offer the CBAM Authorisations Replication and Validation service to the National Customs Systems via the EU CSW-CERTEX and; · exchange secure information with the CRMS2 system. The user access management of the portals of the CBAM Registry will be entrusted to UUM&DS, allowing the willing MS to re-use the Customs credentials of the CBAM Declarants to provide them access to the CBAM Declarant portal and the Commission (or trusted third parties) to grant access right to the Operators of the third countries Installations to their EU Login authentication credentials. The CBAM Registry will reuse several technology components of the DG TAXUD and Corporate IT landscape without compromising its compliance with the floatability principle spelt out in the Architecture Overview in appendix 2, namely: · The DG TAXUD TSOAP middleware architecture which will be reused in each of the CBAM Registry compartments; · The monitoring and auditing COTS Elk and Kafka; · The sources of the Customs application framework management (TATAFng) of DG TAXUD; · The documentation and source code of the Customs Decision Management System of DG TAXUD for the built of the CBAM Authorisation system; · The documentation and source code of the Customer Reference System of DG TAXUD to provision the CBAM Authorisations to the National Customs Systems for their control during the import clearance; · The documentation and source code of the Customs Risk Management System 2 (CRMS2) of DG TAXUD to provision the Secure Forum for Exchange of Information; · The DG TAXUD TEMPO methodology, including PM²; · The 2 Data Centres of DG TAXUD for the testing, integration and for as long as the CBAM Registry operation is entrusted to DG TAXUD, along with their firewalling, Active-Active clustering, the load balancing and the 2 DC Active-Passive to ensure the scalability, High Availability, Disaster Recovery, some of the security needed by the CBAM Registry. To be noted that DG TAXUD has followed all recommendations from DIGIT since 2014 when designing Business Application Services, Data Services and Utility Services for its generation of SOA applications. Reusability from EU corporate services and components The CBAM Registry will use EU Login for the authentication of the CBAM declarants of the MS being UUM&DS type D, of the Operators of the third Countries Installations and all officials of the National Competent Authorities, of the Commission, of the National Customs Administration and other Commission services. The CBAM Registry will use the Customs eIDAS eID network for the authentication of the CBAM Declarants from the MS UUM&DS type A, B & C. The CBAM Registry will use UUM&DS for the authorisation of all its users. A migration from UUM&DS to EU Access will be considered when all functionalities of UUM&DS will be offered by EU Access, including the support of the Customs eIDAS eID network. The CBAM Registry will make available the CBAM public information on Europa. In addition, DG TAXUD is keen to maximize the re-use of Corporate services and components that would meet some of the CBAM requirements, de-risk its timely deployment and secure the quality of its operation while lowering its CAPEX and OPEX.  4.5. Measures to support digital i mplementation  Table: Row 1 — The CBAM regulation defines the deployment of the CBAM Registry in two periods declined in 3 consecutive phases: · Period perspective : a progressive deployment during a Transitional Period from the Q4 2023 until the Q4 2025, followed by a Definitive Period from Q1 2026. o During the Transitional Period, the CBAM importers report the emission of their imported goods quarterly but do not have to purchase and surrender certificates. It is the running in period of the CBAM scheme. o During the Definitive Period , starting on 01 January 2026, the CBAM Declarants must be authorised, they declare their emissions once per year, they purchase certificates to keep their CBAM account at minimum 80% balance between their emissions and the purchased certificates, and they surrender their certificates with their yearly declarations. · Phase & Part perspective : o CBAM Phase 1 : the “CBAM reports” by the importers of CBAM goods (so called Part 1), to be used during the whole Transitional Period as from Q4 2023 (out of scope of the Project Charter); o CBAM Phase 2: the “CBAM reports” provided by the importers of CBAM goods (Part 1), the CBAM Declarant Authorisation and the registration of the Operators of third countries Installations (so called Part 2) as from 31 December 2024 in anticipation of the Definitive Period; o CBAM Phase 3: The Part 2 augmented with the CBAM declarations and certificates along with the full CBAM account management (so called Part 3) as from the start of the Definitive Period but without Part 1 “CBAM Reports” as from the end of the Transitional Period 31 December 2025.  Table: Row 1 — Deployment in two phases/parts of the CBAM Registry The CBAM Phase 1 (implementation of CBAM Part 1 and its operation from Q4 2023 until end 2025 is entirely covered by the Project Charter of the Transitional Period The two figures below illustrate the approach to deliver the full scope of the Definitive System in two phases, depicting the user communities, the external systems at play and the main entities being managed in the scope of the respective phases. Refer to the next section for the definition of the external systems and entities. CBAM Part 2 Scope: on top of Part 1, The “CBAM reports” by the importers of CBAM goods, comes the Part 2 “CBAM Authorisation and Installations” (both in green in the following diagrams), which will enter in operation on 31 December 2024 as mandated by the CBAM regulation. Both Part 1 and Part 2 will then be further maintained and evolved during the remaining of the Transitional Period. The “CBAM Authorisation and Installation” will be integrated in the CBAM Definitive System while the “CBAM reports” will be phased out at the end of the Transitional Period. The Part 1 and Part 2 interface the CBAM Registry with the National Customs Import Systems, with the National Customs Inward Processing Systems and the supporting EU Customs systems of DG TAXUD to foster compliance at minimal burden for trade. CBAM Part 2 comes in anticipation of the Definitive System by delivering its first component. The CBAM Phase 2 Timeline : It starts on the 31 December 2024 and ends on the 31 December 2025 with the start of the Definitive Period. The user community is extended to the Operators of the Installations in the third countries while the CBAM Declarants will need to obtain the required authorisations for the Definitive Period.  Table: Row 1 — CBAM Part 3 Scope: The “CBAM Declarations, Accounts and Risk Management” part (in purple in the following diagram), will enter in operations at the start of the Definitive Period scheduled for the 1 January 2026. It constitutes the core of the CBAM definitive system. CBAM Part 3 also includes the interfaces with the National Import Systems for the CBAM Authorisations via the EU CSW-CERTEX, the Common Central Platform for the purchasing of CBAM Certificates, ETS, OLAF, and the Systems of the National Competent Authorities. Furthermore, it adds the CBAM Certificates capabilities to the CBAM Registry as well as all the Risk Management ones. As the CBAM Certificates and Risk Management modules handle confidential information and monitor cases of circumvention and non-compliance, CBAM Part 3 manages sensitive information and requires highly secure processes. This part will be further maintained and evolved during the Definitive Period. The CBAM Phase 3 Timeline : It starts on the 1 January 2026 and matches with the Definitive Period. During this phase, only the parts 2 & 3 of CBAM will operate in parallel and in close interaction, as the Part 1 was specific for the Transitional Period and is phased out. The user community is extended to the National Customs Administrations CBAM Part 3 Scope: The “CBAM Declarations, Accounts and Risk Management” part (in purple in the following diagram), will enter in operations at the start of the Definitive Period scheduled for the 1 January 2026. It constitutes the core of the CBAM definitive system. CBAM Part 3 also includes the interfaces with the National Import Systems for the CBAM Authorisations via the EU CSW-CERTEX, the Common Central Platform for the purchasing of CBAM Certificates, ETS, OLAF, and the Systems of the National Competent Authorities. Furthermore, it adds the CBAM Certificates capabilities to the CBAM Registry as well as all the Risk Management ones. As the CBAM Certificates and Risk Management modules handle confidential information and monitor cases of circumvention and non-compliance, CBAM Part 3 manages sensitive information and requires highly secure processes. This part will be further maintained and evolved during the Definitive Period. The CBAM Phase 3 Timeline : It starts on the 1 January 2026 and matches with the Definitive Period. During this phase, only the parts 2 & 3 of CBAM will operate in parallel and in close interaction, as the Part 1 was specific for the Transitional Period and is phased out. The user community is extended to the National Customs Administrations.

(2) point 4.1 is amended as follows :  (a) the fourth sentence is replaced by the following:  ‘When reliable data for the exporting country cannot be applied for a type of goods, the default values shall be based on the average emission intensity of the ten exporting countries with the highest emission intensities for which reliable data can be applied for that type of goods.’;  (b) the fifth sentence is deleted;  (3) in point 7 , the second paragraph is replaced by the following:  ‘Where declarants for goods produced in a third country, a group of third countries or a region within a third country can demonstrate, on the basis of reliable data, that alternative region-specific adaptations of default values are lower than the default values determined by the Commission, such region-specific adaptations can be used.’  ANNEX II  The following Annex VII is added:  ‘ANNEX VII  Threshold referred to in Article 2(3a)  1. The threshold referred to in Article 2(3a) shall be set at 50 tonnes of net mass.  2. For determining the threshold, the following methodology shall be applied:  Where:  – is the mass -threshold in tonnes allowing to capture a given target share of emissions;  – Annual emissions per importer; ;  – is the imported volume in tonnes by importer of the CN code ;  – is the number of CN codes imported by importer among the four sectors considered (aluminium, cement, fertilisers, iron and steel);  – is the emission intensity for CN code 1  – : the total emissions in CO2 of the four CBAM sectors considered, that is the sum of corresponding emissions for all importers: , where is the number of importers;  – : the total volume in tonnes of CBAM goods imported by importer ;  – is an indicator function equal to when (that is, when an importer is importing volumes higher than the mass-threshold ), 0 otherwise.  To capture uncertainty over changes in trade patterns while maintaining the environmental objective of this Regulation, a margin of 0.25 percentage points is added to the level of 99% of the embedded emissions as referred to in Article 2(3a) of this Regulation.  For simplicity, the threshold shall be rounded to the nearest ten.  By July of each calendar year, the Commission shall, based on import data covering a reference period of 12 months preceding the month 2 of this assessment, assess whether the value derived from the methodology deviates by more than 5 tonnes from the threshold laid down in point 1.’",['https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-10-2025-0178_EN.html'],"European Parliament legislative resolution of 10 September 2025 on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) 2023/956 as regards simplifying and strengthening the carbon border adjustment mechanism ( COM(2025)0087 – C10-0035/2025 – 2025/0039(COD) )

of 8 October 2025
amending Regulation (EU) 2023/956 as regards simplifying and strengthening the carbon border adjustment mechanism
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192(1) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee(1),
After consulting the Committee of the Regions,
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure(2),
Whereas:
(1) Since the start of the transitional period on 1 October 2023 laid down in Regulation (EU) 2023/956 of the European Parliament and of the Council(3), the Commission has been collecting data and information on the implementation of the carbon border adjustment mechanism (the ‘CBAM’) as provided for therein, including through the analysis of quarterly reports submitted by reporting declarants. The information collected and the exchanges with the stakeholders, including exchanges within the expert group on the CBAM, have indicated areas to simplify and strengthen the CBAM in line with the Union’s commitment to ensure a smooth implementation of the CBAM once the transitional period ends on 1 January 2026.
(2) Based on the experience acquired and data collected during the transitional period on the distribution of importers of goods listed in Annex I of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 into the Union, only a small proportion of those importers account for the vast majority of emissions embedded in imported goods. The derogation applied to the importation of goods of negligible value, namely those not exceeding a total of EUR 150 per consignment, referred to in Article 23 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1186/2009(4)appears insufficient to ensure that the CBAM applies to importers in proportion to the impact of those importers on the emissions covered by Regulation (EU) 2023/956. For importers of small quantities of goods, compliance with reporting and financial obligations laid down in Regulation (EU) 2023/956 could be unduly burdensome. A new derogation should therefore be introduced to exempt from obligations under Regulation (EU) 2023/956 importers of small quantities in terms of mass of goods listed in Annex I of that Regulation, while preserving the environmental objective of the CBAM and its capacity to achieve the envisaged climate objective.
(3) A new threshold based on cumulative net mass of the imported goods in a given calendar year per importer (the ‘single mass-based threshold’) should be introduced in Regulation (EU) 2023/956, and initially be set at a level of 50 tonnes. A single mass-based threshold should apply cumulatively to all goods in the sectors of iron and steel, aluminium, fertilisers and cement. Where the net mass of all goods imported by an importer in a given calendar year does not cumulatively exceed the single mass-based threshold, such an importer, including any importer with the status of an authorised CBAM declarant, should be exempted in a given calendar year from the obligations under Regulation (EU) 2023/956 (the ‘de minimisexemption’). Where, within a relevant calendar year, an importer exceeds the single mass-based threshold, that importer should be subject to obligations under Regulation (EU) 2023/956 in respect of all emissions embedded in all goods imported during that relevant calendar year, including, in particular, the obligation to obtain the status of authorised CBAM declarant, the obligation to submit a CBAM declaration in respect of all emissions embedded in all goods imported in that relevant calendar year and the obligation to purchase and surrender CBAM certificates in respect of all those emissions.
(4) In the electricity and hydrogen sectors, key features such as quantity of imports, trade patterns, customs information and emission intensities differ substantially from those in the iron and steel, aluminium, fertilisers and cement sectors. Those differences imply that making electricity and hydrogen imports subject to a single mass-based threshold would require introducing complex adjustments that would not allow for the substantial reduction of administrative costs for importers in those sectors. Imports of electricity or hydrogen should therefore not be included under thede minimisexemption.
(5) The establishment of the single mass-based threshold that reflects the average emissions intensity of the quantity of the imported goods pursues the objective of ensuring that at least 99 % of emissions embedded in imported goods remain within the scope of the CBAM and that therefore thede minimisexemption applies to no more than 1 % of emissions embedded in imported goods. Thede minimisexemption would represent a robust and targeted approach as it accurately reflects the environmental nature and the climate objective of the CBAM while substantially reducing the CBAM-related administrative burden for importers, the vast majority of whom will be exempted from the obligations under Regulation (EU) 2023/956. At the same time, the CBAM continues to apply to at least 99 % of emissions embedded in the imported goods. Such a single mass-based threshold also eliminates the risk of circumvention through an artificial splitting of consignments by a single importer.
(6) The Commission should each year assess, on the basis of import data for the preceding 12 calendar months, whether a material change has occurred in the average emission intensities of the goods or in the pattern of trade in goods, including practices of circumvention. In order to ensure that at least 99 % of emissions embedded in the imported goods remain within the scope of the CBAM, the Commission should adopt delegated acts in order to amend the single mass-based threshold by using the methodology set out in point 2 of Annex VII of Regulation (EU) 2023/956. To ensure effectiveness and certainty, the Commission should only adopt such acts where the value of the resulting threshold deviates from the applicable threshold by more than 15 tonnes. Where the single mass-based threshold is amended, it should apply as from the beginning of the following calendar year.
(7) To ensure that the derogation is sufficiently targeted, the single mass-based threshold should apply to each importer, including those importers with the status of authorised CBAM declarant. For that purpose, imports of an importer should be taken into account irrespective of whether they have been declared by the importer itself or an indirect customs representative. The indirect customs representative, due to the nature of its activity and the related obligations under Regulation (EU) 2023/956, should always be required to obtain the status of an authorised CBAM declarant prior to acting on behalf of an importer in respect of goods listed in Annex I to Regulation (EU) 2023/956. Where an importer represented by one or more indirect customs representatives has exceeded the single mass-based threshold, each indirect customs representative that is acting as an authorised CBAM declarant should submit a CBAM declaration in respect of the goods imported into the customs territory of the Union by that indirect customs representative, including any goods below the single mass-based threshold, for those represented importers that have exceeded the single mass-based threshold, and should surrender the number of CBAM certificates which correspond to emissions embedded in those goods.
(8) For the purposes of legal certainty, it is appropriate to expressly provide that where an indirect customs representative acts as an authorised CBAM declarant on behalf of an importer, the indirect customs representative should be subject to the obligations applicable to that importer pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2023/956, in particular the obligation to submit a CBAM declaration in respect of the goods imported by the indirect customs representative on behalf of that importer and to surrender the CBAM certificates in respect of emissions embedded in those goods. As a result, in the event of non-compliance, it should be the indirect customs representative that is subject to penalties under Regulation (EU) 2023/956. However, the indirect customs representative should not be subject to penalties where an indirect customs representative acting on behalf of an importer established in a Member State has not agreed to act as an authorised CBAM declarant.
(9) Based on customs information, the Commission should monitor the quantities of goods imported to assess compliance with the single mass-based threshold. The competent authorities should also be able to carry out such monitoring. To allow the competent authorities to make an informed decision, it is necessary to lay down appropriate arrangements for making the necessary information and data available to the competent authorities. Each competent authority should be able to request necessary information and evidence from customs authorities, including the name, address and contact information of importers where such information is not otherwise available to the competent authority. Where the customs authorities become aware that an importer has exceeded the single mass-based threshold, including on the basis of information from the competent authority, they should not allow further importation of goods by that importer until the end of the relevant calendar year, or until that importer has obtained the status of authorised CBAM declarant.
(10) An importer that expects to exceed the annual single mass-based threshold should submit an application for an authorisation. Such an importer should obtain the status of authorised CBAM declarant before the single mass-based threshold is exceeded. Importers that have not been granted the authorisation before exceeding the single mass-based threshold should be subject to penalties.
(11) The obligation to obtain the status of authorised CBAM declarant before the single mass-based threshold is exceeded could result in a high number of applications being lodged at the beginning of 2026. In order to facilitate the application of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 after the expiry of transitional provisions, and avoid potential import disruptions, it is appropriate to allow importers and indirect customs representatives that have submitted an application for an authorisation by 31 March 2026 to continue importing the goods in 2026 even after exceeding the single mass-based threshold pending the decision on granting of the authorisation. In order to avoid circumvention of Regulation (EU) 2023/956, where granting of the authorisation is refused, the importers and indirect customs representatives should be subject to penalties in accordance with Article 26(2a) of that Regulation.
(12) To ensure that the definition of an importer covers all relevant customs procedures, it is necessary to amend it to include the case of the simplified customs procedure where only a bill of discharge is presented pursuant to Article 175(5) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/2446(5).
(13) To achieve a balance between the effectiveness of the authorisation procedure and the risk profile of the applicants, the consultation procedure should be optional for the competent authority. The consultation procedure should allow the competent authority to consult other competent authorities and the Commission where it is considered necessary based on the information submitted by the applicant and customs information made available in the CBAM registry.
(14) To provide additional flexibility, the authorised CBAM declarant should be able to delegate the submission of the CBAM declaration to a third party. The authorised CBAM declarant should remain responsible for the submission of the CBAM declaration. In order to enable the authorised CBAM declarant to provide the required delegation and access to a third party, that third party should fulfil certain technical credentials, including holding an Economic Operators Registration and Identification (EORI) number and being established in a Member State.
(15) Authorised CBAM declarants should submit their annual CBAM declaration and surrender the corresponding number of certificates by 30 September of the year following the year of importation of the goods. In order to provide authorised CBAM declarants flexibility to comply with their obligations, a later date of submission would provide authorised CBAM declarants more time to collect the necessary information, ensure that embedded emissions are verified by an accredited verifier, and purchase the corresponding number of CBAM certificates. The date for the cancellation of CBAM certificates should be adjusted accordingly.
(16) The embedded emissions of some aluminium and steel goods currently included in the scope of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 are primarily determined by the embedded emissions of input materials (precursors), while the emissions arising during the production steps of those goods are typically relatively low. Those production steps consist of finishing processes that are carried out by separate installations not covered by the EU emissions trading system (the ‘EU ETS’) as provided for in Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(6), except for the case of integrated facilities. With a view to ensuring coherence with EU ETS rules and to simplifying the application of CBAM rules for operators in third countries, the embedded emissions of those production processes should be excluded from the system boundaries for the calculation of emissions, by aligning the system boundaries of production processes with those covered by the EU ETS.
(17) Electricity generated on the continental shelf or in the exclusive economic zone of a Member State or a third country is considered as originating in that Member State or that third country, respectively. Hydrogen originating on the continental shelf or in the exclusive economic zone of a Member State or a third country is considered as originating in that Member State or that third country, respectively.
(18) Where input materials (precursors) have already been subject to the EU ETS or to a carbon pricing system that is fully linked with the EU ETS, the embedded emissions of those precursors should not be accounted for in the calculation of the embedded emissions of complex goods.
(19) Authorised CBAM declarants are required to submit an annual CBAM declaration containing the calculation of embedded emissions on the basis of either default values or actual values verified by accredited verifiers. Default values should be calculated and made available by the Commission. The verification of embedded emissions should therefore only apply to actual values.
(20) Information collected during the transitional period indicates that reporting declarants have difficulties in obtaining the required information on the carbon price effectively paid in a third country. To facilitate the deduction of the carbon price, the Commission should, where possible, establish an annual average carbon price expressed in EUR/tonne of CO2e of the effective carbon price paid, including on a conservative basis, based on the best available data from reliable, publicly available information and information provided by third countries to the Commission.
(21) The evidence required for the deduction of a carbon price effectively paid relies on information relevant for the determination and verification of actual embedded emissions. Where the embedded emissions are declared on the basis of default values, it should only be possible to claim the deduction of the carbon price by reference to yearly default carbon prices, where available. Furthermore, since the embedded emissions of precursors should not be accounted for where they have already been subject to the EU ETS or to a carbon pricing system that is fully linked with the EU ETS, the carbon price associated with those embedded emissions is not relevant for the deduction.
(22) Authorised CBAM declarants can claim a reduction in the number of CBAM certificates to be surrendered corresponding to the carbon price effectively paid in the country of origin for the declared embedded emissions. Since the carbon price can be paid in a third country other than the country of origin of the imported goods, such a carbon price should also be eligible for deduction.
(23) To improve the reliability of the data on embedded emissions contained in the CBAM registry and to facilitate the submission of data, accredited verifiers should access, upon request from operators in third countries, the CBAM registry to verify the embedded emissions. In addition, parent companies or controlling entities of those operators should be allowed to access the CBAM registry for the purpose of registering and sharing relevant data on behalf of those operators. The operators should be required to provide a corporate or activity registration number to ensure their identification.
(24) To ensure consistency with Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council(7), as well as Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2067(8), a verifier should be a legal person that is accredited for the purpose of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 by a decision of a national accreditation body. In taking that decision, the national accreditation body should take into account the relevant groups of activities under Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2067 for the assessment of the qualifications of the legal person.
(25) To foster the implementation of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 at national level, Member States should ensure that the competent authorities have all the powers necessary for the performance of their functions and duties.
(26) The costs incurred in connection with the establishment, operation and management of the common central platform should be financed by fees payable by authorised CBAM declarants. For the duration of the first joint public procurement contract for the establishment, operation and management of the common central platform, those costs should initially be borne by the general budget of the Union and, to that end, the revenues generated by those fees should be assigned to the Union budget to cover the relevant costs. In view of the nature of the revenues, it is appropriate to treat the revenues as internal assigned revenues. Any revenues remaining after covering those costs should be assigned to the Union budget. The Commission should be empowered to adopt delegated acts that determine the structure and level of fees so that the organisation and use of the common central platform is cost-efficient, that the fees are set so as to strictly cover the relevant costs and that undue administrative costs are avoided. The Commission should also adopt delegated acts that determine for the duration of the subsequent joint procurement contracts that the fees should directly finance the costs of the operation and management of the platform.
(27) To provide authorised CBAM declarants sufficient time to prepare for compliance with the amended obligations under Regulation (EU) 2023/956, Member States should start selling CBAM certificates in 2027 for emissions embedded in goods imported during the year 2026. The price of CBAM certificates purchased in 2027 and corresponding to emissions embedded in goods imported into the Union in 2026 should reflect the prices of EU ETS allowances in 2026.
(28) The obligation for the authorised CBAM declarants to ensure that the number of CBAM certificates on their account in the CBAM registry at the end of each quarter corresponds to at least 80 % of the emissions embedded in the goods they have imported since the start of the year is insufficiently tailored to the expected financial adjustment. It is therefore necessary to both reduce the percentage from 80 % to 50 % and integrate the free allocation of EU ETS allowances. Furthermore, the authorised CBAM declarant should be able to rely on the information submitted in the CBAM declaration in the previous year for the same goods and same third countries.
(29) Similarly, the repurchase limit should align more accurately with the number of CBAM certificates which the authorised CBAM declarants are required to purchase during the year of importation.
(30) Since CBAM certificates are cancelled without any compensation, there is no need for an exchange of information from the common central platform to the CBAM registry at the end of the working day.
(31) Where an authorised CBAM declarant fails to surrender the correct number of CBAM certificates as a result of incorrect information provided by a third party, namely an operator, a verifier or an independent person certifying the carbon price documentation, the competent authorities, when applying penalties, should be able to take into account the specific circumstances concerned, such as the duration, gravity, scope, intentional or negligent nature or repetition of the non-compliance or the level of cooperation of the authorised CBAM declarant. This would allow for a reduction of the amount of the penalty where minor or unintentional errors are made.
(32) Importers other than authorised CBAM declarants that have exceeded the single mass-based threshold should be subject to a penalty provided in Article 26(2a). For that purpose, the entirety of the emissions embedded in the goods imported by such an importer without authorisation in the relevant calendar year should be taken into account. It is appropriate to provide that the payment of the penalty releases the importer from the obligation to submit a CBAM declaration and surrender CBAM certificates in respect of those imports. In order to take into account a minor infringement or its unintentional nature, the competent authorities should be able to impose a lower penalty where the single mass-based threshold has been exceeded by no more than 10 % of that threshold or where the importer has provisionally continued to import goods and its application for the status of authorised CBAM declarant has been refused.
(33) Regulation (EU) 2023/956 applies to certain carbon-intensive goods imported into the Union. Goods listed in Annex I to Regulation (EU) 2023/956 include ‘other kaolinic clays’ in the list of cement goods. While calcined kaolinic clays are carbon-intensive products, this is not the case for non-calcined kaolinic clays. Non-calcined kaolinic clays should therefore be excluded from the scope of Regulation (EU) 2023/956.
(34) Annex II to Regulation (EU) 2023/956 lists the goods for which only direct emissions should be taken into account in the calculation of embedded emissions. For goods not listed in that Annex, both direct and indirect emissions should be taken into account. Since indirect emissions are not relevant in the case of electricity generation, electricity should be added to the list of goods in that Annex.
(35) It is necessary to simplify the means for determining default values when reliable data for the exporting country would not be available for a certain type of goods. In such cases, to prevent carbon leakage, the default value should be set at the level of the average emission intensity of the 10 exporting countries with the highest emission intensities for which reliable data is available, which is an appropriate average to ensure the environmental objective of the CBAM. This is without prejudice to the possibility to adapt these default values based on region-specific features pursuant to point 7 of Annex IV to Regulation (EU) 2023/956.
(36) In order to supplement and amend certain non-essential elements of Regulation (EU) 2023/956, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of amending the single mass-based threshold in Annex VII to that Regulation, where necessary, as determined in accordance with Article 2(3a) of that Regulation, and supplementing that Regulation in order to determine that the fees payable by authorised CBAM declarants directly finance the costs of the operation and management of the common central platform. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making(9). In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States’ experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.
(37) Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely simplifying certain obligations and strengthening the mechanism that the Union has adopted to prevent the risk of carbon leakage and thereby reduce global carbon emissions, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but can rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives;
(38) In order to allow for the timely adoption of delegated and implementing acts under Regulation (EU) 2023/956, this Regulation should enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in theOfficial Journal of the European Union.
(39) Regulation (EU) 2023/956 should therefore be amended accordingly,

Article 2

This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in theOfficial Journal of the European Union.
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.
Done at Strasbourg, 8 October 2025.",https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202502083,"The European Commission has proposed a regulation to refine and enhance the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), aiming to align carbon pricing for imported goods with those produced within the EU. This initiative seeks to reduce the administrative burden on businesses, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, by simplifying complex reporting requirements and data collection processes. The proposal maintains CBAM's environmental objectives, ensuring it continues to effectively address climate change by aligning carbon pricing for imports with internal EU standards. It also enhances the Commission's ability to monitor and supervise CBAM, improving data processing and information exchange with national authorities to maximize the utility of reported data and better detect risks.

To ease compliance, the proposal introduces a threshold to exempt certain importers from CBAM obligations, targeting those within the CBAM scope with changes to reporting requirements. This threshold considers all imported emissions over a period, applying a mass-based threshold reflecting the average emissions intensity of imported goods in specific sectors cumulatively during a calendar year. Importers established in a Member State must apply for the status of authorized CBAM declarant before importing goods into the EU.

The proposal also includes specific amendments, such as refining the classification of certain goods and adding new tables for greenhouse gas emissions related to electricity. These changes are part of a broader initiative to create a more efficient regulatory environment that supports European competitiveness and resilience. The overarching objective of the CBAM is to address climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions both within the EU and globally.

To further streamline the process, the","The European Parliament and the Council have adopted a regulation to amend the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), aiming to simplify and strengthen its implementation. The CBAM ensures that imported goods into the EU face similar carbon costs as those produced within the EU, addressing carbon emissions associated with these imports. A key change is the introduction of a ""single mass-based threshold"" of 50 tonnes, exempting smaller importers of specific goods—such as iron and steel, aluminium, fertilisers, and cement—from CBAM obligations if their imports do not exceed this limit. This exemption is designed to reduce administrative burdens while maintaining the environmental goals of the CBAM, ensuring that at least 99% of emissions from imported goods remain covered. However, this exemption does not apply to electricity and hydrogen imports due to their unique trade and emission characteristics. The regulation mandates that the Commission assesses annually whether significant changes in emission intensities or trade patterns necessitate adjustments to this threshold, ensuring that at least 99% of emissions remain within the CBAM's scope. Importers exceeding the threshold must obtain authorization as a CBAM declarant and submit declarations for the emissions embedded in their goods. Indirect customs representatives, who act on behalf of importers, must also comply with these obligations and face penalties for non-compliance, except when they have not agreed to act as authorized declarants. To prevent import disruptions, importers expecting to exceed the threshold can apply for authorization, allowing them to continue importing pending approval."

CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  a) Security of supply  The EU’s energy-security challenges are mainly linked to its primary energy supply dependence on non-EU countries. With the introduction of the European Green Deal, the EU has set out important steps it will take to reduce its dependence on imported fossil fuels by setting ambitious renewables and energy-efficiency targets. However, the 2022 energy crisis and the energy-price shock that followed highlighted the need to do more and take further steps to decrease the EU’s dependency on non-EU sources of primary energy. In particular, the REPowerEU plan sets out important steps to shield households and businesses from supply shocks by: (i) strengthening underground storage capacity of gas; (ii) upgrading and extending liquefied-natural-gas infrastructure; and (iii) diversifying both the sources and routes of pipeline gas.  To deliver on these objectives, the extension of some of the measures, mainly the November gas storage filling target, adopted previously for a limited period of time, is necessary. At the same time, market conditions have changed. With this proposal, and building upon the Commission Recommendation adopted today, the Commission aims to ensure energy security and resilience of the European union energy system while supporting Member States by providing an even higher degree of flexibility on filling trajectories to fulfil filling targets for gas storage at their own pace, reducing system stress and minimizing the room for market distortions.  b) Role of gas storage, current problems and flexibility  Gas storage contributes to security of supply by providing additional supply if there is strong demand or if supply is disrupted. Storage supplies 25-30% of gas consumed in the EU in winter. During the heating season, storage reduces the need to import additional gas and helps to absorb supply shocks.  Recognising this fact, and taking actions against both the weaponisation of Russian gas supplies and market volatility, the Commission drafted in spring 2022 – and the co-legislators quickly approved – amendments to Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 on the security of gas supply with regard to gas storage. 1 The amendments introduced a target to ensure that gas - storage facilities were 90% full by 1 November (filling target), with a series of intermediate targets for each Member State in February, May, July and September of the year thereafter (filling trajectory) . At the same time, the amendments introduced certification requirements for storage system operators (SSOs) to improve control over strategic assets and avoid the risk of there being insufficient gas in storage ahead of the winter .  As a consequence of these amendments, the dramatic 2022 scenario of price spikes in gas was not repeated in 2023 or 2024, and the obligation to certify SSOs eliminated the practice (which occurred in 2021) where some of the third-party owned gas-storage facilities were intentionally filled below capacity or late ahead of the winter months.  The European gas market remains tight. The competition for global LNG supplies has increased and exposure to price volatility is stronger than before. This is evidenced by the gas market price development during winter 2024/2025.  From the security of supply perspective, the existence of a storage filling target and filling trajectory fosters predictability and sends important signals to market players. Under this framework, actions undertaken by the EU have improved the situation since 2022. However, ultimately, the single most important objective is to strengthen the security of supply of the EU energy system in particular for the winter, which translates into the compliance of Member States with the mandatory 1 November target.  At the same time, the overall framework to meet this 1 November target must be flexible enough during the filling season to allow a swift reaction to constantly changing market conditions and in particular to take advantage of the best purchasing conditions. The purpose of intermediary filling targets, agreed upon each year by the Member States, is to ensure that the mandatory 1 November target is met. However, these targets are indicative and if necessary, can be modified in such a way that there is maximum flexibility available for market participants throughout the year. Such approach combined with better coordination among Member States, guarantees sufficient level of flexibility to fill storage at their own pace, while reducing system stress and avoiding market distortions.  The Commission will continue to closely monitor the filling of the storage facilities, and through coordination and active dialogue with the Member States, including via the Gas Coordination Group, will make sure that potential substantial and sustained deviations from the filling trajectories do not endanger security of supply and that potential risks are mitigated. In addition, the Commission will do a comprehensive assessment as part of the review of the security of supply framework to examine the added value of any permanent storage measures for security of supply post 2027.  c) Objective of the proposal  The amendments in Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 on gas storage are set to expire at the end of 2025. The continuing tight situation in the global gas-market calls for an extension of these provisions beyond 2025.  At the same time, the European Commission plans to review the EU’s energy-security framework, including by making an assessment as to whether a potential legislative proposal should incorporate permanent storage-filling measures for Member States. However, this proposal is not planned for next year.  A temporary extension of the existing gas-storage provisions is necessary to continue providing predictability and transparency in the use of gas-storage facilities across the EU.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  The gas-storage provisions in Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 were introduced through Regulation (EU) 2022/1032 for a period of three years. The provisions expire at the end of 2025. The proposal aims to extend the existing provision by a further two years on a temporary basis until a new energy-security framework is potentially put in place, most likely in the course of 2027. The extension would be consistent with the existing policy and would help to improve energy security and gas-market stability. The proposal for prolongation does not aim to alter any other aspects of the gas-storage provisions.  • Consistency with other Union policies  Following geopolitical developments, in March 2022, the Commission issued the ‘REPowerEU’ Communication for a joint European action to promote more affordable, secure and sustainable energy. Consequently, the Commission presented a legislative proposal (the Gas Storage Regulation – Regulation (EU) 2022/1032) to ensure a sufficient level of annual storage from winter 2022/2023 and into the future.  As part of a fitness check of the current energy-security framework, the Commission launched a public consultation to gather the views of a broad range of stakeholders on the benefits and possible future challenges facing Europe in the area of energy security. The public consultation, concluded at the end of November 2024, is also taking stock of the gas-storage provisions and their contribution to overall energy security.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  This proposal amends Regulation (EU) 2017/1938, the legal base of which was Article 194(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. This proposal is based on Article 194(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  The planned measures of the present initiative are fully in line with the subsidiarity principle. There is a need for an EU-level action because interruption to the EU’s gas supply: (i) poses high risks; (ii) would have significant effects on many Member States; and (iii) would affect gas prices across the EU.  • Proportionality  The initiative complies with the proportionality principle. Although the ultimate annual filling target for 1 November is laid down through the Regulation, the targets take into account the situation of individual Member States and the size of the gas-storage facilities located on their respective territories. Exemptions/derogations laid down by Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 relate to the Netherlands (Article 6a.3) and also to Austria, Czechia, Hungary, Latvia, and Slovakia (Article 6a.2). The proposed 90% filling rate is a necessary and appropriate level to ensure security of supply over the winter in the event of serious supply disruptions, without putting an excessive burden on Member States, energy companies or the public.  Intermediary filling targets are laid down on an annual basis, after consultation with the Member States (through their participation in the Gas Coordination Group). These targets allow for a sufficient level of flexibility for Member States to reflect both the existing energy situation as well as gas-market fundamentals.  • Choice of the instrument  This is a proposal to amend Regulation (EU) 2017/1938, and therefore the instrument chosen is an amending Regulation. Given that this is not a full revision of the Regulation, a recast is not considered appropriate.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  This proposal is accompanied by a report on the implementation and impact of gas-storage provisions, which concludes that both the gas-storage filling trajectories and the certification process for gas-storage facilities have had a positive impact on the security of energy supply.  The Commission submits annual reports, prepared in consultation with Member States, that include an analysis of the potential effects of the Regulation on gas prices and potential gas savings.  Additionally, as part of the fitness check of the energy-security framework, and in order to gather the views of a wide range of stakeholders, the Commission launched a public consultation. The consultation process was launched in September 2024 and lasted until November 2024. Over 100 participants provided insights and views to the consultation, including on the role of gas storage in the overall energy-security framework. Upon analysing the results of the public consultation, the Commission may conclude that a wider revision of the energy-security framework is needed and, in that context, may propose a continuation of the mandatory intermediate and ultimate annual targets for storage filling. However, the revision process is likely to last at least two years. Recognising the significant role that gas storage has played so far in boosting the energy security of Member States, a temporary prolongation of the mandatory filling target and of the intermediary targets requirement is considered necessary.  • Stakeholder consultations  As part of the public consultation related to the fitness check, stakeholders were consulted on the importance of gas storage and the utility of setting mandatory filling targets.  • Collection and use of expertise  During 2025, as part of the fitness check of the overall energy-security framework, the Commission intends to mandate an external contractor to carry out an impact assessment. The contractor would also be asked to collect external views and expertise at the same time.  • Impact assessment  As mentioned in the paragraph above, the Commission intends to carry out an impact assessment during 2025. Questions related to the gas-storage provisions will be part of the impact assessment. Due to the shortness of time remaining and the expiration of current provisions in December 2025, no impact assessment is being carried out for this temporary measure.  • Fundamental rights  The measure will enable support to be targeted at some of the most vulnerable customers, and in particular those already experiencing energy poverty.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  The impact on the EU budget associated with this proposal concerns the staffing and other administrative expenditures of the European Commission’s Directorate-General (DG) for Energy. The proposal seeks to prolong provisions improving the EU’s architecture for the security of its gas supply. These prolonged provisions would entail continued obligations for Member States and, correspondingly, a continued strengthened role for DG Energy in a wide range of areas identified in the original proposal, namely:  · o verall management and implementation of the Regulation (1 FTE) ;  · m anagement of the strengthened r ole of the Gas Coordination Group (0.5 FTE s ) ;  · m onitoring of filling rates and drawing up of technical implementation specifications , such as filling trajectories (including economic and technical analysis and data management) (1.5 FTE s ) ;  · a ssessment of the notifications on burden-sharing set out in A rticle 6c (1 FTE) ;  · a dministrative support (1 FTE).  In addition, the implementation, coordination and follow-up of this amending regulation among Member States will require additional administrative appropriations of up to EUR 150 000 a year for official trips and expert meetings, in particular meetings of the Gas Coordination Group.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  All current gas-storage-related provisions of Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 introduced by Regulation (EU) 2022/1032 would remain unchanged except the Article setting the application/validity date, which would be changed to 31 December 2027.  2025/0051 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  Amending Regulation (EU)2017/1938 as regards the role of gas storage for securing gas supplies ahead of the winter season  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 194(2) thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) Regulation (EU) 2022/1032 of the Parliament and of the Council 2 was adopted in reaction to the gas-supply crisis and unprecedented price increases caused by the escalation of the Russian military aggression against Ukraine since February 2022, impelling the Union to act in a coordinated and comprehensive manner to avoid potential risks resulting from further gas - supply disruptions .  (2) Regulation (EU) 2022/1032 amended Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 by introducing a temporary legal framework for measures regarding the filling level of underground storage facilities to strengthen the security of gas supply in the Union, in particular gas supplies to protected customers.  (3) Gas-storage facilities provide for 30% of the Union’s gas consumption during the winter months, and well-filled underground gas-storage facilities contribute substantially to the security of gas supply by providing additional gas in the event of high demand or supply disruptions.  (4) The laying down of a mandatory target to ensure that gas-storage facilities are 90% full by 1 November (filling target), with a series of intermediate targets for each Member State in February, May, July and September of the year thereafter (filling trajectory), proved to be fundamental amidst the energy crisis sparked by the weaponisation of Russian gas supplies and invasion of Ukraine in both: (i) weathering the gas-supply shortages; and (ii) reducing market uncertainties and price volatility.  (5) Despite the substantial improvement of the gas market situation compared to 2022-2023 period, the European gas market remains tight. More intense competition for global LNG supplies can increase Member States exposure to price volatility . The gas price development during the 2024/2025 winter may confirm the trend. In such situation, the role of gas storages remains paramount. Predictable filling trajectories increase transparency and prevent market distortion.  (6) Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 the obligation of the Member States to follow an annual filling trajectory and to ensure that the filling target is achieved by 1 November of each year expires on 31 December 2025.  (7) At the same time, the overall framework to meet this 1 November target must be flexible enough during the filling season to allow a swift reaction to constantly changing market conditions and in particular to take advantage of the best purchasing conditions.  (8) The purpose of intermediary filling targets, agreed upon each year by the Member States, is to ensure that the mandatory 1 November target is met. However, these targets are indicative and should allow for storage filling in such a way that there is sufficient flexibility available for market participants throughout the year in accordance with Recommendation XXX .  (9) Commission’s assessment of the current energy-security framework has confirmed the positive impact of the storage-filling requirements on the security of gas supply and those positive effects should be preserved beyond 2025.  (10) It is therefore necessary to extend by two years the relevant gas storage filling provisions that provide predictability and transparency as to the utilisation of gas-storage facilities across the Union.  (11) Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 should therefore be amended accordingly,  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Article 1  Amendment to Regulation (EU) 2017/1938  In Article 22 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1938, the fourth paragraph is replaced by the following:  “Article 2, points (27) to (31), Articles 6a to 6d, Article 16(3), Article 17a, Article 18a, Article 20(4), and Annexes Ia and Ib shall apply until 31 December 2027.”  Article2  Entry into force  This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.

of 18 July 2025
amending Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 as regards the role of gas storage for securing gas supplies ahead of the winter season
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 194(2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee(1),
After consulting the Committee of the Regions,
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure(2),
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EU) 2022/1032 of the European Parliament and of the Council(3)was adopted in reaction to the gas supply crisis and the unprecedented increases in gas prices caused by Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine since February 2022, impelling the Union to act in a coordinated and comprehensive manner to avoid potential risks resulting from further gas supply disruptions.
(2) Since the start of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, the Union aims to further advance its independence from Russian energy. This highlights the urgency to ensure alternative energy supplies from international partners via LNG or pipeline gas, without creating new dependencies. In that context, securing alternative energy supplies from reliable partners will be critical. On 17 June 2025, the Commission presented a proposal for a regulation to fully phase out Russian gas imports into the Union, which includes, in particular, an amendment to Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 of the European Parliament and of the Council(4). In addition, the Commission’s proposal includes measures allowing for the introduction of a robust and efficient system of tracking the Russian gas that crosses the Union’s border. Such measures would also help with monitoring whether the Russian gas is stored in the Union. The full phase out of Russian gas imports will allow for the reinforcement of the provisions on gas storage laid down in Regulation (EU) 2017/1938, helping the Union to have a more resilient energy system. In view of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, the Union should progress quickly towards full independence from Russian fossil fuels. Extending the measures regarding the filling level of gas storage facilities would not only contribute to the continued safeguarding of security of supply, but would also constitute a key instrument in the Union’s efforts to eliminate its dependence on imports of gas originating in Russia.
(3) Regulation (EU) 2022/1032 amended Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 by introducing a temporary legal framework for measures regarding the filling level of gas storage facilities to strengthen the security of gas supply in the Union, in particular gas supplies to protected customers.
(4) Gas-storage facilities store gas amounting to 30 % of the Union’s gas consumption during the winter months, and well-filled underground gas storage facilities as well as voluntary gas demand reduction contribute substantially to the security of gas supply by providing additional gas in the event of tight supply and demand adequacy or supply disruptions.
(5) The laying down of a binding filling target and a filling trajectory with a series of intermediate targets for each Member State in February, May, July and September to ensure that gas storage facilities are 90 % full by 1 November of a respective year, proved to be fundamental during the energy crisis sparked by Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine for the purpose of both weathering the gas supply shortages and reducing market uncertainties and price volatility.
(6) Despite the substantial improvement in the state of the gas market compared to the period 2022-2023, the European gas market remains tight and the geopolitical situation remains unclear. More intense competition for global LNG supplies can increase Member States’ exposure to price volatility. In those cases, the role of gas storage remains paramount.
(7) Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2017/1938, the obligation of the Member States to follow an annual filling trajectory and to ensure that the filling target is met by 1 November of each year expires on 31 December 2025.
(8) The changed global political environment has to be taken into account with regard to the reliability of gas suppliers and gas-supplying countries.
(9) In light of the European success in reducing the risks associated with its gas import structure, the overall framework to meet the Union’s need for gas should strike a balance between energy security and the return to market-based principles. It should therefore be flexible enough during the filling season to allow for a swift reaction to constantly changing market conditions and, in particular, to take advantage of the best purchasing conditions in order to reduce gas prices in Europe. In particular, it should be possible for Member States to meet the filling target at any point in time between 1 October and 1 December, taking into account the start of the Member States’ gas storage withdrawal period, without being required to maintain the storage level corresponding to the filling target until 1 December.
(10) The purpose of filling trajectories, set by Member States each year to represent their annual filling plan, is to ensure that the binding filling target is met within the timeframe from 1 October to 1 December in a given year. However, the filling trajectory should be indicative and should allow for storage-filling in such a way that there is sufficient flexibility available for market participants throughout the year, taking into account Commission Recommendation C(2025)1481 of 5 March 2025 on the implementation of the gas storage filling targets in 2025.
(11) In the case of difficult conditions, such as indications of trading activities hindering cost-effective storage filling, low seasonal price spread, high price environment, storage levels below the trajectory at Member State level or unforeseen technical circumstances that would make storage injection difficult and costly, limiting the ability to ensure that the gas storages are filled in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017/1938, Member States should have the possibility to deviate from the filling target by up to ten percentage points.
(12) Moreover, in the case of persistent unfavourable market conditions, such as indications of possible market manipulation, or of trading activities hindering cost-effective storage-filling, that significantly limit the ability to ensure that the gas storages are filled in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017/1938, the Commission should be empowered to further increase the level of deviation allowed by means of a delegated act. That increase should not exceed an additional five percentage points.
(13) The Commission’s assessment of the current energy security framework has confirmed the positive impact of the storage-filling requirements on the security of gas supply, and those positive effects should be preserved beyond 2025.
(14) At the same time, this Regulation should respond to current and future changes in the gas markets, contribute to the strategic objective of bringing down energy prices and facilitate the gradual return towards market-based mechanisms for storage-refilling.
(15) In order to maintain the security of supply and the appropriate level of filling of gas storage facilities, the Commission should continuously monitor the market and explore ways that could help meet the filling target, including by making more effective use of the opportunities offered by the demand aggregation and joint purchasing mechanism set up under Council Regulation (EU) 2022/2576(5).
(16) It is therefore necessary to extend until the end of 2027 the relevant gas storage-filling provisions that provide predictability and transparency as to the utilisation of gas storage facilities across the Union, while at the same time introducing some flexibility into those provisions.
(17) Considering that the relevant gas storage-filling provisions should apply as a matter of urgency before the start of the next winter season in order for Member States to meet their target in time, this Regulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication in theOfficial Journal of the European Union.
(18) In line with the principles of better regulation and simplification, and reflecting the overall improvement in the Union’s energy security framework, this Regulation should avoid introducing unnecessary administrative complexity.
(19) As outlined in the Commission communication of 26 February 2025 entitled ‘Action Plan for Affordable Energy’, the recent energy crisis, the most severe Europe has seen yet, underscored the importance of EU-level coordination in managing price spikes in the internal market. To increase resilience in the face of any possible future energy crisis, Member States need tools for effective action and the security of supply regulatory framework needs to be strengthened, incorporating the lessons learned from recent developments. Among other issues, the concept of protected customers, the prevention of the distortion of competition and the proper functioning of the internal market, as well as the role of energy sources alternative to gas such as renewable energy sources and hydrogen, together with the role of energy efficiency, in an evolving energy mix should be given due consideration.
(20) Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 should therefore be amended accordingly,

Done at Brussels, 18 July 2025.",https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202501733,"The European Commission has proposed a regulation to amend existing legislation concerning the role of gas storage in securing gas supplies ahead of the winter season. This proposal, submitted to the European Parliament, aims to extend measures initially introduced to address the 2022 energy crisis, which underscored the EU's reliance on non-EU energy sources. The proposal seeks to bolster the EU's energy security by enhancing underground gas storage capacity, upgrading liquefied natural gas infrastructure, and diversifying gas sources and routes.

A central element of the proposal is the extension of the November gas storage filling target, which mandates that gas storage facilities be 90% full by November 1st. This target, along with intermediate targets set for February, May, July, and September, is designed to ensure a stable gas supply during the winter months. The proposal also introduces flexibility for Member States to adjust their filling trajectories based on market conditions, allowing them to respond swiftly to changes and capitalize on favorable purchasing opportunities.

The proposal underscores the importance of gas storage in maintaining supply security, as it provides additional supply during periods of high demand or disruptions. Amendments introduced in 2022, including certification requirements for storage system operators, have helped prevent price spikes and ensure sufficient gas reserves. The Commission will continue to monitor storage levels and coordinate with Member States to mitigate risks and ensure compliance with the November target. The proposal also includes a commitment to review the security of supply framework post-2027 to assess the long-term value of permanent storage measures.

The","The European Parliament and the Council have adopted a regulation aimed at enhancing Europe's gas supply security, particularly before the winter season, by strengthening the role of gas storage facilities. This regulation requires gas storage facilities to reach 90% capacity by November 1st each year, with specific targets set throughout the year. Developed in response to the energy crisis and geopolitical tensions, such as Russia's war against Ukraine, the regulation seeks to reduce Europe's reliance on Russian gas. Member States must submit annual filling plans by September 15th, detailing targets for February, May, July, and September, based on the average filling rate over the past five years. In challenging market conditions, deviations from the filling target are permitted, with additional allowances if conditions persist. The regulation emphasizes monitoring market conditions and using mechanisms like demand aggregation and joint purchasing to meet targets, extending these provisions until the end of 2027. Member States without underground gas storage facilities must ensure market participants have arrangements to use storage volumes corresponding to at least 15% of their average annual gas consumption. The Commission will assess the impact of any deviations and inform the Gas Coordination Group. The regulation also includes provisions for shared responsibility between the Slovak Republic and Czechia for the Dolní Bojanovice storage facility, with details subject to a bilateral agreement. The regulation is binding and directly applicable in all Member States, entering into force the day after its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union."

CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  T he Competitiveness Compass 1 is guid ing the economic policy of the Commission in the current mandate . It b uild s on the European Council ’s Budapest Declaration 2 and the Antwerp Declaration 3 of European business and trade union representatives . The Competitiveness Compass defines a joint roadmap for decarbonisation and competitiveness as one of three transformational imperatives to boost competitiveness .  This imperative is developed in the Clean Industrial Deal 4 . It aims to strengthen the EU’s competitiveness while remaining on track to achieve climate neutrality. The focus is on supporting and creating the right conditions for companies to achieve this goal. It also aims to increase the EU’s economic and ener gy security by decreasing its dependence on imported fossil fuels and increasing the share of energy produce d from decarbonised generation with in the EU .  The Competitiveness Compass and the Clean Industrial Deal pay particular attention to the automotive sector . Th is sector is undergoing a profound and transformative shift , driven by technological changes such as digitali s ation and decarboni s ation. With this in mind , t he Commission has adopted an I ndustrial A ction P lan for the European automotive sector 5 .  These three strategies identify decarbonisation as a powerful driver of growth and put forward concrete measures to provide EU industries with a stronger business case for clean production. The action plan contains specific incentives to boost the uptake of zero-emission vehicles, including heavy-duty vehicles.  In 2022, the h eavy-duty road transport sector cause d 27. 5 % of road transport CO 2 emissions 6 despite making up only 2.4% of the vehicle fleet 7 . CO 2 emissions in th e heavy-duty road transport sector account ed for more than 6.9 % of all emissions in the EU and were 2 0 % higher than in 199 5 .  Road freight transport is a ‘hard-to-abate sector’, meaning that the cost of reducing its emissions is higher than in other economy sectors. Furthermore, the market of road freight transport services is highly competitive and is characterised by low profit margins, which constrain investment in expensive abatement technologies such as zero-emission vehicles.  I nnovation from heavy-duty vehicles manufacturers ha s in recent years led to the roll - out of zero-emission models that cover all use cases , including long-haul 8 . The ir deployment has increased substantially since 2019 9 . I n 2024 , 3.9 % of all new heavy-duty vehicles were zero-emission vehicle s 10 , including 1 . 2% of new heavy goods vehicles weighing more than 12 tonnes. However , t he share of zero-emission vehicles in the heavy-duty vehicle fleet remains extremely low 11 .  T he 2025 CO 2 reduction target for heavy-duty vehicles of 15% compared with 2019 values 12 can be achieved through efficiency improvements in conventional vehicles, but the deployment of zero-emission vehicles must rapidly increase to achieve subsequent targets 13 . However, the upfront investment for acquiring a zero-emission vehicle is approximately 2.5 time s higher than the cost of equivalent conventional vehicles 14 and remains one of the main barriers to the ir wide r deployment.  Unlike the market for passenger cars, the market for heavy-duty vehicles is a business-to-business market. Investment choices are driven by a vehicle’s cost over its entire lifetime . This is known as the total cost of ownership 15 (TCO) . The market for heavy-duty vehicles is price sensitive . This means that the purchase decision of operators when investing in a new vehicle is likely to be driven by the vehicle’s TCO . In other words, operators will have a business case to invest in a zero-emission vehicle once its cost become s lower than the cost of a conventional vehicle powered by fossil fuels.  Differentiated road charges may reduce operational costs and therefore the TCO of zero-emission vehicles. They can thus help to build a stronger business case for investing in those vehicles.  Directive (EU) 2022/362 16 enabled r oad charging 17 on the basis of CO 2 emissions. Directive (EU) 2022/362 amended Directive 1999/62/EC 18 by provid ing , among other changes , for the variation of infrastructure and user charges ( favouring the deployment of cleaner vehicles ) and/ or for the internalisation of externa l costs of CO 2 ( penalising vehicles that are more polluting ) . Both measures reduce the gap between the TCO of conventional vehicles and the TCO of zero-emission vehicles.  V ariation of road charges consists in granting a 50% to 75% reduction in infrastructure or user charges for zero-emission vehicles 19 . The external-cost charge adds the external cost for traffic-based CO 2 emissions to the infrastructure charge. The Directive provides for reference values for this charge , based on a CO 2 price of EUR 100 per tonne of CO 2 emitted 20 .  The Directive further strengthen s those two mechanisms by allowing Member States to set greatly reduced rates or even grant a full exemption for zero - emission vehicles from the infrastructure or user charge until 31 December 2025 21 . I t also allows Member State s to apply higher external-cost charge s for traffic-based CO 2 emissions up to twice the reference values of the Directive 22 .  T he monetary support in a Member State that makes full use of the se provisions to incentivise an operator to invest in a zero-emission motor vehicle that can weigh up to 40 tonnes is estimated to be as high as EUR 45 000 in the first year of operation 23 . S maller vehicles receiv e a lower level of support . For some use cases, the Directive helps to achiev e cost parity between zero-emission heavy-duty vehicles and conventional vehicles 24 .  The transposition of these provisions into national legislation was due to be completed by 25 March 2024. The option of applying significantly reduced rates to zero-emission vehicles or exempting them from infrastructure or user charges is due to end on 31 December 2025. This period is too short to sufficiently incentivise demand for new zero-emission heavy-duty vehicles.  The Commission therefore proposes to extend the applicability of this exemption. To support European manufacturers in achieving their target of reducing CO 2 emissions from new heavy-duty vehicles by 43% in the 2030 reporting period (as laid down in Regulation (EU) 2019/1242), the Commission proposes that the exemption should be extended until the end of the 2030 reporting period, which ends on 30 June 2031. This change would ensure a coherent legislative framework.  The current exemption is due to end on 31 December 2025 and national authorities would have to transpose the provisions of the currently proposed Directive into national law. The Commission is therefore inviting the European Parliament and Council to consider fast-tracking the adoption of this proposal.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  This proposal would prolong an existing provision that has been recently introduced and is therefore consistent with the existing policy framework on road charging. Where implemented, this provision had a positive impact on creating a business case for zero-emission vehicles. The exemption from infrastructure or user charges complements the application of external-cost charges because both measures reduce the gap between the operational costs and thus between the TCOs of zero-emission and conventional vehicles. Both measures are therefore important in strengthening the business case for investment in zero-emission vehicles.  • Consistency with other Union policies  Th is proposal exten ds a measure on the demand side of the market for new heavy-duty vehicles in order to accelerate their deployment . I t therefore complements the CO2 emission performance standards of the H eavy-duty V ehicles Regulation 25 , which act s on the supply side of the market for new heavy-duty vehicles, and which set s out a 43% CO2 reduction target for manufacturers by 2030 ( and subsequent higher targets until 2040 ) . Manufacturers can achieve the targets by (i) improving the efficiency of conventional vehicles ; and/or (ii) increasing the number of zero-emission vehicles that they put on the market . This proposal helps manufacturer s ramp up the deployment of zero-emission vehicles .  T he internalisation of the cost of carbon reduces the gap in the TCO between cleaner vehicles and more polluting vehicles by increas ing the operational costs of conventional vehicles . Directive 1999/62/EC internalis es the cost of carbon by imposi ng an external-cost charge. From 2027, road transport emissions will also be covered by the emission trading system in Directive 2003/87/EC ( ETS2 ) 26 . The consistency between th ose two measures will be the subject of a r eport from the Commission that will be presented by 2027, in accordance with Articles 7cb ( 4 ) and 7ga ( 8 ) of Directive 1999/62/EC. The assessment will also address the effect of energy taxation on carbon pricing , as regulated under Council Directive 2003/96/EC 27 .  R echarging infrastructure is a n enabling condition for the faster deployment of zero-emission heavy-duty vehicles. The recently revised TEN-T Regulation 28 and the Alternative Fuel s Infrastructure Regulation 29 set targets for the deployment of recharging and hydrogen refuelling stations , including specific targets for heavy-duty transport . Furthermore, t he i ndustrial a ction p lan for the EU’s automotive sector stated that the Commission will work on European Clean Transport Corridors in order to fast-track the deployment of heavy-duty vehicle charging hubs . It also stated that additional proposals will be made in the upcoming Sustainable Transport Investment Plan .  In order to reduce CO 2 emissions, it is essential to shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources . Renewable energy became the leading source of electricity production in the EU in 2023 30 . However, expanding the electricity grid infrastructure is equally important to support this transition . G rid connections are crucial for the deployment of the recharging infrastructure for heavy-duty transport . Several actions are already planned under t he EU Action Plan for Grids 31 and this will also be supplemented by the Grid Package and the Electrification Action Plan . The Commission will issue Guidance and Recommendations to the Member States on shortening the waiting time for recharging points’ connections to grids and their priority treatment and will recommend that Member States consider that charging stations and their connection to the grid are in the overriding public interest in the context of permitting procedures.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  The legal bases of Directive 1999/62/EC are Articles 91 and 113 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). This proposal pertains to the imposition of road charges on vehicles, an area to which Article 91(1) TFEU applies. The legal basis of this proposal is therefore Article 91(1) TFEU.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  The EU shares competence with Member States to regulate in the field of transport pursuant to Article 4(2)(g) TFEU, but only the EU can adapt the existing EU rules. Directive 1999/62/EC defines the cases in which reductions or exemptions from tolls and user charges may be granted. National authorities have discretion in deciding how to use those possibilities. The significantly reduced rates or exemption for zero-emission vehicles from infrastructure or user charges can only be extended beyond the end of 2025 by amending the Directive. The choice of whether to make use of this possibility or not lies with the national authorities.  • Proportionality  The proposed measures do not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the EU’s objectives of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, while also ensuring fairness and environmental integrity.  • Choice of the instrument  The legal act to be amended is a Directive, so the amending act should take the same form.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  The short time that has elapsed since the new rules had to be implemented (i.e. 25 March 2024) means that there is not sufficient information for a fully-fledged ex post evaluation of Directive (EU) 2022/362. Moreover, this proposal would merely extend a provision that already exists.  • Stakeholder consultations  While preparing this proposal, the Commission held targeted consultations with specific stakeholders, including transport operators’ and vehicle manufacturers’ associations, civil society and national authorities.  • Collection and use of expertise  The Commission has relied on publicly available information to assess both the current level of deployment of zero-emission vehicles and the effectiveness of the exemption from infrastructure or user charges. All sources used by the Commission are available in the footnotes to the text in Section 1 above.  • Impact assessment  The Commission conducted a n impact assessment accompanying the proposal which led to the adoption of Directive (EU) 2022/362 32 . The current proposal only amends the end date of an optional provision . There is therefore no need to conduct a new impact assessment .  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  This proposal would merely change a date and therefore does not have any consequences for the simplification of EU law.  • Fundamental rights  The proposal respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  The extension of the exemption from infrastructure or user charges has no implications for the EU’s budget.  The Directive ’s provision s would have different implications for national budgets depending on the Member States’ individual implementation strateg ies . R educ ing or exempti ng cleaner vehicles from road charges may negative ly impact revenues and therefore national budgets unless the average rate for other vehicles is increased 33 . Conversely, e xternal-cost charges generate revenue and positive ly impact national budgets. The Directive offers th r ee options to Member States , which may implement:  road charge reductions or exemptions in order to incentivise investment in cleaner vehicles;  external-costs charges in order to factor those external costs into the investment decisions of the private sector;  both these instruments simultaneously in order to maximise the reduction in the TCO gap between conventional vehicles and zero-emission vehicles.  In the short and medium terms (i.e. the temporal scope of this proposal ) , t he potential negative effect of road charges reductions on national budgets can be expected to be less than the positive effect of external-cost charges . The reason is that today zero-emission vehicles are still a very small part of the vehicle fleet 34 and by 2030 they are expected to be 5% to 9% of the heavy-duty vehicle fleet 35 . Accordingly , if both instruments are applied simultaneously , the revenues from external-cost charges can be expected to be greater than the foregone revenues of road charges reductions or exemptions . The use of the revenues generated by road charges (infrastructure or user charges) and by external-cost charges is regulated under Article 9(2) of Directive 1999/62/EC.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  Article 11 of Directive 1999/62/EC sets a five-yearly reporting obligation. The latest deadline was 25 March 2025, and the next deadline will be 25 March 2030. Article 11(2)(c) requires reporting on ‘ the variation of infrastructure charges or user charges according to the environmental performance of vehicles, pursuant to Article 7g, 7ga or 7gb ;’. The next deadline is before the proposed end date of the exemption and will therefore be appropriate for assessing its implementation. No additional reporting obligation is therefore planned.  • Explanatory documents (for directives)  This proposal would prolong an existing optional provision, so no explanatory document is required. Member States that use this option should nevertheless inform the Commission.  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  Article 1 amends the fifth subparagraph of Article 7ga(1) of Directive 1999/62/EC by extending the exemption laid down in that provision until 30 June 2031.  Article 2 requires Member States to immediately inform the Commission of measures taken pursuant to this Directive.  Article 3 sets the date of entry into force of the Directive.  Article 4 specifies that the Directive is addressed to the Member St ates.  2025/0188 (COD)  Proposal for a  DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Directive 1999/62/EC as regards the extension of the period in which zero-emission heavy-duty vehicles can benefit from significantly reduced rates of infrastructure or user charges or from exemptions to pay them  (Text with EEA relevance)  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 91(1) thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 36 ,  Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions 37 ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) T he registration figures of new zero-emission heavy-duty vehicles ha ve recently increased in the Union but remain too low to achieve the CO 2 emission reduction targets of the transport sector set in the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy 38 . O ne of the main barriers to wider deployment of zero-emission heavy-duty vehic les is t he high upfront cost of acquir ing such a vehicle . Securing a strong er business case for investing in zero-emission vehicles means working towards cost parity with conventional vehicles. T he total cost of ownership consist s of the upfront investment made to acquir e the vehicle and the operati onal costs incurred during the vehicle ’s lifetime . The gap of th e total cost of ownership between co n ve n tio nal and zero-emission vehicles can be reduced by lowering the operati onal costs of zero-emission vehicles . Th o se costs include road charges .  (2) Directive (EU) 2022/362 of the European Parliament and of the Council 39 amended Directive 1999/62/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 40 by, among other changes, making it possible to set road charges according to vehicles’ CO 2 emissions. It introduced the possibility to vary infrastructure and user charges and /or to internalise the externa l costs of CO 2 emissions . Both measures affect the operati onal costs of vehicles . The variation of charges decreases the operati onal costs of less-polluting vehicles , while externa l -cost charges increase the operati onal costs of more - polluting vehicles. Both measures reduce the gap in the total cost of ownership between zero-emission and conventional vehicles . Both measures are important to strengthen ing the business case for invest ing in zero-emission vehicles .  (3) Article 7ga(1), fifth subparagraph, of Directive 1999/62/EC currently gives Member States the possibility to apply reduced rates of infrastructure or user charges without putting any ceiling on such reductions, or to apply full exemption s from such charge s , only until 31 December 2025. Member States were required to transpose th at provision , introduced by Directive (EU) 2022/362 , into national law s by 25 March 2024 . T hat end date for transposition implies a very short implementation period of less than two years . Th at period is too short to meaningfully incentivise the demand of new zero-emission heavy-duty vehicles . Therefore t h at end date should be postponed in order t o create the right conditions for the wider deployment of zero-emission vehicles.  (4) The variation of road charges affects investment decisions of transport operators acquiring a new vehicle . It therefore has an effect on the demand side of the market for new heavy-duty vehicles . Heavy-duty v ehicle manufacturers constitute the supply side of the same market . They have a CO 2 emis s ions reduction target of 43% by 2030 , as set out in Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 of the European Parliament and of the Council 41 . While e fficient conventional vehicles also contribut e to the achievement of th is target, the wider deployment of zero-emission vehicles is necessary in order to achiev e it . The first year when manufacturers are to achieve th at target is the reporting period 2030, with a deadline of 30 June 2031.  (5) T o ensure a clear and coherent legal framework and to support Union companies in the automotive sector in achieving the ir CO 2 emissions reduction targets, the timing of the measures on the demand and supply side of the market of heavy-duty vehicles should be aligned . T he end date until when it is possible for Member States to apply significantly reduced rates of infrastructure or user charges or to exempt zero-emission vehicles from such charges should therefore be postponed until 30 June 2031 .  (6) T he optional nature of the amended provision means that Member States are not obliged to transpose this Directive . T hey should nevertheless immediately inform the Commission if they use the option to grant zero-emission vehicles significantly reduced rates of infrastructure and user charges or exempt ions to pay them after 31 December 2025 ,  HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:  Article 1  In of Article 7ga(1), fifth subparagraph, of Directive 1999/62/EC, the date ‘31 December 2025’ is replaced by ‘30 June 2031’, and the date ‘1 January 2026’ is replaced by ‘1 July 2031’.  Article 2  Member States shall immediately inform the Commission of measures taken pursuant to this Directive.  Article 3  This Directive shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union .

(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 91(1) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1) ,
After consulting the Committee of the Regions,
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2) ,
Whereas:
(1)  The registration figures of new zero-emission heavy-duty vehicles in the Union have recently increased but remain too low to achieve the CO 2 emission reduction targets of the transport sector set in the Commission communication of 9 December 2020 entitled ‘Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy – putting European transport on track for the future’. One of the main barriers to wider deployment of zero-emission heavy-duty vehicles is the high upfront cost of acquiring such a vehicle. Securing a stronger business case for investing in zero-emission vehicles means working towards cost parity with conventional vehicles. The total cost of ownership consists of the upfront investment made to acquire the vehicle and the operational costs incurred during the vehicle’s lifetime. The gap in the total cost of ownership between conventional and zero-emission vehicles can be reduced by lowering the operational costs of zero-emission vehicles. Those costs include road charges.
(2)  Directive (EU) 2022/362 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) amended Directive 1999/62/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) by, among other changes, making it possible to set road charges according to vehicles’ CO 2 emissions. It introduced the possibility of varying infrastructure and user charges and/or internalising the external costs of CO 2 emissions. Both measures affect the operational costs of vehicles. The variation of charges decreases the operational costs of less-polluting vehicles, while external cost charges increase the operational costs of more-polluting vehicles. Both measures reduce the gap in the total cost of ownership between zero-emission and conventional vehicles. Both measures are important for strengthening the business case for investing in zero-emission vehicles.
(3)  Article 7ga(1), fifth subparagraph, of Directive 1999/62/EC currently gives Member States the possibility of applying reduced rates of infrastructure or user charges without putting any ceiling on such reductions, or of applying full exemptions from such charges, until 31 December 2025. Member States were required to transpose Directive (EU) 2022/362 into national law by 25 March 2024. That transposition deadline implies a very short implementation period of less than two years, which is too short to meaningfully incentivise the demand of new zero-emission heavy-duty vehicles. The implementation period should therefore be extended in order to create the right conditions for the wider deployment of zero-emission vehicles.
(4)  The variation of road charges affects investment decisions of transport operators acquiring a new vehicle. It therefore has an effect on the demand side of the market for new heavy-duty vehicles. Heavy-duty vehicle manufacturers constitute the supply side of the same market. They have a CO 2 emissions reduction target of 43 % by 2030, as set out in Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5) . While efficient conventional vehicles also contribute to the achievement of that target, the wider deployment of zero-emission vehicles is necessary in order to achieve it. The first year when manufacturers are to achieve that target is the reporting period 2030, with a deadline of 30 June 2031.
(5)  To ensure a clear and coherent legal framework and to support Union companies in the automotive sector in achieving their reduction targets for CO 2 emissions, the timing of the measures on the demand and supply side of the market of heavy-duty vehicles should be aligned. The date until which it is possible for Member States to apply significantly reduced rates of infrastructure or user charges or to exempt zero-emission vehicles from such charges should therefore be postponed to 30 June 2031.
(6)  The optional nature of the amended provision means that Member States are not obliged to transpose this Directive. They should nevertheless immediately inform the Commission if they use the option to grant zero-emission vehicles significantly reduced rates of infrastructure and user charges or exemptions to pay them after 31 December 2025,

Done at Strasbourg, 26 November 2025.",https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202502459,"The European Commission has proposed a directive aimed at extending the period during which zero-emission heavy-duty vehicles, such as trucks and buses, can benefit from reduced road charges or exemptions. This initiative is part of the EU's broader strategy to promote cleaner technologies and reduce reliance on fossil fuels, with the ultimate goal of achieving climate neutrality. The heavy-duty road transport sector, a significant contributor to CO2 emissions, faces challenges in reducing emissions due to its competitive market and low profit margins, which limit investment in zero-emission vehicles.

To address the high upfront costs associated with zero-emission vehicles, the proposal offers reduced infrastructure or user charges, thereby lowering the total cost of ownership and making these vehicles more attractive to operators. This approach is intended to accelerate the adoption of zero-emission vehicles, which is crucial for meeting future CO2 reduction targets. The directive builds on existing legislation that allows for differentiated road charges based on CO2 emissions, further incentivizing the shift towards cleaner vehicles by reducing operational costs.

Member States are permitted to apply higher external-cost charges for traffic-based CO2 emissions, potentially providing up to EUR 45,000 in monetary support in the first year of operation for zero-emission vehicles weighing up to 40 tonnes. This support varies for smaller vehicles and aims to achieve cost parity between zero-emission and conventional vehicles in some cases. The current exemption from reduced rates or charges is set to end on December 31, 2025, but the Commission proposes extending this until June 30","The European Parliament and the Council have adopted a directive to extend the period during which zero-emission heavy-duty vehicles can benefit from reduced road charges or exemptions in the EU. This move aims to encourage the adoption of zero-emission vehicles by addressing the high upfront costs and operational expenses that currently hinder their widespread use. The directive amends existing legislation to allow member states to offer these financial incentives until June 30, 2031, instead of the previous deadline of December 31, 2025. This extension is intended to better align with the CO2 emissions reduction targets set for the transport sector, providing a more favorable business case for investing in zero-emission vehicles. While member states are not obligated to implement these changes, they are required to inform the Commission if they choose to continue offering these incentives beyond the original deadline. This directive is part of broader efforts to promote sustainable and smart mobility within the EU."

EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 as regards obligations of economic operators concerning battery due diligence policies  (Text with EEA relevance)  EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM  1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 ( 1 ) aims to contribute to the efficient functioning of the internal market, while preventing and reducing the adverse impacts of batteries on the environment . It also aims to protect the environment and human health by preventing and reducing the adverse impacts of the generation and management of waste batteries. It imposes a mong other thing s battery due diligence obligations on economic operators placing batteries on the market or putting them into service. These obligations are to be applied from 18 August 2025.  Battery raw material supply chains are affected by a shifting geopolitical landscape. This leaves the battery industry with many challenges in particular related to sourcing raw materials. It takes time to analyse and adjust supply chains.  Furthermore, one of the battery due diligence obligations is that economic operators’ battery due diligence policies are verified by a notified body (‘third-party verification’). Only about half of the Member States have appointed their notifying authority in charge of the assessment, notification and monitoring of conformity assessment bodies. In many cases such applications would be based on accreditation, but the European co-operation for Accreditation association has not been able to determine a standard for the accreditation of notified bodies for battery due diligence. It instead indicated that this should rely on schemes approved by the European Commission.  Due diligence schemes being developed by industry associations and groupings of interested organisations are expected to play an important role in the implementation of the battery due diligence obligations. The provisions on such schemes in Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 mirror those of Regulation (EU) 2017/821, for which several schemes are being assessed for recognition, but no scheme has been recognised to date. Schemes that address battery raw materials still need to be further developed and implemented and then go through the recognition process for schemes under Regulation (EU) 2023/1542.  In addition , Article 94(4) of Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 requires the Commission to assess , one year after the Directive (EU) 2024/1760 on corporate sustainability due diligence ( 2 ) was adopted , whether amendments to the battery due diligence obligations are necessary in light of the adoption of that Directive . While it is too early for such an assessment, especially because the Commission proposed amendments to Directive (EU) 2024/1760 on 26 February 2025 , consistency in implementation could be improved by developing the guidelines for both pieces of legislation hand in hand , if the application date s allow to do so .  For these reasons, the Commission considers that the date of application of the battery due diligence obligations specified in Article 48(1) of Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 should be postponed by two years to allow economic operators placing batteries on the EU market to be better prepared, with the help of guidelines, and to allow time to resolve difficulties with the availability of notified bodies.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  The adoption of Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 was an integral part of the European Green Deal and is coherent with its overall objectives and all the initiatives developed under it. This proposal does not amend any substantive rules of Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 but merely aims to accord additional time for economic operators placing batteries on the EU market to be better prepared and to resolve difficulties with the availability of notified bodies.  • Consistency with other Union policies  Directive (EU) 2024/1760 on corporate sustainability due diligence lays down rules and obligations to ensure that companies identify and address potential and actual adverse human rights and environmental impacts in the company’s own operations, their subsidiaries and, when related to their chains of activities, those of their business partners.  Directive (EU) 2024/1760 was adopted after the adoption of Regulation (EU) 2023/1542. It specifies that the Directive is ‘without prejudice to obligations in the areas of human, employment and social rights, and of protection of the environment and climate change under other Union legislative acts’, and that ‘if a provision of this Directive conflicts with a provision of another Union legislative act pursuing the same objectives and providing for more extensive or more specific obligations, the provision of that other Union legislative act shall prevail to the extent of the conflict and shall apply as regards those specific obligations.’ This is the case for the more specific requirements of the battery due diligence policy in Regulation (EU) 2023/1542. Operators in the battery supply chain must therefore apply the battery due diligence policy of Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 insofar as they are more extensive or more specific, instead of the equivalent provisions in Directive (EU) 2024/1760 for the supply chain stages and the minerals specified. For other operations, operators in scope of both legislative acts must follow the rules of Directive (EU) 2024/1760.  There are some elements where the due diligence obligations of Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 are not harmonious with the provisions of Directive (EU) 2024/1760. This is because Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 is product-specific and Directive (EU) 2024/1760 is cross-sectorial.  This proposal addresses consistency to the extent possible by harmonising the publication dates for guidelines under both pieces of legislation so they can be developed hand in hand.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  Due diligence obligations on economic operators placing batteries on the market or putting them into service should prevent and reduce adverse impacts of batteries on the environment and ensure a sustainable battery value chain. Such measures will help to ensure the transition to a circular economy and the long-term competitiveness of the EU. They should also contribute to the efficient functioning of the internal market, while taking into account a high level of protection of the environment. To prevent divergences hampering the free circulation of batteries Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be used as a legal basis of the proposal.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  This initiative is consistent with the principle of subsidiarity. Given the need to modify Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 by postponing the application of its due diligence obligations, the objectives of this initiative cannot be achieved by the Member States themselves.  • Proportionality  The proposal is consistent with the principle of proportionality, i.e. it does not go beyond what is necessary to meet the objectives of the Treaties and in particular the smooth functioning of the internal market. As with the subsidiarity test, it is not possible for Member States to address the issues without a proposal to amend the date of application of the due diligence obligations of Regulation (EU) 2023/1542.  • Choice of the instrument  The proposal amends Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 concerning batteries and waste batteries only as regards the postponement of the date of application. It should therefore follow the same type of act, i.e. a regulation.  3. RESULTS OF EX POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  Not applicable.  • Stakeholder consultations  Not applicable.  • Collection and use of expertise  Not applicable.  • Impact assessment  Not applicable.  An impact assessment was carried out for the proposal, which led to the adoption of Regulation (EU) 2023/1542. The current proposal only amends the date of application of the due diligence obligations of Regulation (EU) 2023/1542.  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  The main goal of this proposal is to postpone the date of application of the due diligence obligations of Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 by two years to allow economic operators placing batteries on the EU market to be better prepared, with the help of guidelines, and resolve difficulties with third-party verification.  The proposal does not change the substance of the rules, it only postpones their date of application.  • Fundamental rights  Not applicable.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  Not applicable.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  Not applicable.  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  Not applicable.  2025/0129 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 as regards obligations of economic operators concerning battery due diligence policies  (Text with EEA relevance)  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee ( 3 ) ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 4 ) sets out battery due diligence obligations that cover the sourcing, processing and trading of cobalt, natural graphite, lithium and nickel used for battery manufacturing. Those due diligence obligations are to be applied from 18 August 2025.  (2) At a time when the geopolitical landscape continues to shift , v arious challenges need to be overcome , including in sourcing of raw materials. Battery manufacturers need time to analyse and , where necessary, adjust their supply chains as a result .  (3) The battery due diligence obligations include requirements for third-party verification by notified bodies . However, t he designation of notified bodies for battery due diligence policies is taking longer than expected. Due diligence s chemes recognised by the Commission in accordance with Article 53 of Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 would facilitate the work of economic operators and of notified bodies. However, due diligence s chemes addressing battery raw materials still need to be further developed and implemented, and then go through the recognition process.  (4) In order to provide sufficient time for the notification of conformity assessment bodies and to allow economic operators placing batteries on the market to be in a position to comply with their obligations, t he date of application of the battery due diligence policies set out in Regulation (EU) 2023/1542, should be postponed by two years.  (5) Directive (EU) 2024/1760 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 5 ) lays down rules and obligations to ensure that companies identify and address potential and actual adverse human rights and environmental impacts in the company’s own operations, the operations of their subsidiaries and, where related to their chain s of activities , the operations of their business partners.  (6) Th e Commission is to publish , in accordance with Article 48(5) Article of Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 , guidelines as regards the application of the due battery diligence requirements . The Commission is to make available , in accordance with Article 19(2), point (a) of Directive (EU) 2024/1760, guidelines as regards guidance and best practices on how to conduct due diligence . Consistency between Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 and Directive (EU) 2024/1760 is important for companies in the battery supply chain . Therefore, the relevant dates for the publication and making available of those guidelines should be harmonised .  (7) Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 should t herefore be amended accordingly .  (8) This Regulation should enter into force as a matter of urgency on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union and it should apply from 18 August 2025 in order to provide legal certainty with regard to the date of application of the due diligence obligations under Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 ,  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Article 1  Amendments to Regulation (EU) 2023/1542  Article 48 of Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 is amended as follows:  in paragraph 1, ‘18 August 2025’ is replaced by ‘18 August 2027’;  in paragraph 5, ‘18 February 2025’ is replaced by ‘26 July 2026’.  Article 2  Entry into force  This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union .  It shall apply from 18 August 2025.  This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.

Title of the proposal/initiative  Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 as regards obligations of economic operators concerning battery due diligence policies  1.2. Policy area(s) concerned  Policy area: 03 Single Market , 03 02 01 01 – Operation and development of the internal market of goods and services  1.3. Objective(s)  1.3.1. General objective(s)  Reducing environmental and social impacts through responsible sourcing.  1.3.2. Specific objective(s)  Ensure that the battery due diligence provisions of Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 can be properly implemented by economic operators, including third party verification.  1.3.3. Expected result(s) and impact  Specify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.  Companies have more time to prepare for the implementation of due diligence obligations, including third party verification. It also allows the Commission, at the level of guidance, to address coherence in implementation with the provisions of Directive (EU) 2024/1760.  1.3.4. Indicators of performance  Specify the indicators for monitoring progress and achievements.  The indicators for Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 remain the same.  1.4. The proposal/initiative relates to:  ☐ a new action  ☐ a new action following a pilot project/preparatory action ( 6 )   the extension of an existing action  ☐ a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action  1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative  1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative  The obligations remain the same as for Regulation (EU) 2023/1542, but the timeline shifts.  1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, greater effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this section 'added value of EU involvement' is the value resulting from EU action, that is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.  Given the need to modify Regulation (EU) 2023/1542, the objectives of this initiative cannot be achieved by the Member States themselves. The EU added value remains the same.  1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past  The due diligence provisions of Regulation (EU) 2023/1115 were also postponed. This was successfully done within three months of the Commission proposal.  1.5.4. Compatibility with the multiannual financial framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments  There is no impact on the multiannual financial framework.  1.5.5. Assessment of the different available financing options, including scope for redeployment  No financing or redeployment is necessary.  1.6. Duration of the proposal/initiative and of its financial impact   limited duration   in effect from 18 / 08/2025 to 18/08/2027  ☐ financial impact from YYYY to YYYY for commitment appropriations and from YYYY to YYYY for payment appropriations.  ☐ unlimited duration  Implementation with a start-up period from YYYY to YYYY,  followed by full-scale operation.  1.7. Method(s) of budget implementation planned ( 7 )   Direct management by the Commission   by its departments, including by its staff in the Union delegations;  ☐ by the executive agencies  ☐ Shared management with the Member States  ☐ Indirect management by entrusting budget implementation tasks to:  ☐ third countries or the bodies they have designated;  ☐ international organisations and their agencies (to be specified);  ☐ the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund;  ☐ bodies referred to in Articles 70 and 71 of the Financial Regulation;  ☐ public law bodies;  ☐ bodies governed by private law with a public service mission to the extent that they are provided with adequate financial guarantees;  ☐ bodies governed by the private law of a Member State that are entrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership and that are provided with adequate financial guarantees;  ☐ bodies or persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in the common foreign and security policy pursuant to Title V of the Treaty on European Union, and identified in the relevant basic act  ☐ bodies established in a Member State, governed by the private law of a Member State or Union law and eligible to be entrusted, in accordance with sector-specific rules, with the implementation of Union funds or budgetary guarantees, to the extent that such bodies are controlled by public law bodies or by bodies governed by private law with a public service mission, and are provided with adequate financial guarantees in the form of joint and several liability by the controlling bodies or equivalent financial guarantees and which may be, for each action, limited to the maximum amount of the Union support.  2. MANAGEMENT MEASURES  2.1. Monitoring and reporting rules  N/A - No financing or redeployment is necessary.  2.2. Management and control system(s)  2.2.1. Justification of the budget implementation method(s), the funding implementation mechanism(s), the payment modalities and the control strategy proposed  N/A  2.2.2.

(As an agreement was reached between Parliament and Council, Parliament's position corresponds to the final legislative act, Regulation (EU) 2025/1561.)",,,,,,,,"REGULATION (EU) 2025/1561 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL
of 18 July 2025
amending Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 as regards obligations of economic operators concerning battery due diligence policies
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee(1),
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure(2),
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 of the European Parliament and of the Council(3)imposes battery due diligence obligations on economic operators that cover the sourcing, processing and trading of cobalt, natural graphite, lithium and nickel used for battery manufacturing. Those due diligence obligations are to be applied from 18 August 2025.
(2) At a time when the geopolitical landscape continues to shift, various challenges need to be overcome, including as regards sourcing of raw materials. As a result, battery manufacturers need time to analyse and, where necessary, adjust their supply chains.
(3) The battery due diligence obligations laid down in Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 include requirements covering third-party verification by notified bodies. However, the designation of such notified bodies is taking longer than expected. Due diligence schemes recognised by the Commission in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 would facilitate the work of economic operators and of notified bodies. However, due diligence schemes addressing raw materials present in batteries still need to be further developed and implemented, and subsequently go through the process of recognition of their equivalence by the Commission.
(4) In order to provide sufficient time for the notification of conformity assessment bodies and to allow economic operators placing batteries on the market to be in a position to comply with their obligations, the date of application of the battery due diligence obligations laid down in Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 should be postponed by two years.
(5) Directive (EU) 2024/1760 of the European Parliament and of the Council(4)lays down rules and obligations to ensure that companies identify and address actual and potential adverse human rights and environmental impacts in the company’s own operations, the operations of their subsidiaries and, where related to their chains of activities, the operations of their business partners.
(6) The Commission is to publish, in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2023/1542, guidelines as regards the application of the battery due diligence requirements. Furthermore, the Commission is to make available, in accordance with Directive (EU) 2024/1760, guidelines as regards guidance and best practices on how to conduct due diligence. Since consistency between Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 and Directive (EU) 2024/1760 is important for companies in the battery supply chain, the respective dates for the publication and making available of those guidelines should be harmonised.
(7) Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely to contribute to the efficient functioning of the internal market, while preventing and reducing the adverse impacts of batteries and waste batteries on the environment and ensure a high level of protection of human health, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of scale or effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
(8) Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(9) In view of the urgency of the matter and to provide legal certainty as soon as possible, it is considered to be appropriate to invoke the exception to the eight-week period provided for in Article 4 of Protocol No 1 on the role of national Parliaments in the European Union, annexed to the Treaty on European Union, to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community.
(10) This Regulation should enter into force as a matter of urgency on the day following that of its publication in theOfficial Journal of the European Union,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

Article 1

Article 48 of Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 is amended as follows:
(a) in paragraph 1, the date ‘18 August 2025’ is replaced by ‘18 August 2027’;
(b) in paragraph 5, the date ‘18 February 2025’ is replaced by ‘26 July 2026’.

Article 2

This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in theOfficial Journal of the European Union.
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.
Done at Brussels, 18 July 2025.",https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202501561,"The European Commission has proposed an amendment to existing legislation concerning the obligations of economic operators in the battery industry, focusing on enhancing due diligence policies. This proposal addresses challenges such as the complexities of sourcing raw materials and the need for third-party verification of due diligence policies. Initially, companies placing batteries on the market were required to adhere to specific environmental and health standards, verified by accredited bodies. However, many member states have not yet appointed the necessary authorities to oversee this process, and there is no established standard for accrediting these bodies.

To address these issues, the Commission suggests postponing the application date of these obligations by two years. This delay is intended to give companies more time to prepare and to resolve the current difficulties with the availability of accredited bodies. The proposal aligns with the European Green Deal's objectives and seeks to provide additional time for compliance without altering the substantive rules of the original regulation. It also considers the recent Directive on corporate sustainability due diligence, ensuring that the more specific requirements of the battery regulation take precedence where applicable. This approach aims to harmonize the obligations under both the battery regulation and the broader corporate sustainability directive.

The proposal also addresses consistency by harmonizing the publication dates for guidelines under both pieces of legislation, allowing them to be developed concurrently. The legal basis for this initiative is to prevent divergences that could hamper the free circulation of batteries within the EU. The Commission is tasked with publishing guidelines on the application of due diligence requirements and making available guidance and best practices.

In terms","The European Parliament and the Council have adopted a regulation amending existing legislation concerning the due diligence obligations of economic operators in the battery supply chain. This amendment extends the deadline for compliance with these obligations from August 18, 2025, to August 18, 2027, providing additional time for battery manufacturers to adjust their supply chains amid challenges in sourcing raw materials like cobalt, natural graphite, lithium, and nickel. The regulation also addresses the need for third-party verification by notified bodies, whose designation has been delayed, and emphasizes the importance of aligning guidelines with related human rights and environmental directives.

CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  As seen in the recent unprecedented cyclone in Mayotte, natural disasters and severe meteorological events in the outermost regions of the E U are having a devastating effect on the populations living and working in these regions. Much of the agricultural and forestry production potential is destroyed every year , causing huge losses of income and threatening the food availability and security of these regions which already fac e permanent constraints on their development , as recognised in Article 349 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. In fact, wh ile these regions are quite different from one another, they share some specificities, such as remoteness, insularity 1 , mostly small size, increased vulnerability to climate change, economies dependent on a few sectors, with high levels of unemployment , and gross domestic product (GDP) significantly below EU and national averages . All these constraints render the recovery of the agricultural production destroyed by severe natural disasters even more difficult and the severity of the natural disasters render the time of recovery even longer .  In its Communication “ Putting people first, securing sustainable and inclusive growth, unlocking the potential of the EU’s outermost regions” 2 , the Commission committed to reflecting the outermost regions’ specificities across all EU policies, including agriculture 3 . Some of the challenges of the agricultural sector in the outermost regions are already addressed in a specific way through Regulation (EU) No 228/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council 4 . H owever, in the face of ever more severe natural disasters in these regions, the need for further flexibilities was identified. In order to address the cash-flow challenges during the reconstruction of agricultural production after the frequent devastating natural disasters in outermost regions , Europe needs to be able to rapidly deploy effective support and more flexibility through the POSEI referred to in that Regulation . This involves programme s of options specifically relating to remoteness and insularity laying down specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of the Union by ensuring continuity of POSEI support to the beneficiaries during the restoration period, irrespective of the level of their activity, but subject to formal commitment s to restore their capacity . On 14 December 2024, the outermost region of Mayotte was hit by th e deadly cyclone Chido , causing widespread destruction and casualties everywhere in its path, devastat ing thousands of homes and cut ting off the water and electricity supplies . Roads, communications networks and health infrastructures were seriously affected or put out of service . O n 11 January 2025 , Mayotte was also struck by the tropical storm Dikeledi , with heavy rain and local flooding compounding the damage caused by Chido . The effects of Chido on agriculture and f ood s ecurity were significant: strong winds destroyed crops in many area s, f armlands were flooded , disrupt ing planting schedules, which will lead to lower yields for the next growing season . In addition, Chido d est royed infrastructure, such as roads, hamper ing the transportation of agricultural goods . For the first time , France declared a state of exceptional natural disaster.  Consequently, the last year of the implementation of the Rural Development Programme in Mayotte for the programming period 2014-2022 (RDP Mayotte) was heavily affected. Many projects, in particular investments, will be delayed or abandoned. In addition, in the first instance, farmers and other actors in agriculture need liquidity support to be able to make a living until the restoration of their holdings has occurred, as well as the restoration of their production potential.  Regulation (EU) 2024/3242 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 December 2024 5 amending Regulation (EU) 2020/2220 of the European Parliament and of the Council 6 introduced a new exceptional and temporary measure ( inserted in Article 6a of Regulation (EU) 2020/2220 ) which allows Member States to provide liquidity support to farmers, forest holders, as well as SMEs active in processing agricultural and forestry products , affected by natural disasters occurring as of 1 January 2024.  Pursuant to the current rules, an upper ceiling of maximum 10% of EAFRD funds for 2021-2022 (excluding EURI) can be allocated to this measure (1.5 M€ for Mayotte). To provide an adequate response to the exceptional natural disasters occurred in Mayotte, it is proposed to remove this ceiling of 10% and allow Mayotte to reallocate 2021-2022 EAFRD funds for the support provided under measure pursuant to Article 6a of Regulation (EU) 2020/2220.  In the context of this measure, the deadline for the approval of the applications is set to 30/06/2025 7 in order to provide swift reaction to natural disasters and quick liquidity to those in need . However, given that this proposal will change the conditions of this measure for Mayotte, it is necessary t o provide sufficient time to the Managing authority of Mayotte to select the beneficiaries once this regulation enters into force . For this reason, the deadline for approval of the applications should not apply. Nonetheless, the eligibility of expenses (31 December 2025) as defined in Regulation (UE) 130 3 /2013 8 remains unchanged. This means that the payments to the beneficiaries have to be made by 31 December 2025.  Further, the Commission proposes to introduce a derogation to capping of measure pursuant to Article 6a of Regulation (EU) 2020/2220 for Mayotte, which will allow the outermost region to effectively address the liquidity needs of the rural population heavily damaged in the described natural disasters. This derogation should be done through specific provisions of POSEI Regulation in order to keep this derogation limited to the specific needs of the outermost region of Mayotte.  Therefore, in order to provide the above-described additional assistance and further flexibility to outermost regions affected by natural disasters, the Commission proposes a targeted modification of the POSEI Regulation which lays down specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of the Union.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  The proposal is consistent with the overall legal framework established for the Common Agricultural Policy and the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) and is limited to a targeted amendment of Regulation (EU) No 228/2013.  • Consistency with other Union policies  The proposal is limited to targeted amendments of Regulation (EU) No 228/2013 and maintains consistency with other Union policies.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  The proposal is based on Articles 42, 43(2) and 349 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union provides that the competence for agriculture is shared between the Union and the Member States, while establishing a common agricultural policy with common objectives and a common implementation. The proposal aims at ensuring further flexibilities to Outermost regions affected by natural disasters or severe meteorological events.  • Proportionality  The proposal comprises limited and targeted amendments that do not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objective of providing exceptional and temporary relief to farmers, forest holders, SMEs and holdings active in processing, marketing or development of agricultural products or forestry products and for restoration efforts, who are particularly affected by natural disasters.  • Choice of the instrument  A Regulation is the appropriate instrument to introduce the flexibility needed to address these unprecedented circumstances.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  N/A  • Stakeholder consultations  Due to the technical, limited and urgent nature of the proposed modifications, the wide public consultation is not required.  • Collection and use of expertise  N/A  • Impact assessment  Due to the technical nature and targeted scope of the initiative, the impact assessment is not required.  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  N/A  • Fundamental rights  N/A  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  This new proposal does not imply any changes in the Multiannual Financial Framework annual ceilings for commitments and payments as per Annex I of Regulation (EU) No 2020/2093. The annual breakdown of commitment appropriations for the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development E.08030102 remains unchanged.  Overall, this measure does not imply the need for extra payment appropriations. The necessary payment appropriations of EUR 13.5 million in 2025 and 2026 payment appropriations are foreseen to be offset by decommitments at closure expected to take place in 2026. Funds allocated to other Rural Development Programmes (RPDs) that will remain unused will be decommitted and will compensate for the additional costs under this amendment.  As regards POSEI support, this proposal does not have any quantifiable budgetary impact. Any related expenditure will remain under the annual Member State financial allocation for POSEI.  .5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation, and reporting arrangements  The implementation of the measures will be monitored and reported upon in the framework of the reporting mechanisms established in Regulations (EU) No 1303/2013 , (EU) No 1305/2013 9 and (EU) 228/2013.  • Explanatory documents (for directives)  N/A  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  In order to provide further flexibilities to the outermost regions affected by natural disasters and severe meteorological events and to provide an adequate response to the impact of the unprecedented natural disaster Chido in Mayotte on the farmers, other EAFRD beneficiaries and the administrations it is proposed to amend Regulation (EU) No 228/2013 as follows:  · Allow the competent national authorities to submit an exceptional programme modification to their POSEI programme while they apply the principle of force majeure or exceptional circumstances where, as a result of the unexpected severe natural disaster, the agricultural production capacity was seriously or totally destroyed, and the restoration of certain sectors requires a longer period than could be covered by the application of the principle of force majeure or exceptional circumstances. This would allow the beneficiaries concerned to continue to receive POSEI support during the restoration period, irrespective of the level of their activity, but subject to their formal commitment to restore their agricultural production capacity . The implementation of this programme modification will be subject to annual review and monitoring of progress in close cooperation between the Commission and the Member State.  · For the rural development programme of Mayotte, r emove the limit of 10% of the 2021 and 2022 budgetary allocations for temporary support in response to the impact of natural disasters to be funded under the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and allow the s election of the beneficiaries beyond the deadline of 30 June 2025.  · Compliance with the digital-by-default principle  · According to the digital assessment carried out, the current proposal has no digital dimensions as there is no digital relevance. Digital means or data exchange are not under the scope of the proposal.  2025/0104 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulation (EU) No 228/2013 as regards additional assistance and further flexibility to outermost regions affected by severe natural disasters and in the context of cyclone Chido devastating Mayotte  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 42, Article 43(2) and Article 349 thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 10 ,  Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions 11 ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) On 18 December 2024 , an “exceptional natural disaster” was declared for the outermost region of Mayotte following the devastating consequences of c yclone Chido , that d estroyed much of the agricultural and forestry potential of the island and threatened food availability and security . Th is unprecedented cyclone and other recent natural disasters in the outermost regions of the Union as de scribed in Article 349 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) , demonstrate the vulnerability of the se regions to the effects of climate change, including the increased risk of exceptional natural disasters or severe meteorological events with long-term consequence s .  (2) I n order to address and mi tigate the impact of exceptional natural disasters or severe meteorological events in the outermost regions of the Union , in particular as regard s the support to local production provided through the Programme of Options Specifically Relating to Remoteness and Insularity (POSEI) referred to in Regulation (EU) No 228/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council 12 ; it is appropriate to provide for the possibility for the affected beneficiaries to continue to receive POSEI payments during the restoration period irrespective of the level of their activity, subject to a formal commitment to restore their capacity . It should therefore be provided for that t he competent national authorities may decide on the application of force majeure or exceptional circumstances on the basis of relevant evidence. At the same time, in duly justified circumstances, where the restoration of certain sectors requires a longer period, it should be provided for that an exceptional programme amendment, subject to annual review and monitoring of progress, may extend this restoration period beyond what could be covered by the application of the principle of force majeure or exceptional circumstances. For this purpose, Articles 6 and 19 of Regulation (EU) No 228/2013 should be amended.  (3) I n addition , in order to quickly address the vulnerabilities of Mayotte’s food system and rural communities resulting from that unprecedented natural disaster caused by cyclone Chido ; it is appropriate to rapidly provide exceptional effective support through the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development ( EAFRD ) , and to provide for more flexibility in the existing rules. Article 6a of Regulation (EU) 2020/2220 of the European Parliament and of the Council 13 introduced a new measure providing exceptional temporary support in response to the impact of natural disasters to be funded under the EAFRD within the legal framework applicable in the programming period 2014-2020, as extended by that Regulation. In order to allow Mayotte to respond to the consequences of cyclone Chido and taking into account the difficulties caused by the specific situation of this o utermost region , the application of the measure introduced by Article 6a of Regulation (EU) 2020/2220 in Mayotte sh ou l d be established. As the specific difficulties of responding to the exceptional situation in Mayotte are linked to its remoteness as an outermost region as described in Article 349 TFEU , it is appropriate to provide for the flexibilities of the EAFRD support through the establishment of a specific legal framework for the additional support of the outermost regions. For this purpose, Article 22 of Regulation (EU) No 228/2013 should be amended.  (4) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely to address and mitigate the impact of natural disasters on the agri-food and forestry sectors in the outermost regions by providing additional flexibilities after exceptional natural disasters or severe meteorological events and in particular, after c yclone Chido in Mayotte , cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but can rather be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.  (5) Regulation (EU) No 228/2013 should therefore be amended accordingly.  (6) In view of the devasting effects of the current natural disasters and the urgency of addressing and mitigating their impact on the agri-food and forestry sectors in outermost regions , as well as the urgency in applying the measure pursuant to Article 6a of Regulation (EU) 2020/2220 before the end of the programming period 2014-202 0 , as extended by Regulation (EU) 2020/2220 it is considered to be appropriate to invoke the exception to the eight- week period provided for in Article 4 of Protocol No 1 on the role of national Parliaments in the European Union, annexed to the TEU, to the T FEU and to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community .  (7) In order to ensure a smooth implementation of these amendments and as a matter of urgency in view of the pressing need to address and mitigate the impact of exceptional natural disasters or severe meteorological events in the outermost territories of the Union , and in particular, that of c yclone Chido in Mayotte , this Regulation should enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union ,  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Article 1  Regulation (EU) No 228/2013 is amended as follows:  (1) in Article 6, the following paragraph 5 is added:  ‘5. In the event of exceptional natural disasters or severe meteorological events which destroy totally or partially the agricultural production capacity in an outermost region, Member States may submit a proposal to amend the programme, while applying the principle of force majeure or exceptional circumstances in order to allow the beneficiaries concerned to continue to receive POSEI support throughout the restoration period in the form of measures to assist local agricultural production provided for in Article 19. The implementation of these programme modifications shall be subject to an annual review and monitoring of progress in close cooperation between the Commission and the Member State.’;  (2) in Article 19, the following paragraph 5 is added:  ‘5. When a programme is amended in accordance with Article 6(5), beneficiaries affected by the exceptional natural disaster or the severe meteorological event may continue to benefit from support in the form of measures to support production, processing or sale provided for in paragraph 4 of this Article irrespective of their level of activity throughout the restoration period, but subject to a formal commitment to restore their agricultural production capacity.’;  (3) in Article 22, the following paragraphs 3 and 4 are added:  ‘3. By way of derogation from Article 6a (5) of Regulation (EU) 2020/2220 of the European Parliament and of the Council*, Mayotte may approve applications for support after 30 June 2025.  4. In the rural development programme of Mayotte, the EAFRD support provided for the measure referred to in Article 6a of Regulation (EU) 2020/2220 shall not exceed the total EAFRD contribution to that rural development programme for the years 2021–2022.  * Regulation (EU) 2020/2220 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 December 2020 laying down certain transitional provisions for support from the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and from the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) in the years 2021 and 2022 and amending Regulations (EU) No 1305/2013, (EU) No 1306/2013 and (EU) No 1307/2013 as regards resources and application in the years 2021 and 2022 and Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 as regards resources and the distribution of such support in respect of the years 2021 and 2022 (OJ L 437, 28.12.2020, p. 1, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2020/2220/oj ). ’ .

of 24 June 2025
amending Regulation (EU) No 228/2013 as regards additional assistance to, and further flexibility in respect of, outermost regions affected by severe natural disasters and in the context of the devastation caused by cyclone Chido in Mayotte
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 42, Article 43(2) and Article 349 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee(1),
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure(2),
Whereas:
(1) On 18 December 2024, an exceptional natural disaster was declared for Mayotte following the devastating consequences of cyclone Chido, which destroyed much of the agricultural and forestry potential of the island, and threatened the availability of food and its security. That unprecedented cyclone and other recent natural disasters in the outermost regions of the Union within the meaning of Article 349 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) (the ‘outermost regions’) demonstrate the vulnerability of those regions to the effects of climate change, which include an increased risk of exceptional natural disasters and severe meteorological events with long-term consequences.
(2) In order to address and mitigate the impact of exceptional natural disasters or severe meteorological events in the outermost regions, in particular as regards the support for local production provided through the Programme of Options Specifically Relating to Remoteness and Insularity (‘the POSEI programme’) referred to in Regulation (EU) No 228/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council(3), it should be possible for affected beneficiaries to continue to receive POSEI programme payments throughout the restoration period, irrespective of the level of their activity, subject to a formal commitment to restore their capacity. Competent national authorities should therefore be able to decide, on the basis of relevant evidence, on the application of the principle offorce majeureor exceptional circumstances. It should also be possible, in exceptional and duly justified circumstances, for Member States to submit proposals to amend the POSEI programme, in order to extend the restoration period for certain sectors beyond the period that would be justified by the application of the principle offorce majeureor exceptional circumstances. The implementation of such amendments should be subject to an annual review and the monitoring of progress. Therefore, Articles 6 and 19 of Regulation (EU) No 228/2013 should be amended accordingly.
(3) In addition, in order to quickly address the vulnerabilities of Mayotte’s food system, and the other challenges for its rural communities, resulting from the unprecedented natural disaster caused by cyclone Chido, it is appropriate to provide, rapidly and on an exceptional basis, effective support through the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), and to provide for additional flexibility in the application of the existing rules. Article 6a of Regulation (EU) 2020/2220 of the European Parliament and of the Council(4)introduced a new measure providing exceptional temporary support in response to the impact of natural disasters to be funded under the EAFRD within the legal framework applicable in the programming period 2014-2020, as extended by that Regulation. In order to enable Mayotte to respond to the consequences of cyclone Chido, taking into account the difficulties caused by its specific situation as an outermost region, it is necessary to establish how the measure under Article 6a of Regulation (EU) 2020/2220 is to be applied to Mayotte. As the specific difficulties of responding to the exceptional situation in Mayotte are linked to its remoteness as an outermost region, the flexibility making additional EAFRD support possible should be provided through the establishment of a specific legal framework for the outermost regions. Therefore, Article 22 of Regulation (EU) No 228/2013 should be amended accordingly.
(4) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely to address and mitigate the impact of natural disasters on the agri-food and forestry sectors in the outermost regions by providing additional flexibilities after exceptional natural disasters or severe meteorological events and, in particular, after cyclone Chido in Mayotte, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but can rather be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.
(5) Regulation (EU) No 228/2013 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(6) In view of the devastating effects of the current natural disasters and the urgency of addressing and mitigating their impact on the agri-food and forestry sectors in the outermost regions, as well as the urgency in applying the measure referred to in Article 6a of Regulation (EU) 2020/2220 before the end of the programming period 2014–2020, as extended by that Regulation, it is considered to be appropriate to invoke the exception to the eight-week period provided for in Article 4 of Protocol No 1 on the role of national Parliaments in the European Union, annexed to the TEU, to the TFEU and to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community.
(7) In order to ensure the smooth implementation of amendments to Regulation (EU) No 228/2013 and as a matter of urgency in view of the pressing need to address and mitigate the impact of exceptional natural disasters or severe meteorological events in the outermost regions, and in particular that of cyclone Chido in Mayotte, this Regulation should enter into force on the day of its publication in theOfficial Journal of the European Union,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

Article 1

Regulation (EU) No 228/2013 is amended as follows:
(1) in Article 6, the following paragraph is added:‘5.   In the event of an exceptional natural disaster or severe meteorological event which totally or partially destroys the agricultural production capacity in an outermost region, a Member State may, while applying the principle offorce majeureor exceptional circumstances, submit to the Commission a proposal for amendments to the POSEI programme in order to allow the beneficiaries concerned to continue to receive POSEI programme support throughout the restoration period in the form of measures to assist local agricultural production provided for in Article 19. The implementation of those amendments to the POSEI programme shall be subject to an annual review and the monitoring of progress by the Commission and the Member State concerned, acting in close cooperation.’;
(2) in Article 19, the following paragraph is added:‘5.   Where the programme is amended in accordance with Article 6(5), beneficiaries affected by the exceptional natural disaster or severe meteorological event may continue to benefit from support in the form of measures to support production, processing or sale provided for in paragraph 4 of this Article throughout the restoration period, irrespective of the level of their activity, provided that they give a formal commitment to restore their agricultural production capacity.’;
(3) in Article 22, the following paragraphs are added:‘3.   By way of derogation from Article 6a(5) of Regulation (EU) 2020/2220 of the European Parliament and of the Council(*1), Mayotte may approve applications for support after 30 June 2025.4.   In the rural development programme of Mayotte, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) support provided for the measure referred to in Article 6a of Regulation (EU) 2020/2220 shall not exceed the total EAFRD contribution to that rural development programme for the years 2021–2022.(*1)Regulation (EU) 2020/2220 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 December 2020 laying down certain transitional provisions for support from the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and from the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) in the years 2021 and 2022 and amending Regulations (EU) No 1305/2013, (EU) No 1306/2013 and (EU) No 1307/2013 as regards resources and application in the years 2021 and 2022 and Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 as regards resources and the distribution of such support in respect of the years 2021 and 2022 (OJ L 437, 28.12.2020, p. 1, ELI:http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2020/2220/oj).’.""

Article 2

This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in theOfficial Journal of the European Union.
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.
Done at Brussels, 24 June 2025.",https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202501276,"The European Commission has proposed a legislative change aimed at providing additional assistance and flexibility to the outermost regions of the European Union, particularly in response to severe natural disasters like Cyclone Chido, which devastated Mayotte in 2024. This proposal seeks to amend existing regulations to better support these regions, which face unique challenges due to their remoteness, insularity, and economic dependence on limited sectors. These challenges are often exacerbated by frequent natural disasters that severely impact agriculture and infrastructure, making recovery difficult and prolonged.

To address these issues, the proposal enhances the Programme for the Organization of Support for the Economies of the Outermost Regions (POSEI), which provides financial support to these areas. Key changes include removing the cap on funds allocated for liquidity support to farmers and other agricultural stakeholders affected by natural disasters, allowing regions like Mayotte to reallocate more resources for recovery efforts. Additionally, the proposal extends the deadline for approving applications for this support, recognizing the need for a swift response to natural disasters and the time required for managing authorities to select beneficiaries.

The proposal also introduces a derogation to the capping of measures for Mayotte, allowing the region to address the liquidity needs of its rural population more effectively. This derogation is limited to the specific needs of Mayotte and is intended to provide targeted assistance without altering the overall legal framework of the Common Agricultural Policy and the European Structural and Investment Funds.

For Mayotte's rural development program, the proposal removes the limit on the percentage of budgetary allocations","The European Parliament and the Council have adopted a regulation to provide additional support and flexibility to the outermost regions of the European Union, particularly in response to the devastating impact of Cyclone Chido on Mayotte. This regulation aims to address the severe consequences of natural disasters in these vulnerable regions, which are significantly affected by climate change. It allows for continued financial support through the Programme of Options Specifically Relating to Remoteness and Insularity (POSEI) during the recovery period, even if local agricultural and forestry activities are disrupted. Additionally, the regulation introduces measures to offer rapid and exceptional support through the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) to help rebuild Mayotte's food system and support its rural communities. These measures are designed to be implemented at the Union level, as they are deemed more effective than individual national efforts, while ensuring that the actions taken are proportionate to the needs of the affected regions. In light of the urgent need to address the impact of such disasters, the regulation invokes an exception to expedite its implementation, allowing for amendments to existing programs to ensure continued support during the restoration period. This regulation will enter into force immediately upon publication, ensuring swift action to mitigate the effects of the disaster on Mayotte's agricultural and rural sectors."

CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  1.1. Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  The chemical industry is one of the most strategically significant sectors in the European Union, forming the backbone of numerous industrial ecosystems and playing a pivotal role in innovation, employment, and sustainable growth. As the EU advances its twin transition towards climate neutrality and digital leadership, the resilience and global competitiveness of this sector have become even more essential.  Regulatory burdens are one of the two top problems named by businesses operating in the EU when it comes to the investment climate. The high-level reports of Enrico Letta 1 and Mario Draghi placed the reduction of the regulatory burdens and simplification of EU legislation among the top priorities. Overregulation is seen by more than 60% of EU companies as an obstacle to investment, with 55% of SMEs naming regulatory obstacles and the administrative burden as their greatest challenge 2 .  I n her political guidelines for the European Commission’s 2024–2029 mandate 3 , President von der Leyen outlined a vision focused on driving sustainable prosperity and strengthening competitiveness across Europe. Central to this vision are efforts to streamline business operations and further integrate the Single Market.  Complementing this, the European Commission’s b etter regulation agenda 4 seeks to enhance the competitiveness of EU businesses by ensuring that legislation achieves its goals efficiently, without placing undue burdens on stakeholders.  Following th o se commitment s , the European Commission put forward an initiative 5 aim ing at simplifying and streamlining certain requirements and procedures for chemical products laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures 6 (‘CLP R egulation’) , Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 on cosmetic products 7 and Regulation (EU) 2019/1009 laying down rules on the making available on the market of EU fertilising products 8 identified as particularly burdensome by industry and authorities . These provisions would benefit from regulatory streamlining and modernisation, which w ould make chemical legislation more efficient and cost-effective for industry , while at the same time ensuring a hi gh level of protection of human health and the environment .  With regard to the CLP R egulation , which requires economic operators to classify, label and package their hazardous chemicals appropriately before placing them on the market , the initiative is seeking to simplify the formatting rules laid down for the labelling of hazardous chemicals and make them more flexible. This i nclud es rules on mandatory minimum font sizes and line spacing, which were identified being particularly burdensome and costly for industry 9 . It also aims to clarify rules on derogations from labelling requirements for smaller packag es and rules on the labelling of fuel pumps. T o alleviate the burden on businesses and improve the free circulation of substances and mixtures in the internal market without undermining the protection of human health and the environment, th e initiative also seeks to reduce the scope of provisions on advertisements and distance sales that relate to products placed on the market for the general public, taking into account the fact that Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 10 (‘REACH’) already provides clear obligations on information flows in professional supply chains for substances and mixtures. Furthermore, it seeks to l oosen obligations for advertisements of hazardous substances and mixtures by reducing the amount of information to be provided . In addition, it suggests removing the fixed six - month deadline for updat ing the label, while maintaining the more flexible requirement to ensure the label is updated without undue delay, as the period of six months appeared to be impossible to comply with in the complex supply chains. Finally , it proposes to broaden the use of digital labelling , allowing more pieces of information to be provided on the digital label only .  T he current proposal aims to postpon e the dates of application of the mandatory formatting requirements, provisions on advertisements and distance sales , obligations laying down six- month deadlines for the label update and rules on the labelling of fuel pumps introduced by Regulation (EU) 2024/2865 11 to provide legal certainty for businesses and to avoid having different application dates for the same type of obligations imposed on businesses by two amending acts to the CLP Regulation .  1.2. Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  The proposal is part of a package of measures on simplification that aim to streamline certain procedures and reduce administrative burden and costs for industries to ensure a well-functioning Single Market for chemicals while ensuring the same level of protection of human health and of the environment.  This proposal contains provisions that are intended to reduce the burden for Member States and industry, with the aim of making the three amended pieces of legislation easier to apply and less burdensome.  1.3. Consistency with other EU policies  Under the regulatory fitness and performance programme (REFIT), the Commission ensures that its legislation is fit for purpose, is tailored to the needs of stakeholders and minimises burdens while achieving its objectives. This proposal is therefore part of the REFIT programme, aimed at reducing reporting burdens arising from EU legislation.  This proposal is part of a series of simplification packages.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  2.1. Legal basis  This proposal has as its legal basis Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union in line with the original legal bases for the adoption of the legal acts which this proposal aims to amend.  2.2. Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  The Regulation (EU) 2024/2865 was adopted at EU level. Accordingly, amendments to this regulation need to be made at EU level.  2.3. Proportionality  The initiative does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives of simplification and burden reduction without lowering the protection of human health and environment.  2.4. Choice of the instrument  This proposal amends Regulation (EU) 2024/2865 adopted by ordinary legislative procedure and therefore the amendments of that Regulation need to be adopted by a regulation in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure.  3. RESULTS OF EX POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  3.1. Ex post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  This proposal is accompanied by a Commission staff working document that includes a detailed overview of the impact of provisions of chemical legislation that are proposed to be amended. It also provides an analysis of the positive impacts of the proposed measures, based on existing data, information gathered during the various Reality Checks and written inputs received from stakeholders, also taking into account previous analyses, such as the Fitness Check of the most relevant chemicals legislation and the impact assessment for the CLP revision.  3.2. Stakeholder consultations  V arious suggestions for simplifying or clarifying certain provisions of chemical legislation and removing the excessive administrative burden stemming from these provisions have emerged through stakeholders’ proposals for the simplification of European chemical legislation 12 .  On 16 May 2025, the European Commission held a Reality Check, aiming to gather practical feedback on the revised CLP Regulation. It was held online and draw over 570 participants from industry, consumer and environmental groups, legal practitioners, and national authorities. The event focused on identifying opportunities for simplification following the adoption of Regulation (EU) 2024/2865, while keeping the same level of protection of human health and of the environment. Stakeholders were invited to share concrete experiences and proposals on how to make the new rules more workable, particularly in operational and multilingual contexts.  Among various suggestions of stakeholders, strong calls to ‘stop the clock’ on implementation of certain provisions of Regulation 2024/2865 that create excessive administrative burden were repeated throughout the discussion. Stakeholders highlighted the need to ensure legal clarity for businesses until any Commission proposal for the revision of those rules is agreed by co-legislators  3.3. Collection and use of expertise  Different suggestions for clarifying certain provisions of chemical legislation and removing the excessive administrative burden stemming from these provisions have emerged through stakeholders’ proposals for simplification of European chemical legislation. Furthermore, in response to the Reality Checks mentioned above, the Commission received more than 150 detailed position papers from stakeholders, supporting the views expressed during the event and providing additional suggestions, data and costs estimates. Detailed summaries of these consultation activities and the input received are attached to the staff working document accompanying this proposal.  3.4. Impact assessment  Given the urgent need to reduce administrative burden and excessive costs for businesses and the lack of policy options, it has not been possible to prepare a full impact assessment.  However, following better regulation principles, this proposal is accompanied by a Commission staff working document that includes an analysis of the proposed measures, based on existing data, inputs received from stakeholders and previous analyses, such as the Fitness Check of the most relevant chemicals legislation and the impact assessment for the CLP revision.  3.5. Regulatory fitness and simplification  This proposal is part of the European Commission’s commitment to lighten the regulatory burden for people, businesses and administrations in the EU to boost prosperity and resilience of the EU. The proposal aims to provide legal clarity for businesses and ensure that rules imposed by different EU acts to the same type of obligations are consistently taking effect from the same date.  3.6. Fundamental rights  The proposal respects the fundamental rights enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union 13 and adheres to the principles recognised therein . The reduction of administrative burden on companies should lead to societal gains in terms of wealth creation, employment and innovation. At the same time, the proposal seeks to ensure a high level of protection of human health and of the environment.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  This initiative will not imply any additional costs for the Commission.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  5.1. Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  The Commission will monitor the implementation and application of new provisions and compliance with them. This proposal does not require an implementation plan.  5.2. Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  The proposal amends Article 2 of the Regulation (EU) 2024/2865 that sets the dates of entry into force and entry into application of the provisions of that Regulation.  Provisions amending Article 30 laying down timelines for relabelling, Article 48 on advertisements, Article 48a on distance sales and provisions on labelling of fuel pumps in Annex II are removed from the list of provisions that will apply as of 1 July 2026 as outlined in paragraph 2 of Article 2.  Similarly, provisions amending Article 31(3) and relevant sections of Annex I on mandatory formatting requirements are removed from the list of provisions that will apply as of 1 January 2027 as outlined in paragraph 3 of Article 2.  A new paragraph 3a is inserted in Article 2 laying down a new application date of 1 January 2028 for all abovementioned provisions.  Consequently, the provisions that are subject to extended deferred application dates are removed from the provision that allows the voluntary application of the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2024/2865 before their entry into application in paragraphs 4 and 5 of Article 2, and moved to a new paragraph 5a, aligning the date of the application of that provision with the new deferred application date.  The application dates of other provisions of Regulation (EU) 2024/2865 remain unchanged.  2025/0526 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulation (EU) 2024/2865 as regards dates of application and transitional provisions  (Text with EEA relevance)  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national Parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 14 ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council 15 contains certain requirements as regards the classification, labelling , and packaging of hazardous substances and mixtures. That Regulation was amended by Regulation (EU) 2024/2865 of the European Parliament and of the Council 16 , which inter alia introduced specific rules on the formatting of labels, deadlines for relabelling in case of classification changes, information requirements for advertisements and distance sales offers and labelling requirements for fuelling station s . Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2024/2865 deferred the date of application of those rules.  (2) T he 2024 Draghi report 17 highlighted that the number and the complexity of rules risk limit ing the room for manoeuvre for U nion undertakings and prevent ing them from remaining competitive . A detailed analysis of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 18 also pointed to excessive administrative burden and costs associated with requirements introduced by Regulation (EU) 2024/2865 . Based on those findings , the Commission has laid down a proposal to simplify certain requirements and procedures for chemical products 19 . That proposal is, inter alia , intended to better balanc e, on the one hand, the need for label information to be clearly understood by consumers and, on the other hand, the need to reduce market barriers and administrative burden for industry 20 . In light of that proposal , it is necessary to further defer the obligations on label formatting , advertisements, distance sales offers and relabelling that were introduced by Regulation (EU) 2024/2865 . Such further deferral would enable economic operators to prepare for changes to the formatting and labelling requirements , as well as new information requirements for advertisements and distance sales offers envisaged in the Commission ’s proposal.  (3) Regulation (EU) 2024/2865 introduced specific provisions for the labelling of fuels supplied at fuelling stations. However, certain requirements, including the requirement to indicate the supplier, the nominal quantity, and the unique formula identifier, appeared to be impractical and costly for undertakings, without bringing benefits to the protection of human health and the environment. For that reason, the Commission proposal as regards simplification of certain requirements and procedures for chemical products intends to modify those requirements to make them more apt by removing unnecessary and burdensome labelling requirements. In light of those anticipated modifications, it is appropriate to further defer the date of application of those requirements .  (4) Article 2(4) and (5) of Regulation (EU) 2024/2865 contain transitional provisions that enable undertakings to apply the provisions introduced by that Regulation before the dates of their applica tion on a voluntary basis. To ensur e consistency with the longer deferr al and to provid e legal clarity for economic operators , it is necessary to amend the dates of application of th o se transitional provisions on mandatory formatting requirements, relabelling, advertisements, distance offers and labelling of fuelling stations and align those dates with the extend ed deferred applicability dates .  (5) T o ensur e a high level of protection of human health and the environment, the application dates of other provisions of Regulation (EU) 2024/2865 should remain unchanged.  (6) Regulation (E U ) 20 24 / 2865 should therefore be amended accordingly ,  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Article 1  Amendments to Regulation (EU) 2024/2865  Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2024/2865 is amended as follows:  (1) p aragraph 2 is replaced by the following:  ‘2.

(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1) ,
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2) ,
Whereas:
(1)  Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) sets out certain requirements as regards the classification, labelling, and packaging of substances and mixtures. That Regulation was amended by Regulation (EU) 2024/2865 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) , which, inter alia, introduced specific rules on the formatting of labels, deadlines for relabelling in case of changes in classification, information requirements for advertisements and distance sales offers and labelling requirements for filling stations. Regulation (EU) 2024/2865 also deferred the date of application of those rules.
(2)  The 2024 report entitled ‘The future of European competitiveness’ (the Draghi report) highlighted that the number and the complexity of rules risk limiting the room for manoeuvre for Union undertakings and preventing them from remaining competitive. A detailed analysis of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 also pointed to excessive administrative burden and costs associated with requirements introduced by Regulation (EU) 2024/2865. Based on those findings, the Commission has proposed to simplify certain requirements and procedures for chemical products (5) . That proposal is intended, inter alia , to balance better, on the one hand, the need for labelling information to be clearly understood by consumers and, on the other hand, the need to reduce market barriers and administrative burden for industry, as expressed in the Commission Communication entitled ‘The Single Market: our European home market in an uncertain world, a strategy for making the Single Market simple, seamless and strong’. In light of that proposal, it is necessary to further defer the obligations introduced by Regulation (EU) 2024/2865 on formatting of labels, advertisements, distance sales offers and relabelling. Such further deferral would enable economic operators to prepare for changes to the formatting and labelling requirements, as well as new information requirements for advertisements and distance sales offers envisaged in the Commission’s proposal.
(3)  Regulation (EU) 2024/2865 introduced specific provisions for the labelling of fuels supplied at filling stations. However, certain requirements, including the requirement to indicate the supplier, the nominal quantity, and the unique formula identifier, appeared to be impractical and costly for undertakings, without bringing any benefit to the protection of human health and the environment. Therefore, the Commission intends to modify those requirements to make them more apt by removing unnecessary and burdensome labelling requirements. In light of those anticipated modifications, it is appropriate to further defer the date of application of those requirements.
(4)  Regulation (EU) 2024/2865 contains transitional provisions that enable undertakings to apply, on a voluntary basis, the new rules introduced by that Regulation before the dates of their application. To ensure consistency with the longer deferral and to provide legal clarity for economic operators, it is necessary to amend the dates of application of those transitional provisions on mandatory formatting requirements, relabelling, advertisements, distance sales offers and labelling of filling stations and align them with the extended deferred applicability dates.
(5)  To ensure a high level of protection of human health and the environment, the application dates of other provisions of Regulation (EU) 2024/2865 should remain unchanged.
(6)  Regulation (EU) 2024/2865 should therefore be amended accordingly,

Done at Strasbourg, 26 November 2025.",https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202502439,"The European Commission has proposed a regulation aimed at modernizing and simplifying the legislative framework governing chemical products within the EU. This initiative is part of a broader effort to reduce regulatory burdens and streamline processes for businesses, particularly in the chemical industry, which is vital for the EU's economy and innovation. The proposal seeks to amend existing regulations related to the classification, labeling, and packaging of chemical substances, mixtures, cosmetic products, and fertilizing products.

Key aspects of the proposal include making labeling requirements for hazardous chemicals more flexible, addressing costly issues such as mandatory font sizes and line spacing. It also aims to simplify labeling for smaller packages and fuel pumps, and ease obligations related to advertisements and distance sales of chemical products, recognizing that existing regulations already cover professional supply chains effectively. Additionally, the proposal suggests removing the fixed six-month deadline for updating labels, allowing updates to occur without undue delay, and expanding the use of digital labeling to provide more information digitally.

To ensure a smooth transition, the proposal outlines specific application dates for the new requirements, aiming to provide legal certainty and consistency across different regulations. It also addresses specific formatting requirements and deadlines for relabeling in case of classification changes, as well as information requirements for advertisements and distance sales offers. The proposal seeks to balance the clarity of label information for consumers with the need to reduce market barriers and administrative burdens for the industry. The regulation is set to enter into force on the twentieth day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union and will be","The European Parliament and the Council have adopted a regulation to amend existing rules on the classification, labeling, and packaging of chemical products, aiming to simplify regulations and reduce administrative burdens on businesses. This amendment defers the implementation of certain labeling requirements, particularly addressing the impracticality and high costs associated with labeling fuels at filling stations. It extends the transitional period for businesses to voluntarily apply new rules, allowing more time for preparation. The regulation maintains certain provisions to protect human health and the environment while streamlining processes to enhance the competitiveness of European businesses. Specific derogations allow substances and mixtures to be classified, labeled, and packaged under previous regulations until specified dates, providing flexibility during the transition. The regulation will enter into force twenty days after its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union and will be directly applicable in all Member States."

a  DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Directives (EU) 2022/2464 and (EU) 2024/1760 as regards the dates from which Member States are to apply certain corporate sustainability reporting and due diligence requirements  (Text with EEA relevance)  {SWD(2025) 80}  EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM  1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  General context and objectives  In his report on ‘The Future of European Competitiveness’, Mario Draghi emphasised the need for Europe to create a regulatory landscape which facilitates competitiveness and resilience , drawing attention to burden and compliance costs created by the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive ( CSRD ) and the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive ( CSDDD ) . 1 In the Budapest Declaration on the New European Competitiveness Deal, EU Heads of State and Government called for ‘ a simplification revolution, ensuring a clear, simple and smart regulatory framework for businesses and drastically reducing administrative, regulatory and reporting burdens, in particular for SMEs ’ . 2 They called on the Commission to make concrete proposals to reduce reporting requirements by at least 25% in the first half of 2025.  In its Communication on the Competitive Compass for the EU, the Commission confirmed that it would propose a first ‘ Simplification Omnibus package ’ which would include far-reaching simplification in the fields of sustainable finance reporting, sustainability due diligence and taxonomy. 3 In its Communication entitled ‘A simpler and faster Europe: Communication on implementation and simplification’, the Commission set out an implementation and simplification agenda that delivers fast and visible improvements for people and business on the ground , requiring more than an incremental approach and underlining the need for bold action to streamline and simplify EU, national and regional rules. 4  The CSRD entered into force on 5 January 2023 . 5 It strengthened and modernised corporate sustainability reporting requirements through modifications to the Accounting Directive, the Transparency Directive, the Audit Directive and the Audit Regulation. 6 The CSRD is an important element of the European Green Deal and of the Sustainable Finance Action Plan . 7 It aims to ensure that investors have the information they need to understand and manage the risks to which investee companies are exposed from climate change and other sustainability issues . It also aims to ensure that investors and other stakeholders have the information they need about the impacts of companies on people and the environment. It thereby contributes to financial stability and environmental integrity. This is a necessary condition for financial resources to flow to companies that pursue sustainability goals and creates more accountability and transparency towards all stakeholders regarding companies’ sustainability performance.  The CSDDD was adopted on 13 June 2024. Its objective is to contribute to the European Union's broader ambition to transition towards a sustainable and climate-neutral economy as outlined in the European Green Deal. It requires companies to identify and address adverse human rights and environmental impacts in their own operations, those of their subsidiaries and their chains of activities.  The CSRD and the CSDDD are now being implemented in a new and difficult context. Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine has driven up energy prices for EU undertakings. Trade tensions are rising as the geopolitical landscape continues to shift. The different approach undertaken by some other major jurisdictions regarding the regulation of corporate sustainability reporting and due diligence raises questions about the effects of these laws on the competitive positioning of EU companies. The ability of the Union to preserve and protect its values depends amongst other things on the capacity of its economy to adapt and compete in an unstable and sometimes hostile geopolitical context.  This proposal therefore postpones the entry into application of the CSDDD and of certain provisions of the CSRD.  Specific context and objectives of this proposal regarding the CSRD  The CSRD currently applies to large undertakings , SMEs with securities listed on the EU regulated markets, parent undertakings of large groups , as well as to issuers that belong to these categories of undertakings . The entry into application of the reporting requirements introduced by the CSRD is phased in according to different categories of undertakings. In the first wave, large public interest entities with more than 500 employees must report for the first time in 2025 for financial year 2024. 8 In the second wave, the other large undertakings must report in 2026 for financial year 2025. 9 In the third wave, SMEs with securities listed in EU regulated markets must report in 2027 for financial year 2026, although they have a possibility to opt out of reporting for financial years 2026 and 2027. 10 In the fourth wave, certain non-EU undertakings that have business in the territory of the Union above certain thresholds must report in 2029 for financial year 2028. 11  The CSRD requires undertakings in scope to report sustainability information according to mandatory European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) and requires the Commission to adopt such standards through delegated acts. In July 2023 t he Commission adopted a first set of ESRS which are sector-agnostic, meaning they are to be applied by all undertakings in scope independently of the sector of the economy in which the undertaking operates. 12 The CSRD also requires the Commission to adopt sector-specific reporting standards, with a first set of such standards to be adopted by June 2026. The CSRD allows listed SMEs to report using a separate and lighter , proportionate set of standards instead of the full set of ESRS.  At the request of the Commission, EFRAG has submitted a sustainability reporting standard for voluntary use by SMEs that are not in scope of the reporting requirements (VSME standard) . 13 The objective of the VSME standard is to provid e SMEs with a simple, widely recognised tool through which they can provide sustainability information to banks, large companies and other stakeholders that may demand such information.  Other important aspects of the CSRD are the provisions on assurance and on reporting value-chain information. Undertakings must publish their sustainability information together with the opinion of a statutory auditor or, if the Member States allows, an independent assurance service provider. The current requirement is for limited assurance and the CSRD provides that this could in the future become a requirement for reasonable assurance under certain conditions. 14 The CSRD also requires the Commission to adopt standards for sustainability assurance by means of delegated acts.  The CSRD requires undertakings to report value-chain information to the extent necessary for understanding their sustainability-related impacts, risks and opportunities. The CSRD establishes a so-called value-chain cap, which states that ESRS may not contain reporting requirements that would require undertakings to obtain from SMEs in their value chain information that exceeds the information to be disclosed under the proportionate standard for listed SMEs.  This proposal aims to reduce the reporting burden and to limit the trickle down of obligations on smaller companies. Firstly, the separate legislative proposal made by the Commission in parallel to this proposal would simplify the framework and reduce burden in the following ways:  – The number of undertakings subject to mandatory sustainability reporting requirements would be reduced by about 8 0 %, taking out of scope large undertakings with up to 1000 employees (i.e. some of the undertakings from the second wave and some of the undertakings from the first wave ) and listed SMEs (i.e. all undertakings in the third wave). The reporting requirements would only apply to large undertakings with more than 1000 employees on average (i.e. undertakings that have more than 1000 employees and either a turnover above EUR 50 million or a balance sheet above EUR 25 million). This revised threshold would align the CSRD more closely with the CSDDD. 15  – For undertakings not subject to mandatory sustainability reporting requirements , the Commission proposes a proportionate standard for voluntary use which would be based on the VSME standard developed by EFRAG. According to this proposal, the Commission would adopt this voluntary standard as a delegated act. In the meantime, to address market demand, the Commission intends to issue a recommendation on voluntary sustainability reporting as soon as possible, based on the VSME standard developed by EFRAG.  – The value-chain cap would be extended and strengthened. It would apply directly to the reporting company instead of being only a limit on what ESRS can specify. It would protect all undertakings with up to 1000 employees rather than just SMEs as is currently the case. And the limit would be defined by the voluntary standard adopted by the Commission as a delegated act , based on the VSME standard developed by EFRAG . This will substantially reduce the trickle-down effect.  – There would be no sector-specific reporting standards, so avoiding an increase in the number of prescribed datapoints that undertakings should report.  – The possibility of moving from a requirement for limited assurance to a requirement for reasonable assurance would be removed. This will provide clarity that there will be no future increase in costs of assurance for undertakings in scope.  – Instead of an obligation for the Commission to adopt standards for sustainability assurance by 2026, the Commission will issue targeted assurance guidelines by 2026 . This will allow the Commission to more quickly address emerging issues in the field of sustainability assurance that may be generating unnecessary burden on undertakings that are subject to the reporting requirements.  – The proposal introduces an “opt-in” regime where large undertakings with more than 1000 employees on average (i.e. undertakings that have more than 1000 employees and either a turnover above EUR 50 million or a balance sheet above EUR 25 million) and a net turnover not exceeding EUR 450 million which claim that their activities are aligned or partially aligned with the EU Taxonomy shall disclose their turnover and CapEx KPIs and may choose to disclose their OpEx KPI. This “opt-in” approach will eliminate entirely the cost of compliance with the Taxonomy reporting rules for large undertakings with more than 1000 employees on average (i.e. undertakings that have more than 1000 employees and either a turnover above EUR 50 million or a balance sheet above EUR 25 million) and a net turnover not exceeding EUR 450 million which do not claim that their activities are associated with economic activities that qualify as environmentally sustainable under the Taxonomy Regulation. In addition, this proposal provides more flexibility by allowing these undertakings to report on activities that meet certain Taxonomy technical screening criteria without meeting all of them. Such reporting on partial alignment can foster a gradual environmental transition of activities overtime, in line with the aim to scale up transition finance.  Secondly, the Commission intends to adopt without delay a delegated act to revise the first set of ESRS. To deliver swiftly on the simplification and streamlining of the ESRS, and to provide clarity and legal certainty to undertakings, the Commission aims to adopt the necessary delegated act as soon as possible, and at the latest six months after the entry into force of the Directive to simplify the reporting framework that is the subject of the separate legislative proposal referred to above. The revision of the delegated act will substantially reduce the number of mandatory ESRS datapoints by (i) removing those deemed least important for general purpose sustainability reporting, (ii) prioritising quantitative datapoints over narrative text and (iii) further distinguishing between mandatory and voluntary datapoints, without undermining interoperability with global reporting standards and without prejudice to the materiality assessment of each undertaking. The revision will clarify provisions that are deemed unclear. It will improve consistency with other pieces of EU legislation. It will provide clearer instructions on how to apply the materiality principle, to ensure that undertakings only report material information and to reduce the risk that assurance service providers inadvertently encourage undertakings to report information that is not necessary or dedicate excessive resources to the materiality assessment process. It will simplify the structure and presentation of the standards. It will further enhance the already very high degree of interoperability with global sustainability reporting standards. It will also make any other modifications that may be considered necessary considering the experience of the first application of ESRS.  Thirdly, this proposal would postpone by two years the entry into application of the reporting requirements for the second wave (large undertakings that are not public interest entities and that have more than 500 employees , as well as large undertakings with fewer than 500 employees 16 ) and the third wave (listed SMEs , small and non-complex credit institutions, and captive insurance and reinsurance undertakings ). The objective of the postponement is to avoid a situation in which certain undertakings are required to report for financial year 2025 (second wave) or 2026 (third wave) and are then subsequently relieved of this requirement. Such a situation would mean that the undertakings in question incur unnecessary and avoidable costs.  The Commission invites co-legislators to reach rapid agreement on the proposed postponement, in particular to provide the necessary legal clarity for undertakings in the second wave that are currently required to report for the first time in 2026 for financial year 2025.  Specific context and objectives of this proposal regarding the CSDDD  According to the current rules, Member States should transpose the CSDDD by 26 July 2026. Entry into application is envisaged in three phases: as from July 2027, the rules would start applying only to the largest EU companies, i.e. those that have more than 5000 employees and report a net annual (worldwide) turnover of more than 1.5 billion euro, as well as to non-EU companies that generate more than EUR 1.5 billion net turnover in the EU. In the second wave, EU companies with more than 3000 employees and more than EUR 900 million net turnover, as well as non-EU companies generating such net turnover in the EU would need to comply with the new framework as from July 2028. Last, in July 2029, all other companies falling under the general scope would have to start applying the (national rules transposing the) Directive. As from this date, the CSDDD is estimated to apply to approximately 6000 large EU companies, and some 900 non-EU companies. The personal scope and phased-in application take into account that companies of different size have different capacities to implement the new mandatory framework and, as such, is a key element in ensuring a proportional approach.  In addition, the separate legislative proposal made by the Commission in parallel with this proposal would simplify the framework and reduce companies’ burden in a number of ways. This proposal would postpone the first phase of the entry into application of the Directive by one year. The objective of the postponement is to provide additional time for the first group of companies to prepare for their obligations under the Directive, as amended, also taking into account the guidelines that the Commission will have adopted in accordance with the tighter timeline set out in the parallel simplification proposal.  Moreover, this proposal would postpone the transposition deadline for the Member States by one year to account for possible delays in their ongoing CSDDD transposition efforts due to possible amendments to the Directive by the parallel simplification proposal.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  Undertakings that are subject to the CSRD reporting requirements are also automatically required to report certain indicators under article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation. By postponing the application of the reporting requirements for companies in the second and third waves, this proposal would therefore also automatically postpone the date by when such companies must report those indicators under the Taxonomy Regulation.  The reporting requirements set out in the CSRD and ESRS aim to ensure, amongst other things, that financial market participants, credit institutions and benchmark administrators have access to the sustainability information that they need from undertakings to meet their own reporting obligations under the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation, the Capital Requirements Regulation and the Benchmarks Regulation. The proposed postponement will delay improvements to availability of information for financial market participants, credit institutions and benchmark administrators.  Undertakings subject to both the CSRD and the CSDDD are not required by the CSDDD to report any information additional to what they are required to report under the CSRD. Since this proposal postpones the measures foreseen in the CSDDD as well as the date of application of the reporting requirements for certain undertakings under the CSRD, meaning that the consistency between these two pieces of legislation is maintained.  • Consistency with other Union policies  This proposal is consistent with EU policy to enhance competitiveness, to simplify the regulatory framework and to reduce burden on business while still achieving the policy goals of the CSRD and CSDDD. This includes preserving the Green Deal as mid- to long-term competitiveness depends on companies sufficiently integrating sustainability considerations into their operations.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  The proposal’s legal basis rests on Articles 50 and 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Article 50 of the TFEU is the legal basis for adopting EU measures aimed at attaining the right of establishment in the single market in company law, and it mandates the European Parliament and the Council to act by means of Directives. Article 114 of the TFEU is a general legal basis with the objective of establishing or ensuring the functioning of the single market – in this case, the free movement of capital. Articles 50 and 114 of the TFEU are the legal basis for Directive (EU) 2022/2464 and Directive (EU) 2024/1760.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  This proposal modifies the dates of entry of application of certain provisions of EU law. These dates can only be modified through action at EU level.  • Proportionality  The policy objective is to delay the dates of entry of application of certain provisions of EU law. There only means of achieving that objective is to propose to modify those dates  • Choice of the instrument  This proposal is composed of a Directive that amends provisions of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and of the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD). An Omnibus Directive is considered to be the most appropriate legal instrument to amend existing Directives as regards simplification and burden reduction in the area of sustainability reporting and due diligence.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  The CSDDD has not yet been transposed or applied by companies. The CSRD has been applied by a first set of companies who are publishing their first sustainability statements mainly in the first half of 2025. It has therefore not been possible to undertake an ex-post evaluation or fitness check of either piece of legislation.  • Stakeholder consultations  The following consultation activities have helped to shape the content of this proposal.  - European Commission ‘Call for evidence on the rationalisation of reporting requirements’, from October to December 2023. 17  - European Commission ‘Reality Check on Sustainability Reporting and Roundtable on Simplification’ in early February 2025.  - The European Commission has also held separate stakeholder activities including two large hybrid stakeholder forums on the CSRD in May and November 2024 with the participation o f more than 400 people in person and more than 3000 people virtually.  - The European Commission received a very significant number of letters and detailed analyses from all types of stakeholders (from companies to investors, banks, civil society, Non-Governmental Organisations, chambers of commerce and Member States’ national administrations).  Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive  The European Commission’s Call for Evidence on the Rationalisation of Reporting Requirements sought evidence and views regarding regulations which are perceived to produce administrative burden. Almost 200 stakeholders responded, and primarily called for a simplification of sustainability reporting, due diligence and the EU Taxonomy.  In the European Commission’s meetings with European industry, social partners and civil society in early February 2025, stakeholders expressed support for the overarching objectives of the CSRD and CSDDD but highlighted a need for simplification and harmonisation in their implementation.  Some stakeholders, particularly business and industry groups, suggested pausing the application of existing legislation to focus on simplification. They argued that a postponement of the reporting requirements of the CSRD would give the Commission the opportunity to simplify the framework while allowing companies more time to prepare for any impending changes.  Other stakeholders, particularly civil society groups, saw strong merits in maintaining the rules and argued for the importance of legal certainty and regulatory stability for companies, as well as for maintaining the objectives of the European Green Deal and the Sustainable Finance Action Plan. They also highlighted that implementation guidelines should be used to clarify and simplify certain parts of the sustainability reporting framework, instead of a postponement or change to the existing rules.  The need for simplification has also been echoed by many other reports, recommendations, and stakeholder views from both financial and non-financial sector undertakings, many of which underscore the importance of reducing complexity and administrative burdens and which have informed the burden reduction measures described in this proposal.  Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive  Consultations with various stakeholders, including businesses, trade associations, and civil society organizations, as well as other contacts with and inputs received from stakeholders have informed the proposal. This includes, in particular, a two days-stakeholder event that allowed the Commission to hear from practitioners about which challenges they see with the current legislative framework and what could be possible solutions to address them. While some stakeholders called for far-reaching changes and postponements, others emphasized the need for regulatory certainty and opposed reopening the Directive, instead focusing on implementation. The proposal, together with the parallel proposal on simplification, aims to balance these perspectives by maintaining the integrity of the CSDDD while introducing changes to simplify and streamline the Directive.  • Collection and use of expertise  Not applicable.  • Impact assessment  This proposal is accompanied by a Commission Staff Working Document that includes an analysis of the impacts of the proposed measures. Given the urgent need to put forward proposals to address the identified problems, it has not been possible to prepare a full impact assessment.  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  This proposal is expressly designed to facilitate a major simplification of the sustainability reporting regime.  • Fundamental rights  Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive  The proposal respects the fundamental rights enshrined, and adheres to the principles stated, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive has an indirect positive impact on fundamental rights, given that sustainability reporting requirements can influence corporate behaviour for the better. It serves to make companies more aware of fundamental rights and positively influence how they identify and manage actual and potential adverse impacts on fundamental rights. The proposed postponement would also delay these positive impacts with regard to companies that would start applying the reporting requirements at a later date. However the reduction of burden on such companies, and especially the reduction of burden on companies that would be taken out of the CSRD scope by the separate proposal made by the Commission in parallel to this proposal, should lead to other societal gains in terms of wealth creation, employment and innovation, including innovation for sustainability.  Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive  The proposal respects the fundamental rights enshrined, and adheres to the principles stated, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. The CSDDD has protection and promotion of fundamental rights as one of its main objectives. It requires very large companies to identify and address adverse human rights and environmental impacts in their own operations, those of their subsidiaries and their chains of activities. The proposed postponement would delay these positive impacts with regard to the first group of companies in the scope of the Directive that would start applying the due diligence requirements at a later date.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  The proposal does not have any budgetary implications.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  Not applicable.  • Explanatory documents (for directives)  No explanatory documents are considered necessary.  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  Article 1 amends Article 5(2) of Directive (EU) 2022/2464 (Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive “CSRD”) by introducing a 2-year postponement of the sustainability reporting requirements for all companies in the CSRD scope that are required to comply from financial year 2025 or 2026 depending on their size.  In particular:  – Paragraph (1) point (a) require s Member States to ensure that the following undertakings report on sustainability from fi nanci al years starting on or after 1 January 2027 (instead of 1 January 2025):  · large undertakings with not more than 500 employees on average during the financial year ;  · large undertakings with more than 500 employees on average during the financial year but that are not public-interest entities ;  · parent undertakings of a large group with more than 500 employees on average on its balance sheet dates, on a consolidated basis, during the financial year;  · parent undertakings of a large group with more than 500 employees on average on its balance sheet dates, on a consolidated basis, during the financial year , but that are not public-interest entities;  – paragraph (1) point ( b ) requires Member States to ensure that SMEs with securities admitted to trading on an EU regulated market, small and non-complex institutions (provided they are large undertakings or listed SMEs) and EU captive (re)insurance undertakings (provided they are large undertakings or listed SMEs) report on sustainability from financial years starting on or after 1 January 202 8 (instead of 1 January 202 6 );  – paragraph (2) point ( a ) requires Member States to ensure that the following issuers report on sustainability from financial years starting on or after 1 January 2027 (instead of 1 January 2025) :  · issuers that are large undertakings with not more than 500 employees on average during the financial year ;  · issuers that are parent undertakings of a large group with not more than 500 employees on average, on a consolidated basis, during the financial year;  – paragraph (2) point ( b ) requires Member States to ensure that issuer s that are SMEs , small and non-complex institutions (provided they are large undertakings or listed SMEs) and EU captive (re)insurance undertakings (provided they are large undertakings or listed SMEs) report on sustainability from financial years starting on or after 1 January 2028 (instead of 1 January 2026) .  Article 2 amends Article 37 of Directive (EU) 2024/1760 (Corporate Due Diligence Directive ""CSDDD”) by postponing the transposition deadline as well as the application of the Directive by 1 year for the first group of companies in the scope of the Directive.  Article 3 requires Member States to transpose Article 1 of this Directive by 31 December 2025 at the latest, and to communicate to the Commission the text of their transposing measures.  Article 4 specifies that this Directive enters into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.  2025/0044 (COD)  Proposal for a  DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Directives (EU) 2022/2464 and (EU) 2024/1760 as regards the dates from which Member States are to apply certain corporate sustainability reporting and due diligence requirements  (Text with EEA relevance)  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 50 and 114 thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 18 ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) In its Communication of 11 February 2025 entitled ‘A simpler and faster Europe: Communication on implementation and simplification’ 19 , the Commission set out a vision for an implementation and simplification agenda that delivers fast and visible improvements for people and business on the ground. Th at requires more than an incremental approach and the U nion is to take bold action to achieve th at goal. The Commission, the European Parliament, the Council, Member States’ authorities at all levels and stakeholders need to work together to streamline and simplify U nion , national and regional rules and implement policies more effectively.  (2) In the context of the Commission’s commitment to reduce reporting burdens and enhance competitiveness, it is necessary to introduce targeted amendments to Directive s (EU) 2022/2464 20 and (EU) 2024/1760 21 of the European Parliament and of the Council , to achieve th o se objectives, whilst maintaining the policy objectives of the Green Deal 22 and the Sustainable Finance Action Plan 23 .  (3) Article 5(2) first subparagraph of Directive (EU) 2022/2464 specifies the date s from which Member States are to apply the sustainability reporting requirements set out in Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council 24 , with different dates depe n ding on the size of the undertaking concerned . Large undertakings that are public-interest entities with more than 500 employees on average during the financial year , and public-interest entities that are parent undertakings of a large group with more than 500 employees on average, on its balance sheet dates, on a consolidated basis, during the financial year , are to report in 2025 for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2024. The other large undertakings , and the other parent undertakings of a large group, are to report in 2026 for fina n cial years beginning on or after 1 January 2025 . Sm all and medium-sized undertakings - excluding micro-undertakings - , small and non-complex institutions and captive (re)insurance undertakings are to report in 2027 for fina n cial years beginning on or after 1 January 2026. Considering the ongoing Commission ’s initiatives aiming at simplify ing certain existing sustainability reporting obligation s and to reduce the undertakings’ related administrative burden, t o provide for legal clarity , and to avoid that the undertakings currently required to report for financial year s beginning on or after 1 January 2025 and on or after 1 January 2026 incur unnecessary and avoidable costs , the sustainability reporting requirements for th o se undertakings should be postponed by two years respectively .  (4) Article 5(2) , third subparagraph of Directive (EU) 2022/2464 specifies the dates from which Member States are to apply the sustainability reporting requirements set out in Directive 2004/109/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 25 , with different dates depe n ding on the size of the issuer concerned . Issuers that are l arge undertakings with more than 500 employees on average during the financial year , and issuers that are parent undertakings of a large group with more than 500 employees on average, on its balance sheet dates, on a consolidated basis, during the financial year, are to report in 2025 for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2024. The other issuers that are large undertakings , and the other issuers that are parent undertakings of a large group, are to report in 2026 for fina n cial years beginning on or after 1 January 2025. Issuers that are s mall and medium-sized undertakings - excluding micro-undertakings -, small and non-complex institutions and captive (re)insurance undertakings are to report in 2027 for fina n cial years beginning on or after 1 January 2026. Considering the ongoing Commission’s initiatives aiming at simplify ing certain existing sustainability reporting obligations and to reduce the undertakings’ related administrative burden, to provide for legal clarity , and to avoid that the issuers currently required to report for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2025 and on or after 1 January 2026 incur unnecessary and avoidable costs, the sustainability reporting requirements for th o se issuers should be postponed by two years respectively.  (5) The date by which Member States are to appl y Directive 2024/1760 should be postponed by one year for the first group of companies in the scope of th at Directive, to give companies more time to prepare for the requirements of that Directive and to provide them with the opportunity to take into account the guidelines to be issued by the Commission on how they should fulfil their due diligence obligations in a practical manner .  (6) Moreover, in light of the parallel legislative proposal aiming at simplify ing the sustainability framework and reduce burdens for companies, the deadline for the Member States t o transpos e Directive 2024/1760 should be extended by one year to account for possible delays in their ongoing transposition efforts due to possible amendments to th at Directive.  (7) Since the objectives of this Directive cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives.  (8) Directive s (EU) 2022/2464 and (EU) 2024/1760 should therefore be amended accordingly .  (9) For reasons of urgency and to provide legal certainty as soon as possible, this Directive should enter into force on the day following that of its publication,  HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:  Article 1  Amendments to Directive (EU) 2022/2464  In Directive (EU) 2022/2464, Article 5(2) is amended as follows:  (1) t he first subparagraph is amende d as follows:  (a) in point (b) , the introductory wording is replaced by the following:  ‘for financial years starting on or after 1 January 2027:’;  (b) in point (c), the introductory wording is replaced by the following:  ‘for financial years starting on or after 1 January 2028:’;  (2) t he third subparagraph is amended as follows:  (a) in point (b), the introductory wording is replaced by the following:  ‘for financial years starting on or after 1 January 2027:’;  (b) in point (c), the introductory wording is replaced by the following:  ‘for financial years starting on or after 1 January 2028:’.

Title of the proposal/initiative  Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directives (EU) 2022/2464 and (EU) 2024/1760 as regards certain corporate sustainability reporting and due diligence requirements for undertakings.  1.2. Policy area(s) concerned  Capital Markets Union, Savings and Investment Union, European Green Deal, Sustainable Finance Strategy, Company law and corporate governance  1.3. Objective(s)  1.3.1. General objective(s)  The general objectives pursued by this legislative proposal are to simplify and reduce certain elements of Directive 2006/43/EC, Directive 2013/34EU, Directive (EU) 2022/2464 and Directive (EU) 2024/1760 in order to alleviate the reporting burden on companies in scope of the requirements.  By reducing the administrative burden associated with reporting requirements and compliance costs of sustainability reporting stemming from the above legislation, this proposal intends to enhance the proportionality of the framework and the competitiveness of European companies, while also maintaining the objectives of the European Green Deal.  1.3.2. Specific objective(s)  The specific objectives of the proposed amendments to Directive (EU) 2022/2464 included in this proposal aim to achieve the following results:  – Postpone the sustainability reporting requirements on wave 2 and wave 3 companies by two years.  The specific objectives of the proposed amendments to Directive (EU) 2024/1760 included in this proposal aim to achieve the following results:  – Postpone the transposition deadline and the application of the sustainability due diligence requirements for wave 1 companies by one year.  1.3.3. Expected result(s) and impact  Specify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.  The expected results and impact of the proposed amendments are to simplify sustainability reporting requirements and as a result reduce the administrative burden on companies in this regard, whilst maintaining the objectives of the European Green Deal and the Sustainable Finance Action Plan. The proposed amendments are also expected to result in significant cost savings for companies in scope when carrying out sustainability reporting.  The amendments to Directive (EU) 2024/1760 included in this proposal are expected to ease the compliance burden of companies as they will have more time to prepare for compliance, adjust their policies, processes and procedures, also taking into account the guidelines which the Commission will issue, allowing them to build on best practices and reduce their reliance on legal counselling and advisory services.  1.3.4. Indicators of performance  Specify the indicators for monitoring progress and achievements.  The CSRD has been applied by a first set of companies who are publishing their first sustainability statements mainly in the first half of 2025. It has therefore not been possible to undertake an ex-post evaluation or fitness check of either piece of legislation.  To monitor progress towards achieving the proposal’s specific objectives, the Commission will explore the possibility of organising exchanges with stakeholders in different formats as well as periodic surveys of users of sustainability information and of undertakings that report such information, depending on the availability of financial resources. Article 6 of the CSRD requires the Commission to present a report on the implementation of the Directive by April 2029.  In this proposal, the Commission also commits to revising the first set of ESRS. Under Directive 2013/34/EU, the Commission is required to review those sustainability reporting standards, including the sustainability reporting standards for small and medium-sized undertakings, every three years to take account of relevant developments, including the development of international standards.  The implementation of the CSDDD as amended, and its effectiveness in reaching its objectives, in particular in addressing adverse impacts, will also be subject to regular evaluation according to Article 36 of that Directive.  A number of indicators will be used to monitor the progress of these proposals, such as the effectiveness and timeliness of the actions proposed, the efficiency of processes for collecting and processing data in accordance with the sustainability reporting requirements, and the objective to limit administrative burden and avoid unnecessary or duplicative reporting requirements.  1.4. The proposal/initiative relates to:  ¨ a new action  ¨ a new action following a pilot project / preparatory action 26  ¨ the extension of an existing action  þ a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action  1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative  1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative  With this proposal, the Commission proposes a Directive amending Directives (EU) 2022/2464 and (EU) 2024/1760. Once the co-legislators will have reached an agreement on the contents of the proposal, Member States will have a certain period of time to transpose the amendments introduced by this Directive with respect to postponing the date as from which certain groups of companies have to apply with these Directives into their national law. Under this proposal, this transposition deadline is set at 31 December 2025. This proposal also seeks to delay the transposition deadline of the Directive (EU) 2024/1760 by one year. As a result, Member States would be required to transpose the CSDDD by 26 July 2027 at the latest.  In a separate legislative proposal, the Commission proposes to amend a number of provisions of Directives 2006/43/EC, 2013/34/EU, (EU) 2022/2464 and (EU) 2024/1760. The Commission also proposes to revise Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2772 (European Sustainability Reporting Standards). The Commission will adopt the revised ESRS delegated act in time for those undertakings in the second wave that would be required to start reporting under the CSRD in 2028 for financial year 2027 to apply the revised standards.  To monitor progress towards achieving the proposal’s specific objectives, the Commission will explore the possibility of organising exchanges with stakeholders in different formats as well as periodic surveys of users of sustainability information and of undertakings that report such information, depending on the availability of financial resources. Article 6 of the CSRD requires the Commission to present a report on the implementation if the Directive by April 2029. The implementation of the CSDDD as amended, and its effectiveness in reaching its objectives, in particular in addressing adverse impacts, will also be subject to regular evaluation according to Article 36 of that Directive. This proposal does not require an implementation plan.  1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, greater effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this section 'added value of EU involvement' is the value resulting from EU action, that is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.  The Accounting Directive, as amended by the CSRD, already regulates the disclosure of sustainability information in the EU. Common rules on sustainability reporting and its assurance ensure a level playing field for companies established in the different Member States. Significant differences in requirements for sustainability reporting and assurance between Member States would create additional costs and complexity for companies operating across borders, which would be detrimental to the single market. Member States acting alone are not able to modify existing EU laws to reduce the burden on companies.  Similarly, the CSDDD already sets out a harmonised regulatory framework for corporate sustainability due diligence, and also covers certain third-country companies active in the EU market, ensuring level playing field in this policy area.  1.5.3.

Heading(s) of the multiannual financial framework and expenditure budget line(s) affected  N/A  4. Digital dimensions  4.1. Requirements of digital relevance  Table: Row 1 — The reporting requirements introduced by Directive 2013/34/EU require companies to collect and report data concerning their impacts, risks and opportunities as regards material sustainability matters. This exercise entails significant data identification, collection, processing, verification and publication. In order to collect the relevant data, undertakings often use digital data collection and data sharing platforms. Additionally, in order to store and process the data for the purposes of sustainability reporting companies also often utilise digital data management tools. Users of sustainability information increasingly expect such information to be accessible, comparable and machine-readable in digital formats. Member States must require that undertakings subject to the sustainability reporting requirements of Directive 2013/34/EU make their management reports available on their websites, free of charge to the public. Digitalisation creates opportunities to exploit information more efficiently and holds the potential for significant cost savings for both users and undertakings. Digitalisation also enables the centralisation at Union and Member State level of data in an open and accessible format that facilitates reading and allows for the comparison of data. These requirements also complement the creation of a European single access point (ESAP) for public corporate information. As regards specific requirements within the Directive which are of digital relevance, please see below. Directive 2013/34/EU requires undertakings subject to sustainability reporting to prepare their management report in the electronic reporting format specified in Article 3 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 (ESEF Delegated Regulation). It also requires these undertakings to mark up their sustainability reporting, including the disclosures required by Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852, in accordance with the digital taxonomy to be adopted by the Commission by way of an amendment to  the ESEF Delegated Regulation. A digital taxonomy for the Union sustainability reporting standards will allow sustainability reporting to be tagged and to be machine-readable. Until the adoption of this digital taxonomy, undertakings are not required to mark-up their sustainability statements. Considering that the sustainability statement will become machine-readable only once it is both included in an XHTML document and marked-up with a digital taxonomy, pending the adoption of the digital taxonomy undertakings are also not required to prepare the management report in XHTML. Stakeholders affected by these requirements include undertakings required to prepare and publish a sustainability statement which has been digitally tagged and provided in an XHTML format, as well as assurance providers who must verify that the sustainability statement meets the necessary requirements. The current proposal does not modify the existing digital tagging or format rules introduced by the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, which will enhance digital reporting and enable the use of artificial intelligence in utilising the information that undertakings report. As regards the CSDDD, digital tools and technologies could support and reduce the cost of data gathering and assessment. This proposal does not amend the relevant provisions of the CSDDD.  4.2. Data  Table: Row 1 — See section above.  4.3. Digital solutions  Table: Row 1 — See section above.  4.4. Interoperability assessment  Table: Row 1 — N/A  4.5. Measures to support digital implementation  Table: Row 1 — To facilitate the smooth implementation of the requirements of digital relevance identified in Section 4.1., the Commission is involved in a number of initiatives. Firstly, a digital taxonomy for the Union sustainability reporting standards will be necessary to allow the reported information to be tagged in accordance with those sustainability reporting standards. The Commission will adopt a digital taxonomy for the tagging of sustainability information via a Delegated Act, after having received technical advice from ESMA. Secondly, in the framework of the 2025 Technical Support Instrument round, the Commission intends to launch a flagship multi-country project entitled ""Improving Sustainability Reporting for Businesses."" This initiative aims to enhance the capacity of Member States to support companies, particularly SMEs, in implementing CSRD and EU Taxonomy reporting requirements. The support under this initiative will take into account the evolution of the reporting requirements, and it will also be relevant for non-listed SMEs that are not subject to mandatory reporting but face growing demands for sustainability information from their financial and value chain partners. Thirdly, EFRAG has launched an SME forum in which they bring together relevant stakeholders of the SME community to discuss the implementation of the sustainability reporting requirements and how digital solutions and tools can be used to facilitate sustainability reporting for SMEs. As regards the CSDDD, in order to help companies fulfil their due diligence obligations along their value chain, the Directive encourages the use of digital tools and technologies and requires the Commission to issue guidelines with useful information and references to appropriate resources. This proposal does not amend the relevant provisions.",['https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-10-2025-0064_EN.html'],"European Parliament legislative resolution of 3 April 2025 on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directives (EU) 2022/2464 and (EU) 2024/1760 as regards the dates from which Member States are to apply certain corporate sustainability reporting and due diligence requirements ( COM(2025)0080 – C10-0038/2025 – 2025/0044(COD) )

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 50 and 114 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee(1),
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure(2),
Whereas:
(1) In its communication of 11 February 2025 entitled ‘A simpler and faster Europe: Communication on implementation and simplification’, the Commission set out a vision for an implementation and simplification agenda that delivers fast and visible improvements for people and business on the ground. That requires more than an incremental approach and the Union is to take bold action to achieve that goal. The European Parliament, the Council, the Commission, the authorities of the Member States at all levels and stakeholders need to work together to streamline and simplify Union, national and regional rules and to implement policies more effectively.
(2) In the context of the Commission’s commitment to reducing reporting burdens and to enhancing competitiveness, it is necessary to introduce targeted amendments to Directives (EU) 2022/2464(3)and (EU) 2024/1760(4)of the European Parliament and of the Council in order to achieve those objectives, whilst maintaining the policy objectives of the Green Deal as set out in the Commission’s communication of 11 December 2019 entitled ‘The European Green Deal’ and the Sustainable Finance Action Plan as set out in the Commission’s communication of 8 March 2018 entitled ‘Action Plan: Financing Sustainable Growth’.
(3) Directive (EU) 2022/2464 specifies the dates from which Member States are to apply the sustainability reporting requirements set out in Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council(5), with different dates depending on the size of the undertaking concerned. Large undertakings that are public-interest entities with more than 500 employees on average during the financial year and public-interest entities that are parent undertakings of a large group with more than 500 employees on average on its balance sheet dates, on a consolidated basis, during the financial year are to report in 2025 for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2024. Other large undertakings and other parent undertakings of a large group are to report in 2026 for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2025. Small and medium-sized undertakings, except micro-undertakings, small and non-complex institutions, captive insurance undertakings and captive reinsurance undertakings are to report in 2027 for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2026. Considering the ongoing Commission initiatives which aim to simplify certain existing sustainability reporting obligations and to reduce the related administrative burden on undertakings, and in order to provide for legal clarity and to avoid the undertakings currently required to report for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2025 and on or after 1 January 2026 incurring unnecessary and avoidable costs, the sustainability reporting requirements for those undertakings should be postponed by two years.
(4) Directive (EU) 2022/2464 specifies the dates from which Member States are to apply the sustainability reporting requirements set out in Directive 2004/109/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(6), with different dates depending on the size of the issuer concerned. Issuers that are large undertakings with more than 500 employees on average during the financial year and issuers that are parent undertakings of a large group with more than 500 employees on average on its balance sheet dates, on a consolidated basis, during the financial year are to report in 2025 for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2024. Other issuers that are large undertakings and other issuers that are parent undertakings of a large group are to report in 2026 for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2025. Issuers that are small and medium-sized undertakings, except micro-undertakings, small and non-complex institutions, captive insurance undertakings and captive reinsurance undertakings are to report in 2027 for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2026. Considering the ongoing Commission initiatives which aim to simplify certain existing sustainability reporting obligations and to reduce the related administrative burden on undertakings, and in order to provide for legal clarity and to avoid the issuers currently required to report for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2025 and on or after 1 January 2026 incurring unnecessary and avoidable costs, the sustainability reporting requirements for those issuers should be postponed by two years.
(5) The date from which Member States are to apply Directive (EU) 2024/1760 should be postponed by one year for the first set of companies that fall within the scope of that Directive in order to give companies more time to prepare for the requirements of that Directive and to provide them with the opportunity to take into account the guidelines to be issued by the Commission on how they should fulfil their due diligence obligations in a practical manner. Furthermore, the application date of 1 January 2029 for the measures necessary to comply with the reporting obligation pursuant to Article 16 of Directive (EU) 2024/1760 regarding the third set of companies that fall within the scope of that Directive should be amended in order to ensure coherence with the respective application dates for the other sets of companies.
(6) Moreover, in the light of a parallel legislative proposal which aims to simplify the sustainability framework and reduce the burden on companies, the deadline for the Member States to transpose Directive (EU) 2024/1760 should be extended by one year in order to take into account possible delays in their ongoing transposition efforts due to possible amendments to that Directive.
(7) Since the objectives of this Directive cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
(8) Directives (EU) 2022/2464 and (EU) 2024/1760 should therefore be amended accordingly. Since the amendment to Directive (EU) 2024/1760 alters the transposition deadline and certain dates of application, all of which fall in the future, Member States would only need to postpone the application dates pursuant to Article 2 of this Directive in the event that they have already transposed Directive (EU) 2024/1760.
(9) In view of the urgency of the matter and to provide legal certainty as soon as possible, it is considered to be appropriate to invoke the exception to the eight-week period provided for in Article 4 of Protocol No 1 on the role of national Parliaments in the European Union, annexed to the Treaty on European Union, to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community.
(10) For reasons of urgency and to provide legal certainty as soon as possible, this Directive should enter into force on the day following that of its publication in theOfficial Journal of the European Union,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:

Article 5

This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
Done at Brussels, 14 April 2025.",https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202500794,"The European Commission has proposed a directive to amend existing legislation on corporate sustainability reporting and due diligence, focusing on adjusting the application dates for these regulations. This initiative aims to simplify regulatory frameworks and reduce administrative burdens, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The proposal is part of a broader effort to enhance competitiveness amid economic and geopolitical challenges, such as rising energy prices and trade tensions.

Central to this proposal are the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD). The CSRD, effective since January 2023, requires companies to disclose their sustainability impacts, aiding investors and stakeholders in understanding risks related to climate change and other sustainability issues. The CSDDD, adopted in June 2024, mandates companies to address adverse human rights and environmental impacts within their operations and supply chains.

To help EU companies maintain competitiveness and adapt to the global landscape, the proposal seeks to delay the implementation of certain CSRD and CSDDD provisions. This phased implementation requires large public interest entities to start reporting in 2025, with other companies following in subsequent years. Additionally, the proposal involves developing European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) to guide these requirements.

The directive aims to postpone the application date for the first group of companies under the CSDDD by one year, allowing more time for preparation and the opportunity to consider guidelines on fulfilling due diligence obligations. Furthermore, the deadline for member states to transpose the CSDDD is extended by one year.

Digitalisation","The European Parliament and the Council have adopted a directive aimed at revising corporate sustainability reporting and due diligence requirements across the EU. This directive, effective from April 14, 2025, simplifies obligations for businesses by adjusting implementation dates and reducing administrative burdens. Large companies and public-interest entities will begin reporting in 2027 for financial years starting in 2026, while smaller companies will report in 2028 for financial years beginning in 2027. New due diligence requirements are postponed by one year, allowing companies more time to adapt. The directive specifies that certain large companies, both EU-based and those formed in third countries, must comply with specific measures from July 26, 2028, with some exceptions applying from January 1, 2029. Other companies will follow from July 26, 2029, with certain measures starting January 1, 2030. Member States are required to implement the necessary laws by December 31, 2025, and inform the Commission. The directive emphasizes the EU's commitment to achieving its objectives effectively, adhering to principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, and will enter into force the day after its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union."

1.4.2025  COM(2025) 136 final  2025/0070(COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulation (EU) 2019/631 to include an additional flexibility as regards the calculation of manufacturers’ compliance with CO2 emission performance standards for new passenger cars and new light commercial vehicles for the calendar years 2025 to 2027  (Text with EEA relevance)  EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM  1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  Regulation (EU) 2019/631 1 sets CO 2 emission performance standards for new passenger cars and light commercial vehicles . It is a key contribut ion to achieve the objective s set in the EU climate law, including the 2050 climate neutrality and the 2030 target to reduce economy-wide CO 2 emissions by 55% compared to 1990.  The automotive industry is of key importance for the EU economy and accounts for over 7% of the EU's GDP. It provides jobs - directly or indirectly, in manufacturing, sales, maintenance, construction and transport and transport services - to around 13 million Europeans. The automotive sector is undergoing a structural transformation including changes in clean and digital technologies, in particular the shift towards zero-emission vehicles. The CO 2 standards provide long-term certainty and predictability for investors along the value chain, therefore enabling such sectoral transformation, while allowing sufficient lead time for a fair transition.  The regulation requires that the annual EU fleet-wide average CO 2 emissions from new cars and new vans are reduced in five-year intervals. In 2025, a target of 15% reduction of CO 2 compared to 2021 values starts applying in each year for the 2025–2029 period.  Each year, the average CO 2 emissions and the specific CO 2 emissions target for each manufacturer are established, based on the EU fleet-wide target, in order to evaluate the manufacturers’ performance in complying with their targets. Manufacturers exceeding their specific emissions target pay an excess emission premium of €95 per g/km for each new vehicle registered.  I n the context of the Strategic Dialogue on the Future of the Automotive Industry that took place in Q1 2025 and as announced in the Commission Automotive Action Plan of 5 March 2025, the proposal concerns a targeted change of the Regulation (EU) 2019/631 to provide manufacturers with an additional flexibility as regards their compliance obligations , by provid ing for a three-year compliance period for 2025, 2026 and 2027 , instead of an annual period .  The targeted amendment introduces such additional flexibility for manufacturers while maintaining the level of ambition of the emissions reduction target.  To maintain regulatory certainty and predictability, it is essential that this one-off flexibility to allow compliance over a three-year compliance period is agreed between the European Parliament and Council swiftly and without delay.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  This proposal does not amend the substantive rules of Regulation (EU) 2019/631 and it maintains the targets. The proposal responds to concerns expressed in the EU by the automotive sector, by providing an additional flexibility for manufacturers to comply with the objectives of the Regulation.  • Consistency with other Union policies  The European Climate Law Regulation 2 establishes the framework for achieving climate neutrality within the EU by 2050. The regulation requires the reduction of net EU greenhouse-gas emissions by at least 55% (compared to 1990 levels) by 2030. It requires the Commission to propose a 2040 target. In line with the EU Climate Law reduction targets, Regulation (EU) 2019/631 sets emission reduction target s for cars and vans.  The current proposal does not change the reduction targets and does not lower the overall CO 2 emission standards ambitions. By introducing a one-off three-year compliance period for 2025, 2026 and 2027 instead of annual assessment, it allows an additional flexibility for vehicles manufacturers, while keeping the certainty and predictability for investors along the value chain.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  The legal basis for this proposal is Article 192 of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). In accordance with Article 191 and 192(1) TFEU, the European Union shall contribute to the pursuit, inter alia, of the following objectives: preserving, protecting and improving the quality of the environment; promoting measures at international level to deal with regional or worldwide environmental problems, and in particular combating climate change. Based on Article 192 of the TFEU, the Union has already adopted policies to address CO 2 emissions from cars and light commercial vehicles beginning with Regulation (EC) 443/2009 3 and Regulation (EU) 510/2011 4 .  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  This initiative is consistent with the principle of subsidiarity. Amendment of Regulation (EU) 2019/631 to provide this additional flexibility cannot be achieved by the Member States themselves.  • Proportionality  The proposal is consistent with the principle of proportionality, because it does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the Union’s objectives of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in a cost-effective manner, while providing vehicles manufacturers with a one-off additional flexibility for their compliance while maintaining the level of ambition of the targets.  • Choice of the instrument  The proposal amends Regulation (EU) 2019/631 only as regards providing an additional flexibility on the compliance periods. Thus, it should follow the same form of act, i.e. a regulation.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  No evaluation is necessary for the proposal, since it only provides for a new and temporary flexibility for vehicles manufacturers to comply with the targets.  • Stakeholder consultations  The Commission held intense and extensive discussions with manufacturers and stakeholders from the automotive value chain in the context of the Strategic Dialogue on the Future of the Automotive Industry that took place in Q1 2025.  • Collection and use of expertise  The proposal has been elaborated following a process of internal scrutiny of existing obligations and is based on experience in implementing the related legislation, including the annual monitoring process of manufacturers’ CO 2 compliance.  • Impact assessment  The proposal concerns targeted changes of Regulation (EU) 2019/631 to provide manufacturers with an additional flexibility as regards their compliance obligations. It does not change the level of ambition of the targets.  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  Compared to the current Regulation, the proposal is not expected to increase administrative costs. In addition, it is not increasing the complexity of the legal framework.  • Fundamental rights  The proposal respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union 5 . In particular, it contributes to the objective of a high level of environmental protection in accordance with the principle of sustainable development as laid down in Article 37 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  The legislative financial statement setting out the implications for budgetary, human and administrative resources was attached to the proposal which led to the adoption of Regulation (EU) 2019/631 and its latest revision by Regulation (EU) 2023/851.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  This proposal does not change the substance of the rules, the implementation assessment remains the same as of the proposal which led to the adoption of Regulation (EU) 2019/631, as amended by Regulation (EU) 2023/851.  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  Article 1(1) amends Article 4 in order to specify the three-year compliance period.  Article 1(2) amends Article 6 to specify that the pooling agreements for 2025-2027 should be communicated to the Commission by end of 2027.  Article 1(3) amends Article 8 to specify the rules on imposing the excess emissions premiums for the three-year compliance period 2025-2027.  2025/0070 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulation (EU) 2019/631 to include an additional flexibility as regards the calculation of manufacturers’ compliance with CO 2 emission performance standards for new passenger cars and new light commercial vehicles for the calendar years 2025 to 2027  (Text with EEA relevance)  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192(1) thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 6 ,  Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions 7 ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) Regulation (EU) 2019/631 of the European Parliament and of the Council 8 sets out the CO 2 targets for new passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, that form a key part of the U nion framework to reduc e by 2030 net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 % below 1990 levels and reach economy-wide climate-neutrality by 2050.  (2) In response to the request of stakeholders for an additional compliance flexibility on CO 2 targets as regards the period 2025 to 2027 , i t is appropriate to urgently adopt an amend ment to allow a one-off flexibility for those three years in the calculation of the compliance with the CO 2 emission performance standards , while maintain ing the targets for reducing CO 2 emissions .  (3) During the period 2025 to 2027, manufacturers should ensure that the average specific emissions of CO 2 of their vehicles do not exceed an emissions target, calculated as the average of their annual specific emissions targets over the period. Compliance with the targets should be assessed at the end of the three-year period for each individual manufacturer. The excess emission premiums should be calculated accordingly.  (4) In order t o align the pooling provisions with the additional compliance flexibility in the years 2025 to 2027 , it should be possible to enter into pooling agreements for each of th os e three years until the end of 2027 .  (5) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely to provide additional flexibility for the CO 2 compliance in the period 2025 to 2027 while preserving the CO 2 emissions reduction requirements for both new passenger cars and new light commercial vehicles , cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but can rather, by reason of t heir scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.  (6) Regulation (EU) 2019/631 should therefore be amended accordingly,  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Article 1  Regulation (EU) 2019/631 is amended as follows:  (1) in Article 4 , the following paragraph is added:  ‘1a. By way of derogation from paragraph 1, for the three-year period comprising the calendar years 2025 to 2027, a manufacturer, including when it is a member of a pool, shall ensure that its average specific emissions of CO 2 over that period do not exceed its specific emissions target over that period.  Those average specific emissions of CO 2 shall be calculated as the average over the three-year period of the annual average specific emissions of CO 2 weighted according to the number of newly registered vehicles for the manufacturer in each calendar year.  The specific emissions target shall be calculated as the average over the three-year period of the annual specific emissions targets determined in accordance with point 6.3 of Part A or Part B of Annex I or, where a manufacturer is granted a derogation under Article 10, in accordance with that derogation, weighted according to the number of newly registered vehicles for the manufacturer in each calendar year.  For each calendar year when a manufacturer was included in a pool, the annual average specific emissions of CO 2 and the annual specific emissions target to be used for those calculations shall be the values for that pool.’;  (2) in Article 6 , in paragraph 2, the following subparagraph is added :  ‘By way of derogation from the first subparagraph, an agreement to form a pool covering the calendar years 2025 or 2026 may be entered into up to 31 December 2027.’;  (3) in Article 8 , in paragraph 1, the following sub paragraph is added :  ‘By way of derogation from the first subparagraph, with respect to the calendar years 2025 to 2027, the Commission shall impose an excess emissions premium on any manufacturer whose average specific emissions of CO 2 over those three years exceed its specific emissions target over the period 2025 to 2027.’.  Article 2  This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union .  This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.

FRAMEWORK OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE  1.1. Title of the proposal/initiative  Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) 2019/631 to include an additional flexibility as regards the calculation of manufacturers’ compliance with CO2 emission performance standards for new passenger cars and new light commercial vehicles for the calendar years 2025 to 2027.  1.2. Policy area(s) concerned  Climate policy  1.3. Objective(s)  1.3.1. General objective(s)  The CO 2 standards provide long-term certainty and predictability for investors along the automotive value chain, while allowing sufficient lead time for a fair transition. The amending proposal aims at providing additional flexibility for manufacturers to comply with the 2025 CO 2 target, while leaving the level of ambition unchanged.  1.3.2. Specific objective(s)  The proposal concerns targeted changes of the CO 2 cars and vans Regulation to provide manufacturers with an additional flexibility: it provides for a three-year instead of an annual compliance period, for 2025, 2026 and 2027 combined.  1.3.3. Expected result(s) and impact  Specify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.  The amendment, if adopted, would determine that compliance is assessed over the years of 2025, 2026 and 2027 combined to allow car manufacturers to compensate an exceedance of the target in one or two of these years by overachievements in the other year(s).  1.3.4. Indicators of performance  Specify the indicators for monitoring progress and achievements.  Monitor the CO 2 compliance of manufacturers over the three years period.  1.4. The proposal/initiative relates to:   a new action   a new action following a pilot project / preparatory action 9   the extension of an existing action   a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action  1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative  1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative  The amending proposal aims at providing additional flexibility for manufacturers to comply with the CO 2 targets, while maintaining overall ambition on the CO 2 reduction targets over the period 2025-2029.  1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, greater effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this section 'added value of EU involvement' is the value resulting from EU action, that is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.  Climate change is a trans-boundary problem, which cannot be solved by national or local action alone. Coordination of climate action must be taken at European level  and EU action is justified on grounds of subsidiarity. Given the need to modify Regulation (EU) 2019/631 by providing an additional flexibility as regards the compliance periods, the objectives of this initiative cannot be achieved by the Member States themselves.  1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past  The proposal builds on existing legislation which has ensured continuous reductions in the CO 2 emissions of the EU fleet of new cars and light commercial vehicles over the past decade.  1.5.4. Compatibility with the multiannual financial framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments  No additional resources required.  1.5.5. Assessment of the different available financing options, including scope for redeployment  No additional resources required.  1.6. Duration of the proposal/initiative and of its financial impact   limited duration  –  in effect from [DD/MM]YYYY to [DD/MM]YYYY  –  financial impact from YYYY to YYYY for commitment appropriations and from YYYY to YYYY for payment appropriations.   unlimited duration  – Implementation with a start-up period from YYYY to YYYY,  – followed by full-scale operation.  1.7. Method(s) of budget implementation planned 10   Direct management by the Commission  –  by its departments, including by its staff in the Union delegations;  –  by the executive agencies   Shared management with the Member States   Indirect management by entrusting budget implementation tasks to:  –  third countries or the bodies they have designated  –  international organisations and their agencies (to be specified)  –  the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund  –  bodies referred to in Articles 70 and 71 of the Financial Regulation  –  public law bodies  –  bodies governed by private law with a public service mission to the extent that they are provided with adequate financial guarantees  –  bodies governed by the private law of a Member State that are entrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership and that are provided with adequate financial guarantees  –  bodies or persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in the common foreign and security policy pursuant to Title V of the Treaty on European Union, and identified in the relevant basic act  –   bodies established in a Member State, governed by the private law of a Member State or Union law and eligible to be entrusted, in accordance with sector-specific rules, with the implementation of Union funds or budgetary guarantees, to the extent that such bodies are controlled by public law bodies or by bodies governed by private law with a public service mission, and are provided with adequate financial guarantees in the form of joint and several liability by the controlling bodies or equivalent financial guarantees and which may be, for each action, limited to the maximum amount of the Union support.  Comments  No additional resources required.  2. MANAGEMENT MEASURES  2.1. Monitoring and reporting rules  No change to the monitoring and reporting rules is introduced, since the current system also allows to monitor the application of the proposed additional fexibility.  2.2. Management and control system(s)  2.2.1. Justification of the budget implementation method(s), the funding implementation mechanism(s), the payment modalities and the control strategy proposed  The proposal is not implementing a financial programme but introducing an additional flexibility for 2025-2027 in terms of compliance by the light-duty vehicles manufacturers with CO 2 emissions targets. Management mode, funding implementation mechanisms, payment modalities and control strategy in relation to error rates are not applicable.  2.2.2. Information concerning the risks identified and the internal control system(s) set up to mitigate them  This proposal does not concern a spending programme. Efficient monitoring of vehicle registration data is essential for ensuring legal certainty in enforcing the legislation and for ensuring level playing field between different manufacturers.  2.2.3. Estimation and justification of the cost-effectiveness of the controls (ratio between the control costs  and the value of the related funds managed), and assessment of the expected levels of risk of error (at payment & at closure)  This initiative does not bring about new significant controls/risks that would not be covered be an existing internal control framework. No specific measures beyond the application of the Financial Regulation have been envisaged.  2.3. Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities  In addition to the application of the Financial Regulation to prevent fraud and irregularities, the additional flexibility for compliance with the CO 2 reduction requirements provided for in this proposal will be accompanied by monitoring and reporting of different datasets as provided for in Regulation (EU) 2019/631.  3.

of 17 June 2025
amending Regulation (EU) 2019/631 to include an additional flexibility as regards the calculation of manufacturers’ compliance with CO2emission performance standards for new passenger cars and new light commercial vehicles for the calendar years 2025 to 2027
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192(1) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee(1),
After consulting the Committee of the Regions,
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure(2),
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EU) 2019/631 of the European Parliament and of the Council(3)sets the CO2emission performance standards for new passenger cars and new light commercial vehicles that form a key part of the Union framework to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 % compared to 1990 levels by 2030 and to achieve economy-wide climate-neutrality by 2050.
(2) In response to a request from stakeholders for additional compliance flexibility on CO2targets as regards the period 2025 to 2027, it is appropriate to urgently adopt an amendment that provides for a one-off flexibility for those three years in respect of calculating compliance with CO2emission performance standards, while maintaining the targets for reducing CO2emissions.
(3) During the period 2025 to 2027, manufacturers should ensure that the average specific emissions of CO2of their vehicles do not exceed an emissions target, calculated as the average of their annual specific emissions targets over that period. Compliance with those targets should be assessed at the end of the three-year period for each individual manufacturer. The excess emission premiums should be calculated accordingly.
(4) In order to align the pooling provisions with the additional compliance flexibility in the years 2025 to 2027, it should be possible to enter into pooling agreements for the calendar year 2025 or 2026 until the end of 2027.
(5) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely to provide additional flexibility for the CO2compliance in the period 2025 to 2027 while preserving the CO2emissions reduction requirements for both new passenger cars and new light commercial vehicles, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but can rather, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.
(6) In view of the urgency to provide an additional flexibility for the CO2compliance in the period 2025 to 2027 while preserving the CO2emissions reduction requirements for both new passenger cars and new light commercial vehicles, it is considered to be appropriate to invoke the exception to the eight-week period provided for in Article 4 of Protocol No 1 on the role of national Parliaments in the European Union, annexed to the Treaty on European Union, to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community.
(7) Regulation (EU) 2019/631 should therefore be amended accordingly,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

Article 1

Regulation (EU) 2019/631 is amended as follows:
(1) in Article 4, the following paragraph is inserted:‘1a.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, for the three-year period comprising the calendar years 2025 to 2027, a manufacturer, including when it is a member of a pool, shall ensure that its average specific emissions of CO2over that period do not exceed its specific emissions target over that period.Those average specific emissions of CO2shall be calculated as the average over the three-year period of the annual average specific emissions of CO2weighted according to the number of newly registered vehicles for the manufacturer in each calendar year.The specific emissions target shall be calculated as the average over the three-year period of the annual specific emissions targets determined in accordance with point 6.3 of Part A or Part B of Annex I or, where a manufacturer is granted a derogation under Article 10, in accordance with that derogation, weighted according to the number of newly registered vehicles for the manufacturer in each calendar year.For each calendar year in which a manufacturer was included in a pool, the annual average specific emissions of CO2and the annual specific emissions target to be used for those calculations shall be the values for that pool.’;
(2) in Article 6(2), the following subparagraph is added:‘By way of derogation from the first subparagraph, an agreement to form a pool covering the calendar year 2025 or 2026 may be entered into up to 31 December 2027.’;
(3) in Article 8(1), the following subparagraph is added:‘By way of derogation from the first subparagraph, with respect to the calendar years 2025 to 2027, the Commission shall impose an excess emissions premium on any manufacturer whose average specific emissions of CO2over those three years exceed its specific emissions target over the period 2025 to 2027.’.

Article 2

This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in theOfficial Journal of the European Union.
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.
Done at Strasbourg, 17 June 2025.",https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202501214,,"The European Parliament and the Council have adopted a regulation granting car manufacturers additional flexibility in meeting CO2 emission performance standards for new passenger cars and light commercial vehicles from 2025 to 2027. This regulation allows manufacturers to calculate their compliance with emission targets over this three-year period as an average, rather than annually, offering a one-off flexibility while maintaining overall emission reduction goals. Manufacturers must ensure that their average CO2 emissions do not exceed their calculated targets over these years. Additionally, the regulation permits pooling agreements, which allow manufacturers to combine their emissions data to meet targets, to be formed for the years 2025 or 2026 until the end of 2027. Excess emissions beyond the set targets during this period will result in penalties. This measure aims to balance the need for flexibility with the commitment to reducing emissions, addressing stakeholder requests while ensuring that the broader environmental objectives are met. The regulation will become effective on the twentieth day after its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union and will be directly applicable in all EU member states."

PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 as regards a shorter settlement cycle in the Union  (Text with EEA relevance)  {SWD(2025) 37 final}  EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM  1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  The EU needs to do more to unlock the financing necessary to finance the digital, green and social transition as well as to boost growth. Efficiently functioning and deep capital markets are a necessary condition for achieving that goal. However, EU capital markets remain fragmented despite substantial efforts to integrate them over the years; this fragmentation is a substantial impediment to their development. This has been confirmed by a number of reports during 2024 including the Draghi report 1 , and the Letta report 2 . These reports also underline that the competitiveness and attractiveness of EU capital markets, and their ability to deliver the financing that the EU needs, can only be achieved if those markets embrace innovation.  The Savings and Investments Union needs to be built on efficient and safe post-trade services. These services play a key role, amongst other things, in the issuance of securities, finalisation of trades (settlement), keeping track of the ownership of securities as well as managing and reducing risks (clearing). Post-trade services are essential for the functioning of EU capital markets. For these reasons, all aforementioned reports have emphasised that more needs to be done to improve the efficiency of post-trade services.  Each day, more than EUR 4 trillion of securities 3 are settled in EU central securities depositorie s (CSDs) . The longer settlement takes ( i ) the longer the r isks 4 faced by buyers and sellers last ; (ii) the longer investors have to wait to receive the money or the securities they are owed – if the settlement doesn’t fail ; and (iii) the more that opportunities to enter in other transactions are reduced . Fast, efficient and reliable settlement is therefore an essential pre-condition for developing the Savings and Investments Union .  It has now been ten years since the Central Securities Depositories Regulation (CSDR) 5 entered into force and harmonised the securities settlement cycle in the EU at a maximum of two business days after the trade date (so-called ‘T+2’) for certain secondary markets transactions. 6 Since then, financial markets and technology have continued to evolve. Following the EU move at the end of 2014, many jurisdictions followed and moved to shorter settlement; for example, the US moved to T+2 in 2017. But innovation and the need to improve the efficiency of settlement, to increase competitiveness as well as to reduce risks to financial stability, have meant that efforts have not stopped there. The rest of the world has moved on since then: for instance China, India, the United States and Canada, have all shortened settlement to a maximum of one business day after the trade date (so-called ‘T+1’) . Significantly, the global shift to T+1 is creating misalignments between EU and global financial markets and creates potential competitiveness gaps for EU capital markets. These misalignments will only increase the more countries will move to T+1.  The most recent review of the CSDR recognised these trends and mandated the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), in close cooperation with the members of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB), to assess the appropriateness of shortening the settlement cycle in the EU and present a roadmap for how such a move could be carried out. ESMA published its report (ESMA Report) on 18 November 2024 7 , recommending that the EU move to T+1 no later than 11 October 2027. 8  Shortening the settlement cycle in the EU would significantly change the way in which markets function today, with different impacts depending on the type of stakeholder, the category of transaction and the type of security. Quantifying some of the costs and benefits related to the shortening of the settlement cycle in the EU is challenging because of the lack of data, but the elements assessed by ESMA suggest that the benefits of a move in terms of risk reduction, margin savings 9 and the reduction of costs incurred because of inefficiencies stemming from the misalignment with other major jurisdictions globally, represent important benefits for the S avings and I nvestments U nion . Moreover, investment in modernising , harmonising and improving the efficiency and resilience of post-trade processes that would be prompted by a move to T+1 would facilitate achieving the objective of further promoting settlement efficiency in the EU, promoting market integration and ultimately the Savings and Investments Union , and avoiding a competitive disadvantage for EU capital markets, which could see traders favour other, more efficient markets. Finally, maintaining the current settlement cycle in the EU would contribute to further fragmenting the S avings and I nvestments U nion as different EU stakeholders would continue to implement divergent solutions to cope with shorter settlement in most of the world’s capital markets.  Most of the identified costs associated with a move to T+1 would manifest in the short term, and are related to the investments needed to modernise, standardise and digitalise various steps in the settlement process. On the other hand, the elements assessed by ESMA suggest that the impact of T+1 in terms of risk reduction, margin savings and the reduction of costs linked to the misalignment with other major jurisdictions globally, represent important benefits for the competitiveness of EU capital markets and for moving towards the Savings and Investments Union and would ultimately improve the efficiency of EU capital markets and hence maintain their competitiveness at global level. 10  Settling securities transactions on T+1 is already technically and legally possible in the EU. Hence a move to T+1 could be left entirely in the hands of the EU securities industry to coordinate and carry out. However, the higher level of complexity of EU financial markets - due to the number of different actors, systems and currencies involved - compared to other jurisdictions that already moved to T+1, would make coordinating the process extremely challenging for that industry and would not provide legal or even planning certainty.  These aspects have also been highlighted in the Joint Statement by ESMA, the Commission and the ECB on shortening the standard securities settlement cycle in the EU, published on 15 October 2024 (‘Joint Statement’) 11 . The Joint Statement pointed out the need for the EU to urgently act through a coordinated approach if it wants to avoid prolonging and amplifying the negative impacts of the misalignment in settlement cycles with major jurisdictions internationally and ensure an efficient and competitive S avings and I nvestment U nion .  Therefore, this proposal aims to ensure that all stakeholders have sufficient time to prepare and move to T+1 in a coordinated and timely manner.  It is hence proposed that the EU move to a shorter settlement cycle requiring the settlement of transactions that are currently subject to a settlement cycle in T+2 to take place at the latest on the first business day after the trading takes place. This would not prevent CSDs that are already technologically capable to do so, to voluntarily settle transactions on the same date as the trade date.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  The proposal is to amend CSDR by introducing a T+1 settlement cycle in the European Union, to improve the efficiency of settlement with the aim of increasing competitiveness and reducing risks to financial stability. The proposed legislative changes would contribute to the development of a more efficient post-trading landscape in the EU, in line with the objectives set out under CSDR Refit 12 . Moreover, this proposal is in line with the Commission’s objective of building a Savings and Investments Union, to facilitate capital flow across the EU to the benefit of consumers, investors and companies. The settlement of securities is at the core of capital markets. Fast, efficient and reliable settlement is therefore an essential pre-condition for developing the Savings and Investments Union. A shorter settlement cycle would enhance the attractiveness of EU markets and unlock important benefits, notably by achieving risk reduction, margin savings and the reduction of costs linked to misalignment with other major jurisdictions globally .  • Consistency with other Union policies  This initiative aims to complement the broader Commission agenda to make EU capital markets more competitive and resilient. A competitive and efficient post-trade environment, of which the settlement cycle is a pivotal feature, is an essential element to achieve the Savings and Investments Union objectives. A fully functioning and integrated market for capital will allow the EU’s economy to grow in a sustainable way and be more competitive, in line with the strategic priorities of the Commission, focused on creating the right conditions for job creation, growth and investment.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  The legal basis for this proposal is Article 114 of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union, which is the legal basis for the CSDR. The main objective of the CSDR is to increase the safety and efficiency of securities settlement and settlement infrastructures in the EU. This initiative proposes to revise the duration of the settlement cycle in the Union, shortening it from two to one business day after the trade, therefore the related legislative proposal would be adopted under the same legal basis.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  According to the principle of subsidiarity provided in Article 5(3) of the Treaty on European Union, action at Union level should be taken only when the aims envisaged cannot be achieved sufficiently by Member States alone and can, because of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved by the EU.  The objectives of the CSDR, namely, to lay down uniform requirements for the settlement of financial instruments in the EU, rules on the organisation and conduct of CSDs and to promote safe, efficient and smooth settlement, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States alone, as the co-legislators acknowledged in 2014 when adopting the CSDR and in 2023 when adopting CSDR Refit.  Notably, the CSDR introduced a requirement for a mandatory settlement period for most transactions in transferable securities executed on a trading venue in the EU, setting this period at two business days after trading takes place. It is then appropriate that the shortening of such settlement period is undertaken through the same legal instrument.  This approach is further supported when considering the fragmentation of the landscape of EU post-trade infrastructures and the differences in the Member States’ capital markets and legal frameworks, which would make a common move to T+1 more challenging, were it not coordinated at EU level. The adoption of diverging practices by EU CSDs and trading venues with respect to the misalignment of global settlement periods would entail complexities and risks, further fragmenting EU capital markets and creating unfavourable conditions for participants and investors. As such, the aim of this initiative to shorten the settlement cycle in the Union and thus remove misalignments with the global economy, in view of strengthening the competitiveness and efficiency of the EU post-trade environment, cannot be sufficiently achieved by Member States alone. Therefore, by reason of the scale of actions, these objectives can be better achieved at EU level in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5(3) of the Treaty on European Union.  • Proportionality  The proposal aims to remove the misalignment between EU and international settlement cycles in a proportionate, effective and efficient manner.  Shortening the settlement cycle would provide a greater alignment with global markets, significantly streamlining processes for all cross-border market participants and would reduce risks and costs for securities listed or traded simultaneously in T+1 jurisdictions and in the EU. Due to the number of different actors, systems and currencies involved in the EU financial market, an entirely autonomous transition to T+1 by the Member States would be challenging, inefficient and more costly. EU level action is necessary to adequately achieve the objective of introducing a shorter settlement cycle in the EU and unlock the related benefits. The proposal does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve its objectives.  • Choice of the instrument  The CSDR is a Regulation and thus it needs to be amended by a legal instrument of the same nature.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  Given the nature and the urgency of the initiative, which relates to a targeted amendment of Article 5(2) of CSDR to introduce a shorter settlement cycle in the Union, and the related preparatory work, the Commission services did not consider it appropriate to conduct an ex-post evaluation of existing legislation. During the preparation of the Staff Working Document accompanying this proposal, the Commission services have analysed the impacts of the targeted amendment in light of international developments and have considered the feedback received by stakeholders and the analysis set out in the ESMA Report.  • Stakeholder consultations  The Commission has consulted stakeholders throughout the process of preparing this proposal. In particular through:  · A roundtable 13 organised by the Commission on 25 January 2024 on moving to a shorter settlement cycle in the EU. Attendees included high-level representatives from a broad range of sectors of the industry (buy-side 14 , sell-side 15 , retail investors, market infrastructures), from leading regulatory authorities, as well as representatives of the European Parliament and European Central Bank. Although a range of views were expressed, the majority of participants supported a legislative change to move to T+1. They acknowledged that although a move to a shorter settlement cycle can bring benefits, notably in the long term, those benefits were difficult to quantify. They were of the view that the short-term benefits would predominantly materialise through a realignment with other jurisdictions, notably the US, and collateral savings, while the main medium- to long-term benefits would be a greater level of automation of the whole settlement chain and the continued competitiveness of EU capital markets. The participants were almost unanimous about the need for coordination between European jurisdictions; there was also a consensus that a misalignment between the EU and the US was not manageable in the long term. An informal poll held at the roundtable on the dates of a potential move showed that the majority (54%) supported a 2027/2028 move, while 34% supported an earlier move and 12% would favour a later move.  · A Member States’ experts meeting held on 5 September 2024, to discuss a potential shortening of the settlement cycle in the EU 16 . The vast majority of Member States expressed their support for shortening the settlement cycle to T+1 and considered that a move to T+1 would lead to more efficient and timely settlement and increase the attractiveness of EU capital markets for investors. Furthermore, they considered that the stability of markets would improve, and liquidity would be more efficiently used due to a reduction of settlement related risks and costs. Member States were also of the view that a move should be signalled through an amendment to the CSDR. They supported a simultaneous move for all financial instruments rather than a phased one. Finally, they stressed that for the move to T+1 to be successful, thorough preparation, including the development of a detailed roadmap, would be essential.  • Collection and use of expertise  In preparing this proposal the Commission relied on external expertise and data from the following sources:  · ESMA :  – the responses to a 3-month call for evidence on shortening the settlement cycle, launched by ESMA on 5 October 2023 to which 81 responses were received . T he feedback received was summarised and published on 21 March 2024 17 ;  – the findings from ESMA’s industry workshop held on 4 December 2023 18 ;  – the findings from ESMA’s public hearing 19 organised on 10 July 2024; and  – t he ESMA report under Article 74(3) of CSDR submitted to the Commission on 18 November 2024.  · Advisory Group on Market Infrastructures for Securities and Collateral (AMI-SeCo) : during its plenary meeting on 26 June 2024, the AMI-SeCo, which advises the Eurosystem on issues related to financial market infrastructures, underlined that there is a need for a process to (i) develop an implementation timetable for an EU move to T+1, (ii) monitor market preparedness and (iii) identify areas where solutions must be developed. A majority of AMI-SeCo participants expressed the view that the EU should not wait for a formal cost-benefit analysis and urged EU decision makers to signal as soon as possible the intention to move as well as a target date for the transition. In addition, the AMI-SECO called for setting up as soon as possible a body to coordinate the move. 20  · European T+1 Task Force: the task force, which includes a wide representation of members from the buy-side, sell-side and market infrastructures 21 , was established in July 2023 by market participants to seek an industry wide agreement and present their views on the impacts of the US transition to T+1 on EU stakeholders and on a potential move to T+1 in the EU. It was set up following a report by the Association for Financial Markets in Europe ( AFME ) on the potential benefits and challenges of moving to T+1 in Europe 22 . The report concluded that many of the benefits and challenges of a US migration to T+1 would also be applicable to European markets. However, given the nature of European markets which, in comparison to the US, have a multitude of currencies, market infrastructures, and actors to coordinate, the implementation would be more complex than in the US. The task force published a second report in October 2024 23 , reiterating its support for a move to T+1 in the EU, and recognising the potential benefits in terms of efficiency improvements and risk reduction. They considered that a move to T+1 would be a complex, multi-year undertaking, which requires the collaboration of all industry stakeholders to ensure that no new risks are introduced or the existing efficiency, liquidity and functioning of EU securities market are not damaged. In terms of scope, the task force supported aligning to the scope of the CSDR, albeit excluding securities financing transactions 24 . The task force’s members generally considered that, once a concrete transition date is communicated, a transition period of between 24 and 36 months would be required, reflecting the complexity of the market infrastructure landscape in the EU. A range of views were expressed as to whether the second half of 2027, the date identified for the UK transition, also could be a feasible implementation date for the EU. The task force remained highly supportive of a coordinated approach across the entire European region, including the EEA, the United Kingdom and Switzerland.  The above has been complemented by input, at times including confidential quantitative and qualitative information, provided by financial markets participants during bilateral meetings.  • Impact assessment  Due to the urgency to act given international developments, Commission services opted to prepare a Staff Working Document analysing the impacts of an EU move to a shorter settlement cycle. A derogation from the requirement to produce a fully-fledged impact assessment has been granted. The Staff Working Document took into account the ESMA Report assessing the costs and benefits of a shorter settlement cycle in the EU. The Staff Working Document pointed out that greater automation and standardisation of core back-office and post-trade processes, including a substantial increase in the use of straight-through processing, will be needed to enable the move to T+1. It indicated that the magnitude of the investment needs will vary from one market participant to another depending on their business model, the number of CSDs and CCPs they are connected to and whether previous investments have been made to comply with T+1 in other jurisdictions. It also highlighted that these mostly one-off costs should, over time, be outweighed by the long-term benefits of lower counterparty and market risks, more efficient and timely settlement and increased attractiveness of EU capital markets for investors. It concluded that given the fragmented nature of EU capital markets, coordination and cooperation of market participants is not only useful but essential to ensure a smooth move to T+1.  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  The initiative aims to enhance the competitiveness and attractiveness of the EU post-trade landscape by introducing a shorter settlement cycle in the EU. As such, it does not aim at reducing regulatory burdens and costs per se. C osts associated with a move to T+1 would manifest in the short term, related to the investments needed to modernise, standardise and digitalise various steps in the settlement process. These costs would be borne by financial entities . However, the expected benefits, such as increased automation and efficiency, risk reduction, lower margin requirement and elimination of misalignment-related costs and frictions, should, over time, largely outweigh the mostly one-off costs stemming from necessary investments that a move to T+1 would entail.  • Fundamental rights  The EU is committed to high standards of protection of fundamental rights and is signatory to a broad set of conventions on human rights. In this context, the proposal is not likely to have a direct impact on these rights, as listed in the main United Nations conventions on human rights, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union which is an integral part of the EU Treaties, and the European Convention on Human Rights.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  The proposal will have no implications for the budget of the Union.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  This proposal does not require an implementation plan or monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements.  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  Article 1 introduces a targeted amendment to Article 5(2) of the CSDR, requiring that for transactions in scope of Article 5(2) 25 , the intended settlement date shall be no later than on the first business day after the trading takes place. This proposal does not amend the scope of application of Article 5(2).  2025/0022 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 as regards a shorter settlement cycle in the Union  (Text with EEA relevance)  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank 26 ,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 27 ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 28 regulates the settlement period for most transactions in transferable securities executed on trading venues . W ith certain exceptions, the intended settlement date for such transactions is to be no later than on the second business day after the trading takes place. Such period is referred to as the ‘ settlement cycle ’ . T he requirement for the settlement to take place at the latest on the second business day after the trading takes place is referred to as ‘settlement cycle in T+2’, or, simply, ‘T+2’.  (2) Longer settlement periods for transactions in transferable securities increase risk s for transaction parties and reduce opportunities for buyers and sellers to enter into other transactions. For th ose reason s , many third-country jurisdictions have moved, are in the process of moving, or plan to move, to a settlement period of one business day after the trade (‘T+1’). T he global shift to shorter settlement period s is , however, creating misalignments between U nion and global financial markets. Those misalignments will only further increase when more countries move to T+1 settlement and increas e the cost caused by such misalignments for U nion market participants.  (3) In its r eport on the appropriateness of shortening the settlement cycle in the E uropean U nion , published on 18 November 2024, the European Securities and Markets Authority concluded that shortening the settlement cycle in the Union to T+1 would significantly reduce risks in the market, in particular with respect to counterparty and volatility risks, and free up capital no longer required to cover margin calls. T+1 would also enable U nion capital markets to keep up with the evolution of other global markets, eliminating the costs associated with the current misalignment of settlement periods. It would also contribute to further harmonisation of corporate event standards and market practices in the U nion and more generally to the competitiveness of U nion capital markets. The Commission shares those conclusions.  (4) It is therefore appropriate to introduce a targeted amendment to Regulation (EU) 909/2014 in order to shorten the current mandatory settlement cycle to one day after the trading takes place. Such shortening of the settlement cycle would not prevent central securities depositories from voluntarily settl ing transactions on the same date as the trade date , where technologically capable .  (5) Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 should therefore be amended accordingly.  (6) Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely to introduce a shorter settlement cycle in the Union, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of their scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.  (7) To ensure that all relevant stakeholders involved are sufficiently prepared and able to move to T+1 settlement in a coordinated and timely manner, t he date of application of this Regulation should be deferred .  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Article 1  Amendment to Regulation (EU) No 909/2014  In Article 5 of Regulation (EU) No 909/2014, paragraph 2 is replaced by the following:  ‘2. As regards transactions in transferable securities referred to in paragraph 1 which are executed on trading venues, the intended settlement date shall be no later than on the first business day after the trading takes place. That requirement shall not apply to transactions which are negotiated privately but executed on a trading venue, to transactions which are executed bilaterally but reported to a trading venue or to the first transaction where the transferable securities concerned are subject to initial recording in book-entry form pursuant to Article 3(2).’ .  Article 2  Entry into force and application  This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union .  It shall apply from 11 October 2027.  This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee(2),
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure(3),
Whereas:
(1) Article 5(2) of Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council(4)regulates the settlement period for most transactions in transferable securities executed on trading venues. With certain exceptions, the intended settlement date for such transactions is to be no later than on the second business day after the trading takes place. Such a period is referred to as the ‘settlement cycle’. The requirement for settlement to take place at the latest on the second business day after the trading takes place is referred to as the ‘T+2 settlement cycle’, or, simply, as ‘T+2’.
(2) Longer settlement periods for transactions in transferable securities increase the risks to the transaction parties and reduce the opportunities for buyers and sellers to enter into other transactions. For those reasons, many third-country jurisdictions have moved, are in the process of moving, or plan to move to a settlement period of one business day after the trading takes place (‘T+1’). The global shift to shorter settlement periods is, however, creating misalignments between Union and global financial markets. Those misalignments will further increase when more countries move to T+1 settlement, thereby increasing the costs to Union market participants caused by such misalignments. Furthermore, some capital markets have already shortened the settlement cycle for certain types of transactions to T+0. In the Union, central securities depositories already settle a non-negligible number of transactions on a T+0 basis.
(3) In its report of 18 November 2024 on the assessment of the appropriateness of shortening the settlement cycle in the European Union, the European Supervisory Authority (European Securities and Markets Authority) (ESMA), established by Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council(5), concluded that shortening the settlement cycle in the Union to T+1 would significantly reduce risks in the market, in particular with respect to counterparty and volatility risks, and free up capital no longer required to cover margin calls. The T+1 settlement cycle would also enable Union capital markets to keep up with the evolution of other global markets, eliminating the costs associated with the current misalignment of settlement periods. It would also contribute to the further harmonisation of corporate event standards and market practices in the Union, and more generally to the competitiveness of Union capital markets. The Commission shares those conclusions.
(4) It is therefore appropriate to introduce a targeted amendment to Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 in order to shorten the current mandatory settlement cycle to no later than one business day after the trading takes place. That shortening of the settlement cycle would not prevent central securities depositories from voluntarily settling transactions on the same date as the trade date, where technologically feasible.
(5) Securities financing transactions allow market participants to manage their liquidity and funding needs in a flexible manner. Market trends indicate a growing use of such transactions on trading venues. Certain securities financing transactions that are executed on trading venues would fall within the scope of the T+1 settlement cycle requirement. However, given the non-standardised nature of such transactions and, in particular, the non-standardised settlement periods that might need to be agreed to by the parties to such transactions to achieve their objectives, and to avoid discouraging their execution on trading venues, those transactions should be exempt from the T+1 settlement cycle requirement. At the same time, to avoid any risk of circumvention of the T+1 settlement cycle requirement, the exemption should apply only if the securities financing transactions in question are documented as single transactions composed of two linked operations. As a consequence, and for the purposes of the T+1 settlement cycle requirement, undocumented securities financing transactions should be subject to that requirement. An explicit exemption is not needed for margin lending transactions as they are not transactions in transferable securities and therefore fall outside the scope of the T+1 settlement cycle requirement.
(6) Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 provides for various measures to address settlement fails, including cash penalties imposed on failing participants. The calculation of those cash penalties is determined by parameters specified in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/389(6). The Commission is expected to keep track of market developments, the volume of settlement fails and the readiness of the industry to comply with the T+1 settlement cycle requirement, and to consider, accordingly, whether there is a significant risk that the move from a T+2 to a T+1 settlement cycle requirement would lead to a material increase in settlement fails. Where such a risk is identified, the Commission is able, where necessary, to consider whether to adjust Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/389 accordingly, or to take any other appropriate measure within the scope of the empowerments laid down in Regulation (EU) No 909/2014, in order to mitigate both financial and non-financial adverse consequences. Any adjustments should be temporary, proportionate to the objective and designed to avoid imposing excessive costs on the industry.
(7) ESMA should monitor settlement efficiency during the move to a T+1 settlement cycle and should report thereon with increased frequency during the months immediately preceding and immediately following that move. In light of the exemption from the T+1 settlement cycle requirement for certain types of securities financing transactions pursuant to this Regulation, ESMA should pay particular attention to the settlement efficiency of securities financing transactions traded on or outside trading venues.
(8) Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(9) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely to introduce a shorter settlement cycle in the Union, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.
(10) To ensure that all relevant stakeholders involved are sufficiently prepared and able to move to the T+1 settlement cycle in a coordinated and timely manner, the date of application of this Regulation should be deferred,

Article 2

This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in theOfficial Journal of the European Union.
It shall apply from 11 October 2027.
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.
Done at Strasbourg, 8 October 2025.",https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202502075,"The European Commission has proposed a regulation aimed at shortening the securities settlement cycle in the EU from two business days (T+2) to one business day (T+1). This initiative seeks to enhance the efficiency and competitiveness of EU capital markets, which are vital for supporting the EU's digital, green, and social transitions. Despite efforts to integrate these markets, they remain fragmented, which hinders their development. Reports from 2024 highlight the need for innovation in post-trade services, which are crucial for the issuance, settlement, and risk management of securities.

Currently, over EUR 4 trillion in securities are settled daily in EU central securities depositories (CSDs). Longer settlement periods increase risks for buyers and sellers, delay investors' access to funds or securities, and limit opportunities for further transactions. The proposal aligns with a global trend towards shorter settlement cycles, with countries like the US, China, India, and Canada already adopting T+1. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) recommends moving to T+1 by October 2027, citing benefits such as risk reduction, margin savings, and alignment with global markets.

Shortening the settlement cycle would require significant changes in market operations, impacting various stakeholders differently. While the transition may incur short-term costs related to modernizing and digitalizing settlement processes, the long-term benefits include improved market integration and avoiding competitive disadvantages for EU markets. Maintaining the current T+2 cycle could further fragment the market.

For transactions in","The European Parliament and the Council have adopted a regulation to shorten the settlement cycle for securities transactions in the EU from T+2 to T+1, meaning transactions must be settled by the next business day. This move aims to reduce risks and align with global market trends, enhancing the competitiveness of EU capital markets. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) supports this change, though certain securities financing transactions, like securities lending and repurchase transactions, are exempt to prevent discouraging their execution on trading venues. The regulation includes measures to address settlement fails and allows the European Commission to adjust regulations if necessary to mitigate adverse impacts, ensuring any changes are temporary and proportionate. ESMA is tasked with monitoring settlement efficiency, particularly for exempted transactions, and will report frequently during the transition period. The regulation emphasizes coordination and preparation among stakeholders, deferring its application date to ensure a smooth transition. Additionally, the regulation requires detailed reporting on the categories of transactions, their intended settlement dates, and whether they are executed on trading venues. It also mandates an assessment of the market impact and justification for exemptions from the T+1 settlement requirement for certain securities financing transactions. The regulation will enter into force on the twentieth day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union and will apply from 11 October 2027."

2.4.2025  COM(2025) 143 final  2025/0074(COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulation (EU) 2018/1727 as regards the extension of the timeframe for the establishment of the Eurojust case management system  EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM  1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  Eurojust, the European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation, supports the cooperation and coordination between national competent authorities in the investigation and prosecution of serious cross-border crime cases.  The National Member of the Member State requesting Eurojust’s support opens a case in the Eurojust Case Management System (CMS) and uses this IT-system to exchange case related information with the National Members of the other Member States (or liaison prosecutors in case of third countries) involved in the specific case. The purpose of the CMS is to facilitate the storage and exchange of sensitive personal operational data in a secure manner, in full compliance with data protection safeguards, and respecting strict retention periods. The CMS is thereby the beating heart of Eurojust’s support to national authorities.  The current CMS is technically outdated, which was one of the reasons for the Commission to propose an amendment to the Eurojust Regulation in 2021, which was adopted as Regulation (EU) 2023/2131 as regards digital information exchange in terrorism cases. The latter Regulation includes provisions on the CMS enabling a new, more flexible technical design, and providing for a transitional period, which allows the continued use of the ‘old’ CMS until 1 December 2025. The Commission’s proposal was accompanied by a legislative financial statement to ensure that Eurojust would receive the necessary financial and human resources to set-up the new CMS with all necessary functionalities until this deadline.  In a letter to the Commission sent in December 2024, Eurojust raised its concern about its ability to comply with the statutory deadline for the set-up of the new CMS. This has been confirmed in later discussions. The main reasons for the delay are difficulties with the external contractor supporting the development of the ‘new’ CMS. Additionally, the migration of data from the ‘old’ to the ‘new’ CMS and the verification of data is taking much more time than anticipated, in particular as it requires manual interventions due to the complicated structure of the ‘old’ CMS and the involvement of the national desks.  The Eurojust Regulation obliges Eurojust to store all operational personal data in the CMS and sets out a prohibition to store operational personal data elsewhere. The relevant transitional provision in the Eurojust Regulation was proposed with the explicit purpose to allow Eurojust to continue to use the old CMS until the statutory deadline of 1 December 2025, but at the same time to set a final time limit to such use.  Using the ‘old’ CMS beyond the transitional period provided for in the Eurojust Regulation would expose Eurojust to liability for the unlawful processing of operational personal data. Such unlawful processing of data could be challenged in national judicial procedures and ultimately be brought before the European Court of Justice. National courts might consequently consider information and evidence exchanged with the support of Eurojust inadmissible, which could have a negative impact on the prosecution of the crime at hand, and which could have a significant negative impact on the combat against serious cross-border crime and the security in the Union.  As the transitional rules for Eurojust’s “Core International Crimes Evidence Database”, in which evidence relating to international crimes including the crime of aggression against Ukraine is stored, and which was established based on Regulation (EU) 2022/838, are also linked to the statutory deadline of 1 December 2025, such concerns apply equally to evidence stored in that database. The failure to integrate that database into the ‘new’ CMS and the continued processing of data outside of the ‘new’ CMS after 1 December 2025 could negatively impact the admissibility of the evidence collected in the framework of the International Centre for the Prosecution of the Crime of Aggression against Ukraine, embedded in Eurojust, which could even have adverse effects on prosecutions before a future Special Tribunal for the Crime of Aggression against Ukraine.  Therefore, the Commission is proposing a technical amendment to the relevant provision of the Eurojust Regulation to ensure that the use of the ‘old’ CMS remains lawful until the ""new"" CMS is fully operational, and the relevant data has been transferred to the ‘new’ CMS.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  The set-up of a new, state-of-the-art CMS for Eurojust, including a better integrated, updated European Judicial Counter-Terrorism Register, is in line with the Digitalisation of Justice Strategy 1 , the EU Security Union Strategy 2 and the Counter-Terrorism Agenda for the European Union 3 .  • Consistency with other Union policies  The proposal is in line with the European data protection acquis. It sets out clear transitional rules applicable to the continued use of the ‘old’ CMS and the starting of the ‘new’ CMS and sets clear safeguards for the transitional period.  The proposal is also in line with the overall digitalisation of the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice, in particular the interoperability framework 4 . The ‘ new ’ CMS will enhance interoperability with other IT-systems established in the Area of Freedom Security and Justice and will facilitate exchanges and searches in the European Search Portal.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  The legal basis of the amendment of Eurojust’s legal basis is Article 85 Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Under Art. 85 TFEU, Eurojust’s structure, operation, field of action and tasks are to be determined by a regulation. This also includes the establishment and functioning of the Agency’s CMS.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  According to the principle of subsidiarity laid down in Article 5(3) of the Treaty on European Union (TEU), action at EU level should only be taken when the aims cannot be sufficiently achieved by Member States alone and can therefore, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved at EU level. There is also a need to match the nature and intensity of a given measure to the identified problem.  There is a specific need for EU action because the measures envisaged have an intrinsic EU dimension. They aim at improving the ability of Eurojust to act, through the exchange of operational personal data in the CMS in a secure manner. It is Eurojust’s mission to support and strengthen coordination and cooperation between national judicial authorities in relation to serious crime, including terrorism, affecting two or more Member States or requiring a prosecution on common bases. This objective can only be achieved at the EU level, in line with the subsidiarity principle. Member States cannot create a more appropriate legal framework for dealing with possible delays in the set-up of the ‘new’ CMS. It is therefore up to the EU to establish the legally binding instruments to achieve these results in line with the powers conferred upon it by the EU treaties.  • Proportionality  According to the principle of proportionality laid down in Article 5(4) TEU, there is a need to match the nature and intensity of a given measure to the identified problem. All problems addressed in this proposal call for EU-level support for Member States to tackle these problems effectively.  This proposal aims at mitigating the delay in the set-up of the 'new' CMS and its significant consequences, by proposing a technical amendment of the relevant provision of the Eurojust Regulation to ensure that the use of the ‘old’ CMS remains lawful until the ‘new’ CMS is fully operational. Without this amendment, Eurojust is unable to continue storing operational personal data in the ‘old’ CMS after the expiry of the current statutory deadline, while it cannot store these data elsewhere. Consequently, it will not be able to fulfil its crucial role in supporting and strengthening cooperation between Member States’ national authorities in the investigation and prosecution of serious forms of crime, including terrorism. To enable Eurojust to fully perform its crucial task, it is necessary to ensure a transitional period that allows the migration from the ‘old’ to the ‘new’ CMS.  Therefore, in line with the principle of proportionality, the proposal does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve this objective.  • Choice of the instrument  Under Article 85(1) TFEU, Eurojust's legal framework shall be defined by a Regulation. Any amendment of this legal framework also requires a regulation.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  Not Applicable  • Stakeholder consultations  Not Applicable  • Collection and use of expertise  Not Applicable  • Impact assessment  Not Applicable  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  Not Applicable  • Fundamental rights  The Eurojust CMS has been established to ensure the secure handling of operational personal data and compliance with retention periods set out in the Eurojust Regulation. To avoid any circumvention of these rules, the Eurojust Regulation prohibits to store operational personal data anywhere outside the CMS.  To migrate data from the ‘old’ CMS to the ‘new’ CMS and to verify the correctness of the migrated data, the two systems will need to run in parallel for a certain period. That will lead to a duplication of data and impact the principle of data minimisation. However, the purpose of this temporary duplication is to enable the secure transition to the new technical infrastructure, which will consider the data protection by design principle and ensure at the same time highest ICT security standards and therefore provide better data protection safeguards by default. There is also no other, quicker means to migrate the data from the ’old’ to the ‘new’ CMS. Much of the data stored, for example attachments, have individualised access rights, which need to be maintained manually in the migration. In addition, each national desk stored data in a different manner, which is why this data needs to be migrated with support and involvement of the staff of each national desk. The migration is therefore also dependent on their workload and availability. The duplication is limited to the extent necessary. Eurojust may only use the ‘old’ CMS until the migration and verification of data is concluded, with a fixed maximum time limit of 1 December 2027. Therefore, this impact on data minimisation is justified.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  This proposal does not have any budgetary implication for the EU budget.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  Not Applicable  • Explanatory documents (for directives)  Not Applicable  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  The proposed amendment extends the statutory deadline set out in Article 80(9) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1727 for maintaining the ‘old’ CMS and the establishment of the ‘new’ CMS from 1 December 2025 to 1 December 2027. This change will give Eurojust two additional years to ensure a successful transition to the ‘new’ case management system.  In addition, following the last half-sentence of Article 80(9) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1727, which provides that the ‘old’ CMS would need to stop operations, when the ‘new’ CMS has taken up operations, an additional half-sentence is added to ensure that Eurojust can migrate the data from the ‘old’ CMS to the ‘new’ CMS. The migration from the ‘old’ to the ‘new’ CMS requires significant manual intervention as every national desk of Eurojust stores information and attachments in a different way, a process which will require several months. After the data has been migrated, its accuracy will need to be verified before the ‘old’ CMS can stop operations. However, this transitional phase must be limited in time. The ‘old’ CMS may only be used until the ‘new’ CMS is in place and the migration and verification of the accuracy of the data have been completed, or until the final statutory deadline of 1 December 2027, beyond which the ‘old’ CMS may not be used anymore. This extended statutory deadline gives Eurojust enough time to establish the ‘new’ CMS, while setting a maximum time limit in the legal basis itself.  2025/0074 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulation (EU) 2018/1727 as regards the extension of the timeframe for the establishment of the Eurojust case management system  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 85 thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) Regulation (EU) 2018/1727 of the European Parliament and of the Council 5 establishe s the European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation ( Eurojust ) and sets out its tasks, competence and functions.  (2) To store all operational personal data securely, Eurojust established a c ase m anagement s ystem composed of temporary work files and an index . Through the c ase m anagement s ystem, n ational m ember s of Eurojust exchange all case related information securely and in full compliance with the data protection rules . Eurojust may not establish any other automated data file to process operational personal data.  (3) Regulation (EU) 2023/2131 of the European Parliament and the Council 6 amended Regulation (EU) 2018/1727 to provide the legal framework for a modernised case management system. Th at new case management system is to integrate and enable the functionalities of the European Judicial Counter-Terrorism Register and improve Eurojust’s ability to identify links between cross-border judicial proceedings against suspects of terrorist offences and information processed at Eurojust relating to other cases of serious crimes while taking, as a rule, full advantage of existing national and Union mechanisms for comparing biometric data.  (4) T he deadline for setting up the new case management system is 1 December 2025 . However, due to external factors and the complexity of the migration , Eurojust will not be able to set up the new case management system within th at deadline. Therefore, until the new case management system is set up, it is necessary to provide that Eurojust may continue to use the case management system composed of temporary work files and an index .  (5) To allow Eurojust to test and ensure the operationality and interoperability of the new case management system in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2024/903 of the European Parliament and of the Council 7 , and to migrate the data from the case management system composed of temporary work files and an index to the new case management system, it is necessary to extend the deadline.  (6) Eurojust should be able to maintain the case management system composed of temporary work files and an index after the new case management system has taken up operations to migrate the data from the case management system composed of temporary work files and an index to the new case management system and verify the correctness of the migrated data, but not beyond the 1 December 2027 . The extension of the current timeframe for the establishment of the new case management system by two years should give Eurojust sufficient time to fin a lise the set-up of the new case management system , while limiting the period within which the duplication of operational personal data is exceptionally permitted .

Title of the proposal/initiative  Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on the extension of the timeframe for the establishment of the Eurojust Case Management System and amending Regulation (EU) 2018/1727  1.2. Policy area(s) concerned  Policy area: Justice and fundamental rights  Activity: Investing in people, social cohesion and values  071007: European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation (Eurojust)  1.3. Objective(s)  1.3.1. General objective(s)  Based on amending Regulation 2023/2131, Eurojust is working on the set-up of a new case management system (CMS). Due to delays in the development by the external contractor and the long period the migration of data will require, Eurojust will not be able to set-up the “new” CMS and to migrate all operational data from the “old” to the “new” CMS within the legal deadline. The overall objective is to ensure the continued legality of data processing at Eurojust by extending the legal deadline for the set-up of the “new” CMS.  1.3.2. Specific objective(s)  The specific objective derives from the general objective as outlined above:  Specific objective 1:  To ensure that prosecution cases at national level supported by Eurojust cannot be challenged based on the claim that Eurojust held data in an unlawful manner.  Specific objective 2:  To ensure that Eurojust can test the new system and migrate the operational data from the old to the “new” CMS.  1.3.3. Expected result(s) and impact  Specify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.  Smoothen the transition from the “old” to the “new” CMS and ensure the legality of the data throughout the process.  1.3.4. Indicators of performance  Specify the indicators for monitoring progress and achievements.  - Setup of the new CMS and migration of data from the “old” to the “new” CMS by the 1 December 2027.  1.4. The proposal/initiative relates to:   a new action   a new action following a pilot project / preparatory action 8   the extension of an existing action   a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action  1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative  1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative  Eurojust will have to finalise the development, consult the European Data Protection Supervisor, set-up and test the “new” CMS and migrate the operational data from the “old” to the “new” CMS and verify the correctness of the data until 1 December 2027.  1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, great er effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this section 'added value of EU involvement' is the value resulting from EU action, that is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.  The “new” CMS will render Eurojust’s support to national competent authorities more efficient and facilitate the work of the Eurojust national desks significantly by digitalising processes. It will enable better identification of cross-border links between cases opened in different Member States and therefore enhance the fight against serious cross-border crime.  1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past  The development of large IT projects often entails significant delays as the development is difficult to predict. Also here, the development was delayed by difficulties with the external contractor and unexpectedly and unpredictably long period, which the migration of operational data from the “old” to the “new” CMS will require. Hence, the deadline is extended for another two years.  1.5.4. Compatibility with the multiannual financial framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments  This proposal does not have any budgetary implication for the EU budget. The budgetary impact for the set-up of the “new” CMS is already covered by the legislative financial statement accompagnying Regulation (EU) 2023/2131.  1.5.5. Assessment of the different available financing options, including scope for redeployment  This initiative is already covered by the legislative financial statement accompanying Regulation (EU) 2023/2131.  1.6.

amending Regulation (EU) 2018/1727 as regards the extension of the timeframe for the establishment of the Eurojust case management system
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 85 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure(1),
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EU) 2018/1727 of the European Parliament and of the Council(2)establishes the European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation (Eurojust) and sets out its tasks, competence and functions.
(2) To store all operational personal data securely, Eurojust established a case management system composed of temporary work files and an index. Through the case management system, national members of Eurojust exchange all case-related information securely and in compliance with the applicable data protection rules. Pursuant to Article 23(6) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1727, Eurojust is not permitted to establish any other automated data file to process operational personal data.
(3) Regulation (EU) 2023/2131 of the European Parliament and of the Council(3)amended Regulation (EU) 2018/1727 to provide the legal framework for a modernised case management system (the ‘new case management system’). The new case management system is to integrate and enable the functionalities of the European Judicial Counter-Terrorism Register and improve Eurojust’s ability to identify links between cross-border judicial proceedings against suspects of terrorist offences and information processed at Eurojust relating to other cases of serious crimes while taking full advantage of existing national and Union mechanisms for comparing biometric data.
(4) The deadline for setting up the new case management system is 1 December 2025 (the ‘deadline’). However, due to external factors and the complexity of the migration, Eurojust will not be able to set up the new case management system by the deadline. It is therefore necessary to allow Eurojust to continue to use the case management system composed of temporary work files and an index until the new case management system is set up.
(5) To allow Eurojust to test and ensure the operationality and interoperability of the new case management system in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2024/903 of the European Parliament and of the Council(4), and to migrate the data from the case management system composed of temporary work files and an index to the new case management system, it is necessary to extend the deadline.
(6) In order to migrate the data from the case management system composed of temporary work files and an index to the new case management system and to verify the accuracy of the migrated data, Eurojust should be able to maintain the case management system composed of temporary work files and an index after the new case management system has become operational, but not beyond 1 December 2027. The extension of the deadline by two years should provide Eurojust with sufficient time to finalise the setting up of the new case management system, while limiting the period within which the duplication of operational personal data is, exceptionally, permitted.
(7) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 and Article 4a(1) of Protocol No 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and without prejudice to Article 4 of that Protocol, Ireland is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application.
(8) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No 22 on the position of Denmark, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application.
(9) The European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with Article 42(1) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council(5)and delivered an opinion on 22 April 2025,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

Article 1

In Article 80 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1727, paragraph 9 is replaced by the following:
‘9.   Eurojust may continue to use the case management system composed of temporary work files and an index until 1 December 2027, unless the new case management system is already in place, and the migration of the data from the case management system composed of temporary work files and an index, and the verification of the accuracy of those data, have been completed before that date.’.

Article 2

This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in theOfficial Journal of the European Union.
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in the Member States in accordance with the Treaties.
Done at Strasbourg, 8 October 2025.",https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202502082,"The European Commission has proposed an extension for Eurojust, the EU agency tasked with coordinating cross-border criminal investigations, to transition to a new case management system (CMS). This system is crucial for securely exchanging data among national authorities, but the current CMS is outdated and requires an upgrade to improve functionality and security. Originally, the transition was scheduled for completion by December 2025, but significant delays have occurred due to challenges with the external contractor and the complex data migration process.

To address these issues, the proposal seeks to legally extend the use of the old CMS beyond the initial deadline, ensuring Eurojust can continue its operations without legal repercussions for data handling. This extension is vital to prevent potential legal challenges that could affect the admissibility of evidence in court cases. The proposal aligns with broader EU strategies for digitalization and data protection, aiming to enhance the interoperability of justice systems across the EU. By allowing more time for the transition, the proposal aims to ensure a smooth and secure upgrade to the CMS, supporting Eurojust's mission to combat serious cross-border crime effectively.

The proposed amendment extends the deadline for maintaining the old CMS and establishing the new CMS from December 1, 2025, to December 1, 2027. This change provides Eurojust with two additional years to ensure a successful transition. The migration from the old to the new CMS requires significant manual intervention, as each national desk of Eurojust stores information differently, necessitating several months for data migration.

Performance indicators have","The European Parliament and the Council have adopted a regulation to extend the deadline for establishing Eurojust's new case management system, which is designed to securely store and exchange operational personal data related to criminal justice cooperation across the EU. Originally set for December 1, 2025, the deadline has been extended to December 1, 2027, due to the complexity of the system's migration and external factors. This extension allows Eurojust to continue using its existing system of temporary work files and an index until the new system is fully operational and data migration is complete. The new system aims to enhance Eurojust's capabilities in managing cross-border judicial proceedings, particularly in terrorism cases, by integrating functionalities from the European Judicial Counter-Terrorism Register and improving data interoperability. The regulation ensures that Eurojust can maintain data accuracy and operationality during this transition period. Notably, Ireland and Denmark are not participating in or bound by this regulation due to their specific positions within the EU's legal framework."

CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified full-scale invasion of Ukraine since 24 February 2022 has had a profound negative impact on Ukraine’s ability to trade with the rest of the world. In this difficult context, the European Council underlined in its conclusions of 27 October 2023 and 15 December 2023 (as reconfirmed on 19 December 2024) that it will continue to provide strong political and economic support to Ukraine for as long as it takes.  Ukraine has requested the Union to make it as easy as possible for it to maintain its trade position with the rest of the world and to further deepen its trade relations with the Union. Measures to this end have included market access liberalisation for Ukrainian exports through Regulation (EU) 2022/870 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2022 1 and Regulation (EU) 2023/1077 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 May 2023 2 on temporary trade-liberalisation measures supplementing trade concessions applicable to Ukrainian products under the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement. Regulation (EU) 2024/1392 entered into force on 6 June 2024 and will remain in force until 5 June 2025 3 . These measures have increased flexibility and certainty for Ukrainian producers.  Ukraine is still a major exporter of iron and steel, despite the fact that the war has caused the destruction or occupation of many production facilities . It therefore remains necessary to maintain the suspension of Regulation (EU) 2015/478 on common rules for imports 4 . This suspension is and would remain the legal basis for the suspension of the Union’s current safeguard measure on steel products ( vis-à-vis such imports from Ukraine ) as part of the Union ’s support.  For this purpose, it is necessary to suspend Articles 2, 4-7, 9-17 and 19-21 of Regulation (EU) 2015/478 on common rules, as far as imports from Ukraine are concerned.  In view of this need to continue to support Ukraine economically, the Commission is proposing a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council to suspend the application of Articles 2, 4-7, 9-17 and 19-21 of Regulation (EU) 2015/478 on common rules for imports with respect of imports originating in Ukraine.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  The suspension of Regulation (EU) 2015/478 on common rules for imports would be consistent with the EU’s strong support of Ukraine by means of international trade in the context of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine.  • Consistency with other Union policies  The Union has strongly condemned Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine and has taken unprecedented steps to support Ukraine in this exceptional context. These steps include financial assistance (including macro-financial assistance for emergency measures and reconstruction); the delivery of military equipment; the adoption of extensive sanctions against Russia and Belarus; and the intensification of cooperation under the Association Agreement. In addition, Ukraine was granted EU candidate status in June 2022 and Accession Negotiations were opened in December 2023.  The proposed regulation would therefore comply with and follow on from the Union’s obligation under Article 21(3) of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) to ensure consistency between the different areas of its external action. It would also comply with Article 207(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which requires the common commercial policy to be conducted in the context of the principles and objectives of the Union’s external actions.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  The legal basis for the proposal is Article 207(2) of the TFEU.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  The subsidiarity principle does not apply because, in accordance with Article 3(1)(e) of the TFEU, the common commercial policy is an exclusive Union competence.  • Proportionality  This proposal is necessary in order to achieve the objective of supporting Ukraine in its current difficulties economically, including in the area of trade with the Union.  • Choice of the instrument  This proposal is in accordance with Article 207(2) of the TFEU, which envisages common commercial policy measures.  3. RESULTS OF EX POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  Not applicable.  • Stakeholder consultations  Not applicable.  • Collection and use of expertise  Not applicable.  • Impact assessment  In order to ensure the continuation of the trade-liberalisation measures for Ukraine after the expiry of Regulation (EU) 2024/1392 on 5 June 2025, it is necessary for the proposed Regulation to enter into force on 6 June 2025. This urgent need means that there has not been sufficient time to carry out an impact assessment. However, the trade and trade-related provisions of the Association Agreement have been subject to a sustainability impact assessment that the Commission’s Directorate-General for Trade commissioned in 2007 and which fed into the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) negotiation process. That study confirmed that the implementation of trade and trade-related provisions would have a positive economic impact on the EU as well as on Ukraine.  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  The measure does not increase the regulatory burden on companies.  • Fundamental rights  These measures respect the same basic principles as those enshrined in the Association Agreement between the EU and Ukraine. In particular, Article 2 of the Association Agreement with Ukraine provides that that Agreement’s essential elements are (i) respect for democratic principles, human rights and fundamental freedoms; and (ii) respect for the principle of the rule of law.  The trade-liberalising measures would also be in accordance with the European Charter on Fundamental Rights for three reasons. Firstly, their direct effect is that imports from Ukraine can be subjected to fewer restrictions than would be the case if surveillance and safeguards applied to imports from Ukraine. Secondly, the Union could not thereby fail in its duty to protect fundamental rights under the Charter because the protection of any fundamental rights in question (where necessary) remains possible by other means. Thirdly, as regards the unequal treatment of importers or users of products originating in Ukraine (compared with that of importers or users of products originating in other third countries that are not exempted from surveillance and safeguards), such an unequal treatment is applied in other cases where the Union’s bilateral trade agreements exempt imports from safeguard measures and is a legitimate exercise (including the use of a proper legal basis) of the Union’s common commercial policy for the purpose of closer economic integration.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  Not applicable.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  Not applicable.  • Explanatory documents (for directives)  Not applicable.  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  Given the economic situation in Ukraine, this proposed Regulation is intended to protect the market access conditions for imports from Ukraine by suspending certain provisions on the surveillance and safeguards in Regulation (EU) 2015/478 on common rules for imports.  2025/0056 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  suspending certain parts of Regulation (EU) 2015/478 as regards imports of Ukrainian products into the European Union  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 207(2) thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure 5 ,  Whereas:  (1) The Association Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community and their Member States, of the one part, and Ukraine, of the other part (the Association Agreement) 6 constitutes the basis of the relationship between the Union and Ukraine. In accordance with Council Decision 2014/668/EU 7 , Title IV of the Association Agreement, which relates to trade and trade-related matters, entered into provisional application on 1 January 2016 and entered into force on 1 September 2017, following ratification by all Member States.  (2) The Association Agreement strengthen s and widen s the Parties relations in an ambitious and innovative way , with a view to facilitat ing and achieve ing gradual economic integration ; and to do so in accordance with the rights and obligations arising out of the Parties’ membership of the World Trade Organization .  (3) Regulation (EU) 2015/478 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 2015 8 lays down common rules for imports originating in most third countries, including Ukraine .

(4) Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified full-scale invasion of Ukraine has , since 24 February 2022 , had a profoundly negative impact on Ukraine’s ability to trade with the rest of the world . This has been the case for iron and steel , for example , because of the occupation or destruction of iron and steel production facilities . It has also been the case for other parts of the Ukrainian economy .  (5) In these circumstances and in order to mitigate the negative economic impact of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, it is appropriate, for Ukraine’s benefit, to exempt Union imports originating in Ukraine from Union surveillance and safeguard measures. For this purpose, it is necessary to suspend various provisions of Regulation (EU) 2015/478 on common rules for imports from Uk r aine.  (6) T he Commission should be able to temporarily suspend the application of this Regulation in resp e ct of a specific product by means of a n implementing act . Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council 9 . The duration of such suspension should be long enough to allow the Commision to make a proposal ; and for the Parliament and Council to adopt a R egulation suspending, amending or terminating this Regulation.  (7) This Regulation should apply for three years and its application should be tacitly renewed for further three year periods u nless and until either the European Parliament or the Council would oppose such an extension three months before the expiry date.  (8) In light of the forthcoming expiry on 5 June 2025 of Regulation (EU) 2024/1392 of the European Parliament and of the Council 10 , which provides , among other things , for effects equivalent to the effects of this Regulation , this Regulation should enter into force on 6 June 2025 ,  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Article 1 Trade-liberalisation measures  The application of Article 2, Articles 4 to 7, Articles 9 to 17 and Articles 19 to 21 of Regulation (EU) 2015/478 on common rules for imports shall be suspended with regard to imports into the Union originating in Ukraine.  Article 2 Temporary suspension  The Commission shall be empowered to adopt an implementing act to suspend the application of this Regulation in respect of a specific product for a period that in principle shall not exceed twelve months, if imports of this product that originate in Ukraine increase to a level that contributes significantly to the serious injury or threat of serious injury to a Union industry that produces the like or directly competitive product. That implementing act shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 3(2).  Article 3  Committee procedure  1. The Commission shall be assisted by the Committee on Safeguards with regard to Article 4 of this Regulation. That Committee shall be a committee within the meaning of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011.  2. Where reference is made to this paragraph, Article 5 of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 shall apply.  Article 4  Entry into force and application  This Regulation shall enter into force on 6 June 2025.  It shall apply for an initial period of three years.  Its application shall be tacitly extended for successive periods of three years unless the European Parliament or the Council opposes such an extension no later than three months before the end of each period.

(As an agreement was reached between Parliament and Council, Parliament's position corresponds to the final legislative act, Regulation (EU) 2025/1153.)",,,,,,,,,,"The European Commission has proposed a regulation to temporarily suspend certain parts of an existing EU regulation governing the import of Ukrainian products, particularly steel, to support Ukraine amid economic challenges caused by Russia's invasion. This proposal is part of the EU's broader strategy to assist Ukraine through financial aid, military support, and sanctions against Russia, aligning with the EU's commitment to its foundational principles. By reducing restrictions on imports from Ukraine, the regulation aims to provide economic relief and enhance Ukraine's market access within the EU, benefiting both parties without increasing the regulatory burden on companies. The suspension is designed to respect fundamental rights and principles, consistent with the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement, which emphasizes democratic values, human rights, and the rule of law.

The regulation is set to enter into force on June 6, 2025, coinciding with the expiry of a related regulation, and will initially apply for three years, with the possibility of renewal unless opposed by the European Parliament or the Council three months before its expiry. The Commission will have the authority to suspend the regulation for specific products if their import levels significantly harm EU industries producing similar products. This decision will follow a committee procedure involving the Committee on Safeguards. Additionally, the proposal includes anti-fraud measures, requiring Ukraine to comply with conditions under the Association Agreement, including rules of origin and administrative cooperation. The proposal is expected to have no financial implications on the EU budget.",
