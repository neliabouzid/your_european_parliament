EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 as regards obligations of economic operators concerning battery due diligence policies  (Text with EEA relevance)  EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM  1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 ( 1 ) aims to contribute to the efficient functioning of the internal market, while preventing and reducing the adverse impacts of batteries on the environment . It also aims to protect the environment and human health by preventing and reducing the adverse impacts of the generation and management of waste batteries. It imposes a mong other thing s battery due diligence obligations on economic operators placing batteries on the market or putting them into service. These obligations are to be applied from 18 August 2025.  Battery raw material supply chains are affected by a shifting geopolitical landscape. This leaves the battery industry with many challenges in particular related to sourcing raw materials. It takes time to analyse and adjust supply chains.  Furthermore, one of the battery due diligence obligations is that economic operators’ battery due diligence policies are verified by a notified body (‘third-party verification’). Only about half of the Member States have appointed their notifying authority in charge of the assessment, notification and monitoring of conformity assessment bodies. In many cases such applications would be based on accreditation, but the European co-operation for Accreditation association has not been able to determine a standard for the accreditation of notified bodies for battery due diligence. It instead indicated that this should rely on schemes approved by the European Commission.  Due diligence schemes being developed by industry associations and groupings of interested organisations are expected to play an important role in the implementation of the battery due diligence obligations. The provisions on such schemes in Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 mirror those of Regulation (EU) 2017/821, for which several schemes are being assessed for recognition, but no scheme has been recognised to date. Schemes that address battery raw materials still need to be further developed and implemented and then go through the recognition process for schemes under Regulation (EU) 2023/1542.  In addition , Article 94(4) of Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 requires the Commission to assess , one year after the Directive (EU) 2024/1760 on corporate sustainability due diligence ( 2 ) was adopted , whether amendments to the battery due diligence obligations are necessary in light of the adoption of that Directive . While it is too early for such an assessment, especially because the Commission proposed amendments to Directive (EU) 2024/1760 on 26 February 2025 , consistency in implementation could be improved by developing the guidelines for both pieces of legislation hand in hand , if the application date s allow to do so .  For these reasons, the Commission considers that the date of application of the battery due diligence obligations specified in Article 48(1) of Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 should be postponed by two years to allow economic operators placing batteries on the EU market to be better prepared, with the help of guidelines, and to allow time to resolve difficulties with the availability of notified bodies.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  The adoption of Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 was an integral part of the European Green Deal and is coherent with its overall objectives and all the initiatives developed under it. This proposal does not amend any substantive rules of Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 but merely aims to accord additional time for economic operators placing batteries on the EU market to be better prepared and to resolve difficulties with the availability of notified bodies.  • Consistency with other Union policies  Directive (EU) 2024/1760 on corporate sustainability due diligence lays down rules and obligations to ensure that companies identify and address potential and actual adverse human rights and environmental impacts in the company’s own operations, their subsidiaries and, when related to their chains of activities, those of their business partners.  Directive (EU) 2024/1760 was adopted after the adoption of Regulation (EU) 2023/1542. It specifies that the Directive is ‘without prejudice to obligations in the areas of human, employment and social rights, and of protection of the environment and climate change under other Union legislative acts’, and that ‘if a provision of this Directive conflicts with a provision of another Union legislative act pursuing the same objectives and providing for more extensive or more specific obligations, the provision of that other Union legislative act shall prevail to the extent of the conflict and shall apply as regards those specific obligations.’ This is the case for the more specific requirements of the battery due diligence policy in Regulation (EU) 2023/1542. Operators in the battery supply chain must therefore apply the battery due diligence policy of Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 insofar as they are more extensive or more specific, instead of the equivalent provisions in Directive (EU) 2024/1760 for the supply chain stages and the minerals specified. For other operations, operators in scope of both legislative acts must follow the rules of Directive (EU) 2024/1760.  There are some elements where the due diligence obligations of Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 are not harmonious with the provisions of Directive (EU) 2024/1760. This is because Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 is product-specific and Directive (EU) 2024/1760 is cross-sectorial.  This proposal addresses consistency to the extent possible by harmonising the publication dates for guidelines under both pieces of legislation so they can be developed hand in hand.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  Due diligence obligations on economic operators placing batteries on the market or putting them into service should prevent and reduce adverse impacts of batteries on the environment and ensure a sustainable battery value chain. Such measures will help to ensure the transition to a circular economy and the long-term competitiveness of the EU. They should also contribute to the efficient functioning of the internal market, while taking into account a high level of protection of the environment. To prevent divergences hampering the free circulation of batteries Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be used as a legal basis of the proposal.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  This initiative is consistent with the principle of subsidiarity. Given the need to modify Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 by postponing the application of its due diligence obligations, the objectives of this initiative cannot be achieved by the Member States themselves.  • Proportionality  The proposal is consistent with the principle of proportionality, i.e. it does not go beyond what is necessary to meet the objectives of the Treaties and in particular the smooth functioning of the internal market. As with the subsidiarity test, it is not possible for Member States to address the issues without a proposal to amend the date of application of the due diligence obligations of Regulation (EU) 2023/1542.  • Choice of the instrument  The proposal amends Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 concerning batteries and waste batteries only as regards the postponement of the date of application. It should therefore follow the same type of act, i.e. a regulation.  3. RESULTS OF EX POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  Not applicable.  • Stakeholder consultations  Not applicable.  • Collection and use of expertise  Not applicable.  • Impact assessment  Not applicable.  An impact assessment was carried out for the proposal, which led to the adoption of Regulation (EU) 2023/1542. The current proposal only amends the date of application of the due diligence obligations of Regulation (EU) 2023/1542.  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  The main goal of this proposal is to postpone the date of application of the due diligence obligations of Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 by two years to allow economic operators placing batteries on the EU market to be better prepared, with the help of guidelines, and resolve difficulties with third-party verification.  The proposal does not change the substance of the rules, it only postpones their date of application.  • Fundamental rights  Not applicable.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  Not applicable.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  Not applicable.  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  Not applicable.  2025/0129 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 as regards obligations of economic operators concerning battery due diligence policies  (Text with EEA relevance)  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee ( 3 ) ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 4 ) sets out battery due diligence obligations that cover the sourcing, processing and trading of cobalt, natural graphite, lithium and nickel used for battery manufacturing. Those due diligence obligations are to be applied from 18 August 2025.  (2) At a time when the geopolitical landscape continues to shift , v arious challenges need to be overcome , including in sourcing of raw materials. Battery manufacturers need time to analyse and , where necessary, adjust their supply chains as a result .  (3) The battery due diligence obligations include requirements for third-party verification by notified bodies . However, t he designation of notified bodies for battery due diligence policies is taking longer than expected. Due diligence s chemes recognised by the Commission in accordance with Article 53 of Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 would facilitate the work of economic operators and of notified bodies. However, due diligence s chemes addressing battery raw materials still need to be further developed and implemented, and then go through the recognition process.  (4) In order to provide sufficient time for the notification of conformity assessment bodies and to allow economic operators placing batteries on the market to be in a position to comply with their obligations, t he date of application of the battery due diligence policies set out in Regulation (EU) 2023/1542, should be postponed by two years.  (5) Directive (EU) 2024/1760 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 5 ) lays down rules and obligations to ensure that companies identify and address potential and actual adverse human rights and environmental impacts in the company’s own operations, the operations of their subsidiaries and, where related to their chain s of activities , the operations of their business partners.  (6) Th e Commission is to publish , in accordance with Article 48(5) Article of Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 , guidelines as regards the application of the due battery diligence requirements . The Commission is to make available , in accordance with Article 19(2), point (a) of Directive (EU) 2024/1760, guidelines as regards guidance and best practices on how to conduct due diligence . Consistency between Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 and Directive (EU) 2024/1760 is important for companies in the battery supply chain . Therefore, the relevant dates for the publication and making available of those guidelines should be harmonised .  (7) Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 should t herefore be amended accordingly .  (8) This Regulation should enter into force as a matter of urgency on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union and it should apply from 18 August 2025 in order to provide legal certainty with regard to the date of application of the due diligence obligations under Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 ,  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Article 1  Amendments to Regulation (EU) 2023/1542  Article 48 of Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 is amended as follows:  in paragraph 1, ‘18 August 2025’ is replaced by ‘18 August 2027’;  in paragraph 5, ‘18 February 2025’ is replaced by ‘26 July 2026’.  Article 2  Entry into force  This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union .  It shall apply from 18 August 2025.  This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.

Expected result(s) and impact  Specify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.  Companies have more time to prepare for the implementation of due diligence obligations, including third party verification. It also allows the Commission, at the level of guidance, to address coherence in implementation with the provisions of Directive (EU) 2024/1760.  1.3.4. Indicators of performance  Specify the indicators for monitoring progress and achievements.  The indicators for Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 remain the same.  1.4. The proposal/initiative relates to:  ☐ a new action  ☐ a new action following a pilot project/preparatory action ( 6 )   the extension of an existing action  ☐ a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action  1.5.

(As an agreement was reached between Parliament and Council, Parliament's position corresponds to the final legislative act, Regulation (EU) 2025/1561.)",,"REGULATION (EU) 2025/1561 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL
of 18 July 2025
amending Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 as regards obligations of economic operators concerning battery due diligence policies
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee(1),
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure(2),
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 of the European Parliament and of the Council(3)imposes battery due diligence obligations on economic operators that cover the sourcing, processing and trading of cobalt, natural graphite, lithium and nickel used for battery manufacturing. Those due diligence obligations are to be applied from 18 August 2025.
(2) At a time when the geopolitical landscape continues to shift, various challenges need to be overcome, including as regards sourcing of raw materials. As a result, battery manufacturers need time to analyse and, where necessary, adjust their supply chains.
(3) The battery due diligence obligations laid down in Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 include requirements covering third-party verification by notified bodies. However, the designation of such notified bodies is taking longer than expected. Due diligence schemes recognised by the Commission in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 would facilitate the work of economic operators and of notified bodies. However, due diligence schemes addressing raw materials present in batteries still need to be further developed and implemented, and subsequently go through the process of recognition of their equivalence by the Commission.
(4) In order to provide sufficient time for the notification of conformity assessment bodies and to allow economic operators placing batteries on the market to be in a position to comply with their obligations, the date of application of the battery due diligence obligations laid down in Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 should be postponed by two years.
(5) Directive (EU) 2024/1760 of the European Parliament and of the Council(4)lays down rules and obligations to ensure that companies identify and address actual and potential adverse human rights and environmental impacts in the company’s own operations, the operations of their subsidiaries and, where related to their chains of activities, the operations of their business partners.
(6) The Commission is to publish, in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2023/1542, guidelines as regards the application of the battery due diligence requirements. Furthermore, the Commission is to make available, in accordance with Directive (EU) 2024/1760, guidelines as regards guidance and best practices on how to conduct due diligence. Since consistency between Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 and Directive (EU) 2024/1760 is important for companies in the battery supply chain, the respective dates for the publication and making available of those guidelines should be harmonised.
(7) Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely to contribute to the efficient functioning of the internal market, while preventing and reducing the adverse impacts of batteries and waste batteries on the environment and ensure a high level of protection of human health, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of scale or effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
(8) Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(9) In view of the urgency of the matter and to provide legal certainty as soon as possible, it is considered to be appropriate to invoke the exception to the eight-week period provided for in Article 4 of Protocol No 1 on the role of national Parliaments in the European Union, annexed to the Treaty on European Union, to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community.
(10) This Regulation should enter into force as a matter of urgency on the day following that of its publication in theOfficial Journal of the European Union,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

Article 1

Article 48 of Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 is amended as follows:
(a) in paragraph 1, the date ‘18 August 2025’ is replaced by ‘18 August 2027’;
(b) in paragraph 5, the date ‘18 February 2025’ is replaced by ‘26 July 2026’.

Article 2

This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in theOfficial Journal of the European Union.
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.
Done at Brussels, 18 July 2025.",https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202501561,"The European Commission has proposed an amendment to existing legislation concerning the obligations of economic operators in the battery industry, focusing on enhancing due diligence policies. This proposal addresses challenges such as the complexities of sourcing raw materials and the need for third-party verification of due diligence policies. Initially, companies placing batteries on the market were required to adhere to specific environmental and health standards, verified by accredited bodies. However, many member states have not yet appointed the necessary authorities to oversee this process, and there is no established standard for accrediting these bodies.

To address these issues, the Commission suggests postponing the application date of these obligations by two years. This delay is intended to give companies more time to prepare and to resolve the current difficulties with the availability of accredited bodies. The proposal aligns with the European Green Deal's objectives and seeks to provide additional time for compliance without altering the substantive rules of the original regulation. It also considers the recent Directive on corporate sustainability due diligence, ensuring that the more specific requirements of the battery regulation take precedence where applicable. This approach aims to harmonize the obligations under both the battery regulation and the broader corporate sustainability directive.

The proposal also addresses consistency by harmonizing the publication dates for guidelines under both pieces of legislation, allowing them to be developed concurrently. The legal basis for this initiative is to prevent divergences that could hamper the free circulation of batteries within the EU. The Commission is tasked with publishing guidelines on the application of due diligence requirements and making available guidance and best practices.

CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  As seen in the recent unprecedented cyclone in Mayotte, natural disasters and severe meteorological events in the outermost regions of the E U are having a devastating effect on the populations living and working in these regions. Much of the agricultural and forestry production potential is destroyed every year , causing huge losses of income and threatening the food availability and security of these regions which already fac e permanent constraints on their development , as recognised in Article 349 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. In fact, wh ile these regions are quite different from one another, they share some specificities, such as remoteness, insularity 1 , mostly small size, increased vulnerability to climate change, economies dependent on a few sectors, with high levels of unemployment , and gross domestic product (GDP) significantly below EU and national averages . All these constraints render the recovery of the agricultural production destroyed by severe natural disasters even more difficult and the severity of the natural disasters render the time of recovery even longer .  In its Communication “ Putting people first, securing sustainable and inclusive growth, unlocking the potential of the EU’s outermost regions” 2 , the Commission committed to reflecting the outermost regions’ specificities across all EU policies, including agriculture 3 . Some of the challenges of the agricultural sector in the outermost regions are already addressed in a specific way through Regulation (EU) No 228/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council 4 . H owever, in the face of ever more severe natural disasters in these regions, the need for further flexibilities was identified. In order to address the cash-flow challenges during the reconstruction of agricultural production after the frequent devastating natural disasters in outermost regions , Europe needs to be able to rapidly deploy effective support and more flexibility through the POSEI referred to in that Regulation . This involves programme s of options specifically relating to remoteness and insularity laying down specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of the Union by ensuring continuity of POSEI support to the beneficiaries during the restoration period, irrespective of the level of their activity, but subject to formal commitment s to restore their capacity . On 14 December 2024, the outermost region of Mayotte was hit by th e deadly cyclone Chido , causing widespread destruction and casualties everywhere in its path, devastat ing thousands of homes and cut ting off the water and electricity supplies . Roads, communications networks and health infrastructures were seriously affected or put out of service . O n 11 January 2025 , Mayotte was also struck by the tropical storm Dikeledi , with heavy rain and local flooding compounding the damage caused by Chido . The effects of Chido on agriculture and f ood s ecurity were significant: strong winds destroyed crops in many area s, f armlands were flooded , disrupt ing planting schedules, which will lead to lower yields for the next growing season . In addition, Chido d est royed infrastructure, such as roads, hamper ing the transportation of agricultural goods . For the first time , France declared a state of exceptional natural disaster.  Consequently, the last year of the implementation of the Rural Development Programme in Mayotte for the programming period 2014-2022 (RDP Mayotte) was heavily affected. Many projects, in particular investments, will be delayed or abandoned. In addition, in the first instance, farmers and other actors in agriculture need liquidity support to be able to make a living until the restoration of their holdings has occurred, as well as the restoration of their production potential.  Regulation (EU) 2024/3242 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 December 2024 5 amending Regulation (EU) 2020/2220 of the European Parliament and of the Council 6 introduced a new exceptional and temporary measure ( inserted in Article 6a of Regulation (EU) 2020/2220 ) which allows Member States to provide liquidity support to farmers, forest holders, as well as SMEs active in processing agricultural and forestry products , affected by natural disasters occurring as of 1 January 2024.  Pursuant to the current rules, an upper ceiling of maximum 10% of EAFRD funds for 2021-2022 (excluding EURI) can be allocated to this measure (1.5 M€ for Mayotte). To provide an adequate response to the exceptional natural disasters occurred in Mayotte, it is proposed to remove this ceiling of 10% and allow Mayotte to reallocate 2021-2022 EAFRD funds for the support provided under measure pursuant to Article 6a of Regulation (EU) 2020/2220.  In the context of this measure, the deadline for the approval of the applications is set to 30/06/2025 7 in order to provide swift reaction to natural disasters and quick liquidity to those in need . However, given that this proposal will change the conditions of this measure for Mayotte, it is necessary t o provide sufficient time to the Managing authority of Mayotte to select the beneficiaries once this regulation enters into force . For this reason, the deadline for approval of the applications should not apply. Nonetheless, the eligibility of expenses (31 December 2025) as defined in Regulation (UE) 130 3 /2013 8 remains unchanged. This means that the payments to the beneficiaries have to be made by 31 December 2025.  Further, the Commission proposes to introduce a derogation to capping of measure pursuant to Article 6a of Regulation (EU) 2020/2220 for Mayotte, which will allow the outermost region to effectively address the liquidity needs of the rural population heavily damaged in the described natural disasters. This derogation should be done through specific provisions of POSEI Regulation in order to keep this derogation limited to the specific needs of the outermost region of Mayotte.  Therefore, in order to provide the above-described additional assistance and further flexibility to outermost regions affected by natural disasters, the Commission proposes a targeted modification of the POSEI Regulation which lays down specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of the Union.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  The proposal is consistent with the overall legal framework established for the Common Agricultural Policy and the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) and is limited to a targeted amendment of Regulation (EU) No 228/2013.  • Consistency with other Union policies  The proposal is limited to targeted amendments of Regulation (EU) No 228/2013 and maintains consistency with other Union policies.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  The proposal is based on Articles 42, 43(2) and 349 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union provides that the competence for agriculture is shared between the Union and the Member States, while establishing a common agricultural policy with common objectives and a common implementation. The proposal aims at ensuring further flexibilities to Outermost regions affected by natural disasters or severe meteorological events.  • Proportionality  The proposal comprises limited and targeted amendments that do not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objective of providing exceptional and temporary relief to farmers, forest holders, SMEs and holdings active in processing, marketing or development of agricultural products or forestry products and for restoration efforts, who are particularly affected by natural disasters.  • Choice of the instrument  A Regulation is the appropriate instrument to introduce the flexibility needed to address these unprecedented circumstances.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  N/A  • Stakeholder consultations  Due to the technical, limited and urgent nature of the proposed modifications, the wide public consultation is not required.  • Collection and use of expertise  N/A  • Impact assessment  Due to the technical nature and targeted scope of the initiative, the impact assessment is not required.  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  N/A  • Fundamental rights  N/A  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  This new proposal does not imply any changes in the Multiannual Financial Framework annual ceilings for commitments and payments as per Annex I of Regulation (EU) No 2020/2093. The annual breakdown of commitment appropriations for the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development E.08030102 remains unchanged.  Overall, this measure does not imply the need for extra payment appropriations. The necessary payment appropriations of EUR 13.5 million in 2025 and 2026 payment appropriations are foreseen to be offset by decommitments at closure expected to take place in 2026. Funds allocated to other Rural Development Programmes (RPDs) that will remain unused will be decommitted and will compensate for the additional costs under this amendment.  As regards POSEI support, this proposal does not have any quantifiable budgetary impact. Any related expenditure will remain under the annual Member State financial allocation for POSEI.  .5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation, and reporting arrangements  The implementation of the measures will be monitored and reported upon in the framework of the reporting mechanisms established in Regulations (EU) No 1303/2013 , (EU) No 1305/2013 9 and (EU) 228/2013.  • Explanatory documents (for directives)  N/A  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  In order to provide further flexibilities to the outermost regions affected by natural disasters and severe meteorological events and to provide an adequate response to the impact of the unprecedented natural disaster Chido in Mayotte on the farmers, other EAFRD beneficiaries and the administrations it is proposed to amend Regulation (EU) No 228/2013 as follows:  · Allow the competent national authorities to submit an exceptional programme modification to their POSEI programme while they apply the principle of force majeure or exceptional circumstances where, as a result of the unexpected severe natural disaster, the agricultural production capacity was seriously or totally destroyed, and the restoration of certain sectors requires a longer period than could be covered by the application of the principle of force majeure or exceptional circumstances. This would allow the beneficiaries concerned to continue to receive POSEI support during the restoration period, irrespective of the level of their activity, but subject to their formal commitment to restore their agricultural production capacity . The implementation of this programme modification will be subject to annual review and monitoring of progress in close cooperation between the Commission and the Member State.  · For the rural development programme of Mayotte, r emove the limit of 10% of the 2021 and 2022 budgetary allocations for temporary support in response to the impact of natural disasters to be funded under the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and allow the s election of the beneficiaries beyond the deadline of 30 June 2025.  · Compliance with the digital-by-default principle  · According to the digital assessment carried out, the current proposal has no digital dimensions as there is no digital relevance. Digital means or data exchange are not under the scope of the proposal.  2025/0104 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulation (EU) No 228/2013 as regards additional assistance and further flexibility to outermost regions affected by severe natural disasters and in the context of cyclone Chido devastating Mayotte  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 42, Article 43(2) and Article 349 thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 10 ,  Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions 11 ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) On 18 December 2024 , an “exceptional natural disaster” was declared for the outermost region of Mayotte following the devastating consequences of c yclone Chido , that d estroyed much of the agricultural and forestry potential of the island and threatened food availability and security . Th is unprecedented cyclone and other recent natural disasters in the outermost regions of the Union as de scribed in Article 349 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) , demonstrate the vulnerability of the se regions to the effects of climate change, including the increased risk of exceptional natural disasters or severe meteorological events with long-term consequence s .  (2) I n order to address and mi tigate the impact of exceptional natural disasters or severe meteorological events in the outermost regions of the Union , in particular as regard s the support to local production provided through the Programme of Options Specifically Relating to Remoteness and Insularity (POSEI) referred to in Regulation (EU) No 228/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council 12 ; it is appropriate to provide for the possibility for the affected beneficiaries to continue to receive POSEI payments during the restoration period irrespective of the level of their activity, subject to a formal commitment to restore their capacity . It should therefore be provided for that t he competent national authorities may decide on the application of force majeure or exceptional circumstances on the basis of relevant evidence. At the same time, in duly justified circumstances, where the restoration of certain sectors requires a longer period, it should be provided for that an exceptional programme amendment, subject to annual review and monitoring of progress, may extend this restoration period beyond what could be covered by the application of the principle of force majeure or exceptional circumstances. For this purpose, Articles 6 and 19 of Regulation (EU) No 228/2013 should be amended.  (3) I n addition , in order to quickly address the vulnerabilities of Mayotte’s food system and rural communities resulting from that unprecedented natural disaster caused by cyclone Chido ; it is appropriate to rapidly provide exceptional effective support through the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development ( EAFRD ) , and to provide for more flexibility in the existing rules. Article 6a of Regulation (EU) 2020/2220 of the European Parliament and of the Council 13 introduced a new measure providing exceptional temporary support in response to the impact of natural disasters to be funded under the EAFRD within the legal framework applicable in the programming period 2014-2020, as extended by that Regulation. In order to allow Mayotte to respond to the consequences of cyclone Chido and taking into account the difficulties caused by the specific situation of this o utermost region , the application of the measure introduced by Article 6a of Regulation (EU) 2020/2220 in Mayotte sh ou l d be established. As the specific difficulties of responding to the exceptional situation in Mayotte are linked to its remoteness as an outermost region as described in Article 349 TFEU , it is appropriate to provide for the flexibilities of the EAFRD support through the establishment of a specific legal framework for the additional support of the outermost regions. For this purpose, Article 22 of Regulation (EU) No 228/2013 should be amended.  (4) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely to address and mitigate the impact of natural disasters on the agri-food and forestry sectors in the outermost regions by providing additional flexibilities after exceptional natural disasters or severe meteorological events and in particular, after c yclone Chido in Mayotte , cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but can rather be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.  (5) Regulation (EU) No 228/2013 should therefore be amended accordingly.  (6) In view of the devasting effects of the current natural disasters and the urgency of addressing and mitigating their impact on the agri-food and forestry sectors in outermost regions , as well as the urgency in applying the measure pursuant to Article 6a of Regulation (EU) 2020/2220 before the end of the programming period 2014-202 0 , as extended by Regulation (EU) 2020/2220 it is considered to be appropriate to invoke the exception to the eight- week period provided for in Article 4 of Protocol No 1 on the role of national Parliaments in the European Union, annexed to the TEU, to the T FEU and to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community .  (7) In order to ensure a smooth implementation of these amendments and as a matter of urgency in view of the pressing need to address and mitigate the impact of exceptional natural disasters or severe meteorological events in the outermost territories of the Union , and in particular, that of c yclone Chido in Mayotte , this Regulation should enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union ,  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Article 1  Regulation (EU) No 228/2013 is amended as follows:  (1) in Article 6, the following paragraph 5 is added:  ‘5. In the event of exceptional natural disasters or severe meteorological events which destroy totally or partially the agricultural production capacity in an outermost region, Member States may submit a proposal to amend the programme, while applying the principle of force majeure or exceptional circumstances in order to allow the beneficiaries concerned to continue to receive POSEI support throughout the restoration period in the form of measures to assist local agricultural production provided for in Article 19. The implementation of these programme modifications shall be subject to an annual review and monitoring of progress in close cooperation between the Commission and the Member State.’;  (2) in Article 19, the following paragraph 5 is added:  ‘5. When a programme is amended in accordance with Article 6(5), beneficiaries affected by the exceptional natural disaster or the severe meteorological event may continue to benefit from support in the form of measures to support production, processing or sale provided for in paragraph 4 of this Article irrespective of their level of activity throughout the restoration period, but subject to a formal commitment to restore their agricultural production capacity.’;  (3) in Article 22, the following paragraphs 3 and 4 are added:  ‘3. By way of derogation from Article 6a (5) of Regulation (EU) 2020/2220 of the European Parliament and of the Council*, Mayotte may approve applications for support after 30 June 2025.  4. In the rural development programme of Mayotte, the EAFRD support provided for the measure referred to in Article 6a of Regulation (EU) 2020/2220 shall not exceed the total EAFRD contribution to that rural development programme for the years 2021–2022.  * Regulation (EU) 2020/2220 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 December 2020 laying down certain transitional provisions for support from the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and from the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) in the years 2021 and 2022 and amending Regulations (EU) No 1305/2013, (EU) No 1306/2013 and (EU) No 1307/2013 as regards resources and application in the years 2021 and 2022 and Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 as regards resources and the distribution of such support in respect of the years 2021 and 2022 (OJ L 437, 28.12.2020, p. 1, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2020/2220/oj ). ’ .

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 42, Article 43(2) and Article 349 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee(1),
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure(2),
Whereas:
(1) On 18 December 2024, an exceptional natural disaster was declared for Mayotte following the devastating consequences of cyclone Chido, which destroyed much of the agricultural and forestry potential of the island, and threatened the availability of food and its security. That unprecedented cyclone and other recent natural disasters in the outermost regions of the Union within the meaning of Article 349 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) (the ‘outermost regions’) demonstrate the vulnerability of those regions to the effects of climate change, which include an increased risk of exceptional natural disasters and severe meteorological events with long-term consequences.
(2) In order to address and mitigate the impact of exceptional natural disasters or severe meteorological events in the outermost regions, in particular as regards the support for local production provided through the Programme of Options Specifically Relating to Remoteness and Insularity (‘the POSEI programme’) referred to in Regulation (EU) No 228/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council(3), it should be possible for affected beneficiaries to continue to receive POSEI programme payments throughout the restoration period, irrespective of the level of their activity, subject to a formal commitment to restore their capacity. Competent national authorities should therefore be able to decide, on the basis of relevant evidence, on the application of the principle offorce majeureor exceptional circumstances. It should also be possible, in exceptional and duly justified circumstances, for Member States to submit proposals to amend the POSEI programme, in order to extend the restoration period for certain sectors beyond the period that would be justified by the application of the principle offorce majeureor exceptional circumstances. The implementation of such amendments should be subject to an annual review and the monitoring of progress. Therefore, Articles 6 and 19 of Regulation (EU) No 228/2013 should be amended accordingly.
(3) In addition, in order to quickly address the vulnerabilities of Mayotte’s food system, and the other challenges for its rural communities, resulting from the unprecedented natural disaster caused by cyclone Chido, it is appropriate to provide, rapidly and on an exceptional basis, effective support through the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), and to provide for additional flexibility in the application of the existing rules. Article 6a of Regulation (EU) 2020/2220 of the European Parliament and of the Council(4)introduced a new measure providing exceptional temporary support in response to the impact of natural disasters to be funded under the EAFRD within the legal framework applicable in the programming period 2014-2020, as extended by that Regulation. In order to enable Mayotte to respond to the consequences of cyclone Chido, taking into account the difficulties caused by its specific situation as an outermost region, it is necessary to establish how the measure under Article 6a of Regulation (EU) 2020/2220 is to be applied to Mayotte. As the specific difficulties of responding to the exceptional situation in Mayotte are linked to its remoteness as an outermost region, the flexibility making additional EAFRD support possible should be provided through the establishment of a specific legal framework for the outermost regions. Therefore, Article 22 of Regulation (EU) No 228/2013 should be amended accordingly.
(4) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely to address and mitigate the impact of natural disasters on the agri-food and forestry sectors in the outermost regions by providing additional flexibilities after exceptional natural disasters or severe meteorological events and, in particular, after cyclone Chido in Mayotte, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but can rather be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.
(5) Regulation (EU) No 228/2013 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(6) In view of the devastating effects of the current natural disasters and the urgency of addressing and mitigating their impact on the agri-food and forestry sectors in the outermost regions, as well as the urgency in applying the measure referred to in Article 6a of Regulation (EU) 2020/2220 before the end of the programming period 2014–2020, as extended by that Regulation, it is considered to be appropriate to invoke the exception to the eight-week period provided for in Article 4 of Protocol No 1 on the role of national Parliaments in the European Union, annexed to the TEU, to the TFEU and to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community.
(7) In order to ensure the smooth implementation of amendments to Regulation (EU) No 228/2013 and as a matter of urgency in view of the pressing need to address and mitigate the impact of exceptional natural disasters or severe meteorological events in the outermost regions, and in particular that of cyclone Chido in Mayotte, this Regulation should enter into force on the day of its publication in theOfficial Journal of the European Union,

Article 2

This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in theOfficial Journal of the European Union.
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.
Done at Brussels, 24 June 2025.",https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202501276,"The European Commission has proposed a legislative change aimed at providing additional assistance and flexibility to the outermost regions of the European Union, particularly in response to severe natural disasters like Cyclone Chido, which devastated Mayotte in 2024. This proposal seeks to amend existing regulations to better support these regions, which face unique challenges due to their remoteness, insularity, and economic dependence on limited sectors. These challenges are often exacerbated by frequent natural disasters that severely impact agriculture and infrastructure, making recovery difficult and prolonged.

To address these issues, the proposal enhances the Programme for the Organization of Support for the Economies of the Outermost Regions (POSEI), which provides financial support to these areas. Key changes include removing the cap on funds allocated for liquidity support to farmers and other agricultural stakeholders affected by natural disasters, allowing regions like Mayotte to reallocate more resources for recovery efforts. Additionally, the proposal extends the deadline for approving applications for this support, recognizing the need for a swift response to natural disasters and the time required for managing authorities to select beneficiaries.

The proposal also introduces a derogation to the capping of measures for Mayotte, allowing the region to address the liquidity needs of its rural population more effectively. This derogation is limited to the specific needs of Mayotte and is intended to provide targeted assistance without altering the overall legal framework of the Common Agricultural Policy and the European Structural and Investment Funds.

For Mayotte's rural development program, the proposal removes the limit on the percentage of budgetary allocations"

As the EU advances its twin transition towards climate neutrality and digital leadership, the resilience and global competitiveness of this sector have become even more essential.  Regulatory burdens are one of the two top problems named by businesses operating in the EU when it comes to the investment climate. The high-level reports of Enrico Letta 1 and Mario Draghi placed the reduction of the regulatory burdens and simplification of EU legislation among the top priorities. Overregulation is seen by more than 60% of EU companies as an obstacle to investment, with 55% of SMEs naming regulatory obstacles and the administrative burden as their greatest challenge 2 .  I n her political guidelines for the European Commission’s 2024–2029 mandate 3 , President von der Leyen outlined a vision focused on driving sustainable prosperity and strengthening competitiveness across Europe. Central to this vision are efforts to streamline business operations and further integrate the Single Market.  Complementing this, the European Commission’s b etter regulation agenda 4 seeks to enhance the competitiveness of EU businesses by ensuring that legislation achieves its goals efficiently, without placing undue burdens on stakeholders.  Following th o se commitment s , the European Commission put forward an initiative 5 aim ing at simplifying and streamlining certain requirements and procedures for chemical products laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures 6 (‘CLP R egulation’) , Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 on cosmetic products 7 and Regulation (EU) 2019/1009 laying down rules on the making available on the market of EU fertilising products 8 identified as particularly burdensome by industry and authorities . These provisions would benefit from regulatory streamlining and modernisation, which w ould make chemical legislation more efficient and cost-effective for industry , while at the same time ensuring a hi gh level of protection of human health and the environment .  With regard to the CLP R egulation , which requires economic operators to classify, label and package their hazardous chemicals appropriately before placing them on the market , the initiative is seeking to simplify the formatting rules laid down for the labelling of hazardous chemicals and make them more flexible. This i nclud es rules on mandatory minimum font sizes and line spacing, which were identified being particularly burdensome and costly for industry 9 . It also aims to clarify rules on derogations from labelling requirements for smaller packag es and rules on the labelling of fuel pumps. T o alleviate the burden on businesses and improve the free circulation of substances and mixtures in the internal market without undermining the protection of human health and the environment, th e initiative also seeks to reduce the scope of provisions on advertisements and distance sales that relate to products placed on the market for the general public, taking into account the fact that Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 10 (‘REACH’) already provides clear obligations on information flows in professional supply chains for substances and mixtures. Furthermore, it seeks to l oosen obligations for advertisements of hazardous substances and mixtures by reducing the amount of information to be provided . In addition, it suggests removing the fixed six - month deadline for updat ing the label, while maintaining the more flexible requirement to ensure the label is updated without undue delay, as the period of six months appeared to be impossible to comply with in the complex supply chains. Finally , it proposes to broaden the use of digital labelling , allowing more pieces of information to be provided on the digital label only .  T he current proposal aims to postpon e the dates of application of the mandatory formatting requirements, provisions on advertisements and distance sales , obligations laying down six- month deadlines for the label update and rules on the labelling of fuel pumps introduced by Regulation (EU) 2024/2865 11 to provide legal certainty for businesses and to avoid having different application dates for the same type of obligations imposed on businesses by two amending acts to the CLP Regulation .  1.2. Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  The proposal is part of a package of measures on simplification that aim to streamline certain procedures and reduce administrative burden and costs for industries to ensure a well-functioning Single Market for chemicals while ensuring the same level of protection of human health and of the environment.  This proposal contains provisions that are intended to reduce the burden for Member States and industry, with the aim of making the three amended pieces of legislation easier to apply and less burdensome.  1.3. Consistency with other EU policies  Under the regulatory fitness and performance programme (REFIT), the Commission ensures that its legislation is fit for purpose, is tailored to the needs of stakeholders and minimises burdens while achieving its objectives. This proposal is therefore part of the REFIT programme, aimed at reducing reporting burdens arising from EU legislation.  This proposal is part of a series of simplification packages.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  2.1. Legal basis  This proposal has as its legal basis Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union in line with the original legal bases for the adoption of the legal acts which this proposal aims to amend.  2.2. Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  The Regulation (EU) 2024/2865 was adopted at EU level. Accordingly, amendments to this regulation need to be made at EU level.  2.3. Proportionality  The initiative does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives of simplification and burden reduction without lowering the protection of human health and environment.  2.4. Choice of the instrument  This proposal amends Regulation (EU) 2024/2865 adopted by ordinary legislative procedure and therefore the amendments of that Regulation need to be adopted by a regulation in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure.  3. RESULTS OF EX POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  3.1. Ex post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  This proposal is accompanied by a Commission staff working document that includes a detailed overview of the impact of provisions of chemical legislation that are proposed to be amended. It also provides an analysis of the positive impacts of the proposed measures, based on existing data, information gathered during the various Reality Checks and written inputs received from stakeholders, also taking into account previous analyses, such as the Fitness Check of the most relevant chemicals legislation and the impact assessment for the CLP revision.  3.2. Stakeholder consultations  V arious suggestions for simplifying or clarifying certain provisions of chemical legislation and removing the excessive administrative burden stemming from these provisions have emerged through stakeholders’ proposals for the simplification of European chemical legislation 12 .  On 16 May 2025, the European Commission held a Reality Check, aiming to gather practical feedback on the revised CLP Regulation. It was held online and draw over 570 participants from industry, consumer and environmental groups, legal practitioners, and national authorities. The event focused on identifying opportunities for simplification following the adoption of Regulation (EU) 2024/2865, while keeping the same level of protection of human health and of the environment. Stakeholders were invited to share concrete experiences and proposals on how to make the new rules more workable, particularly in operational and multilingual contexts.  Among various suggestions of stakeholders, strong calls to ‘stop the clock’ on implementation of certain provisions of Regulation 2024/2865 that create excessive administrative burden were repeated throughout the discussion. Stakeholders highlighted the need to ensure legal clarity for businesses until any Commission proposal for the revision of those rules is agreed by co-legislators  3.3. Collection and use of expertise  Different suggestions for clarifying certain provisions of chemical legislation and removing the excessive administrative burden stemming from these provisions have emerged through stakeholders’ proposals for simplification of European chemical legislation. Furthermore, in response to the Reality Checks mentioned above, the Commission received more than 150 detailed position papers from stakeholders, supporting the views expressed during the event and providing additional suggestions, data and costs estimates. Detailed summaries of these consultation activities and the input received are attached to the staff working document accompanying this proposal.  3.4. Impact assessment  Given the urgent need to reduce administrative burden and excessive costs for businesses and the lack of policy options, it has not been possible to prepare a full impact assessment.  However, following better regulation principles, this proposal is accompanied by a Commission staff working document that includes an analysis of the proposed measures, based on existing data, inputs received from stakeholders and previous analyses, such as the Fitness Check of the most relevant chemicals legislation and the impact assessment for the CLP revision.  3.5. Regulatory fitness and simplification  This proposal is part of the European Commission’s commitment to lighten the regulatory burden for people, businesses and administrations in the EU to boost prosperity and resilience of the EU. The proposal aims to provide legal clarity for businesses and ensure that rules imposed by different EU acts to the same type of obligations are consistently taking effect from the same date.  3.6. Fundamental rights  The proposal respects the fundamental rights enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union 13 and adheres to the principles recognised therein . The reduction of administrative burden on companies should lead to societal gains in terms of wealth creation, employment and innovation. At the same time, the proposal seeks to ensure a high level of protection of human health and of the environment.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  This initiative will not imply any additional costs for the Commission.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  5.1. Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  The Commission will monitor the implementation and application of new provisions and compliance with them. This proposal does not require an implementation plan.  5.2. Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  The proposal amends Article 2 of the Regulation (EU) 2024/2865 that sets the dates of entry into force and entry into application of the provisions of that Regulation.  Provisions amending Article 30 laying down timelines for relabelling, Article 48 on advertisements, Article 48a on distance sales and provisions on labelling of fuel pumps in Annex II are removed from the list of provisions that will apply as of 1 July 2026 as outlined in paragraph 2 of Article 2.  Similarly, provisions amending Article 31(3) and relevant sections of Annex I on mandatory formatting requirements are removed from the list of provisions that will apply as of 1 January 2027 as outlined in paragraph 3 of Article 2.  A new paragraph 3a is inserted in Article 2 laying down a new application date of 1 January 2028 for all abovementioned provisions.  Consequently, the provisions that are subject to extended deferred application dates are removed from the provision that allows the voluntary application of the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2024/2865 before their entry into application in paragraphs 4 and 5 of Article 2, and moved to a new paragraph 5a, aligning the date of the application of that provision with the new deferred application date.  The application dates of other provisions of Regulation (EU) 2024/2865 remain unchanged.  2025/0526 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulation (EU) 2024/2865 as regards dates of application and transitional provisions  (Text with EEA relevance)  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national Parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 14 ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council 15 contains certain requirements as regards the classification, labelling , and packaging of hazardous substances and mixtures. That Regulation was amended by Regulation (EU) 2024/2865 of the European Parliament and of the Council 16 , which inter alia introduced specific rules on the formatting of labels, deadlines for relabelling in case of classification changes, information requirements for advertisements and distance sales offers and labelling requirements for fuelling station s . Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2024/2865 deferred the date of application of those rules.  (2) T he 2024 Draghi report 17 highlighted that the number and the complexity of rules risk limit ing the room for manoeuvre for U nion undertakings and prevent ing them from remaining competitive . A detailed analysis of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 18 also pointed to excessive administrative burden and costs associated with requirements introduced by Regulation (EU) 2024/2865 . Based on those findings , the Commission has laid down a proposal to simplify certain requirements and procedures for chemical products 19 . That proposal is, inter alia , intended to better balanc e, on the one hand, the need for label information to be clearly understood by consumers and, on the other hand, the need to reduce market barriers and administrative burden for industry 20 . In light of that proposal , it is necessary to further defer the obligations on label formatting , advertisements, distance sales offers and relabelling that were introduced by Regulation (EU) 2024/2865 . Such further deferral would enable economic operators to prepare for changes to the formatting and labelling requirements , as well as new information requirements for advertisements and distance sales offers envisaged in the Commission ’s proposal.  (3) Regulation (EU) 2024/2865 introduced specific provisions for the labelling of fuels supplied at fuelling stations. However, certain requirements, including the requirement to indicate the supplier, the nominal quantity, and the unique formula identifier, appeared to be impractical and costly for undertakings, without bringing benefits to the protection of human health and the environment. For that reason, the Commission proposal as regards simplification of certain requirements and procedures for chemical products intends to modify those requirements to make them more apt by removing unnecessary and burdensome labelling requirements. In light of those anticipated modifications, it is appropriate to further defer the date of application of those requirements .  (4) Article 2(4) and (5) of Regulation (EU) 2024/2865 contain transitional provisions that enable undertakings to apply the provisions introduced by that Regulation before the dates of their applica tion on a voluntary basis. To ensur e consistency with the longer deferr al and to provid e legal clarity for economic operators , it is necessary to amend the dates of application of th o se transitional provisions on mandatory formatting requirements, relabelling, advertisements, distance offers and labelling of fuelling stations and align those dates with the extend ed deferred applicability dates .  (5) T o ensur e a high level of protection of human health and the environment, the application dates of other provisions of Regulation (EU) 2024/2865 should remain unchanged.  (6) Regulation (E U ) 20 24 / 2865 should therefore be amended accordingly ,  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Article 1  Amendments to Regulation (EU) 2024/2865  Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2024/2865 is amended as follows:  (1) p aragraph 2 is replaced by the following:  ‘2.

(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee(1),
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure(2),
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council(3)sets out certain requirements as regards the classification, labelling, and packaging of substances and mixtures. That Regulation was amended by Regulation (EU) 2024/2865 of the European Parliament and of the Council(4), which, inter alia, introduced specific rules on the formatting of labels, deadlines for relabelling in case of changes in classification, information requirements for advertisements and distance sales offers and labelling requirements for filling stations. Regulation (EU) 2024/2865 also deferred the date of application of those rules.
(2) The 2024 report entitled ‘The future of European competitiveness’ (the Draghi report) highlighted that the number and the complexity of rules risk limiting the room for manoeuvre for Union undertakings and preventing them from remaining competitive. A detailed analysis of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 also pointed to excessive administrative burden and costs associated with requirements introduced by Regulation (EU) 2024/2865. Based on those findings, the Commission has proposed to simplify certain requirements and procedures for chemical products(5). That proposal is intended, inter alia, to balance better, on the one hand, the need for labelling information to be clearly understood by consumers and, on the other hand, the need to reduce market barriers and administrative burden for industry, as expressed in the Commission Communication entitled ‘The Single Market: our European home market in an uncertain world, a strategy for making the Single Market simple, seamless and strong’. In light of that proposal, it is necessary to further defer the obligations introduced by Regulation (EU) 2024/2865 on formatting of labels, advertisements, distance sales offers and relabelling. Such further deferral would enable economic operators to prepare for changes to the formatting and labelling requirements, as well as new information requirements for advertisements and distance sales offers envisaged in the Commission’s proposal.
(3) Regulation (EU) 2024/2865 introduced specific provisions for the labelling of fuels supplied at filling stations. However, certain requirements, including the requirement to indicate the supplier, the nominal quantity, and the unique formula identifier, appeared to be impractical and costly for undertakings, without bringing any benefit to the protection of human health and the environment. Therefore, the Commission intends to modify those requirements to make them more apt by removing unnecessary and burdensome labelling requirements. In light of those anticipated modifications, it is appropriate to further defer the date of application of those requirements.
(4) Regulation (EU) 2024/2865 contains transitional provisions that enable undertakings to apply, on a voluntary basis, the new rules introduced by that Regulation before the dates of their application. To ensure consistency with the longer deferral and to provide legal clarity for economic operators, it is necessary to amend the dates of application of those transitional provisions on mandatory formatting requirements, relabelling, advertisements, distance sales offers and labelling of filling stations and align them with the extended deferred applicability dates.
(5) To ensure a high level of protection of human health and the environment, the application dates of other provisions of Regulation (EU) 2024/2865 should remain unchanged.
(6) Regulation (EU) 2024/2865 should therefore be amended accordingly,

Done at Strasbourg, 26 November 2025.",https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202502439,"The European Commission has proposed a regulation aimed at modernizing and simplifying the legislative framework governing chemical products within the EU. This initiative is part of a broader effort to reduce regulatory burdens and streamline processes for businesses, particularly in the chemical industry, which is vital for the EU's economy and innovation. The proposal seeks to amend existing regulations related to the classification, labeling, and packaging of chemical substances, mixtures, cosmetic products, and fertilizing products.

Key aspects of the proposal include making labeling requirements for hazardous chemicals more flexible, addressing costly issues such as mandatory font sizes and line spacing. It also aims to simplify labeling for smaller packages and fuel pumps, and ease obligations related to advertisements and distance sales of chemical products, recognizing that existing regulations already cover professional supply chains effectively. Additionally, the proposal suggests removing the fixed six-month deadline for updating labels, allowing updates to occur without undue delay, and expanding the use of digital labeling to provide more information digitally.

To ensure a smooth transition, the proposal outlines specific application dates for the new requirements, aiming to provide legal certainty and consistency across different regulations. It also addresses specific formatting requirements and deadlines for relabeling in case of classification changes, as well as information requirements for advertisements and distance sales offers. The proposal seeks to balance the clarity of label information for consumers with the need to reduce market barriers and administrative burdens for the industry.

sustainability reporting and due diligence requirements  (Text with EEA relevance)  {SWD(2025) 80}  EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM  1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  General context and objectives  In his report on ‘The Future of European Competitiveness’, Mario Draghi emphasised the need for Europe to create a regulatory landscape which facilitates competitiveness and resilience , drawing attention to burden and compliance costs created by the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive ( CSRD ) and the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive ( CSDDD ) . 1 In the Budapest Declaration on the New European Competitiveness Deal, EU Heads of State and Government called for ‘ a simplification revolution, ensuring a clear, simple and smart regulatory framework for businesses and drastically reducing administrative, regulatory and reporting burdens, in particular for SMEs ’ . 2 They called on the Commission to make concrete proposals to reduce reporting requirements by at least 25% in the first half of 2025.  In its Communication on the Competitive Compass for the EU, the Commission confirmed that it would propose a first ‘ Simplification Omnibus package ’ which would include far-reaching simplification in the fields of sustainable finance reporting, sustainability due diligence and taxonomy. 3 In its Communication entitled ‘A simpler and faster Europe: Communication on implementation and simplification’, the Commission set out an implementation and simplification agenda that delivers fast and visible improvements for people and business on the ground , requiring more than an incremental approach and underlining the need for bold action to streamline and simplify EU, national and regional rules. 4  The CSRD entered into force on 5 January 2023 . 5 It strengthened and modernised corporate sustainability reporting requirements through modifications to the Accounting Directive, the Transparency Directive, the Audit Directive and the Audit Regulation. 6 The CSRD is an important element of the European Green Deal and of the Sustainable Finance Action Plan . 7 It aims to ensure that investors have the information they need to understand and manage the risks to which investee companies are exposed from climate change and other sustainability issues . It also aims to ensure that investors and other stakeholders have the information they need about the impacts of companies on people and the environment. It thereby contributes to financial stability and environmental integrity. This is a necessary condition for financial resources to flow to companies that pursue sustainability goals and creates more accountability and transparency towards all stakeholders regarding companies’ sustainability performance.  The CSDDD was adopted on 13 June 2024. Its objective is to contribute to the European Union's broader ambition to transition towards a sustainable and climate-neutral economy as outlined in the European Green Deal. It requires companies to identify and address adverse human rights and environmental impacts in their own operations, those of their subsidiaries and their chains of activities.  The CSRD and the CSDDD are now being implemented in a new and difficult context. Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine has driven up energy prices for EU undertakings. Trade tensions are rising as the geopolitical landscape continues to shift. The different approach undertaken by some other major jurisdictions regarding the regulation of corporate sustainability reporting and due diligence raises questions about the effects of these laws on the competitive positioning of EU companies. The ability of the Union to preserve and protect its values depends amongst other things on the capacity of its economy to adapt and compete in an unstable and sometimes hostile geopolitical context.  This proposal therefore postpones the entry into application of the CSDDD and of certain provisions of the CSRD.  Specific context and objectives of this proposal regarding the CSRD  The CSRD currently applies to large undertakings , SMEs with securities listed on the EU regulated markets, parent undertakings of large groups , as well as to issuers that belong to these categories of undertakings . The entry into application of the reporting requirements introduced by the CSRD is phased in according to different categories of undertakings. In the first wave, large public interest entities with more than 500 employees must report for the first time in 2025 for financial year 2024. 8 In the second wave, the other large undertakings must report in 2026 for financial year 2025. 9 In the third wave, SMEs with securities listed in EU regulated markets must report in 2027 for financial year 2026, although they have a possibility to opt out of reporting for financial years 2026 and 2027. 10 In the fourth wave, certain non-EU undertakings that have business in the territory of the Union above certain thresholds must report in 2029 for financial year 2028. 11  The CSRD requires undertakings in scope to report sustainability information according to mandatory European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) and requires the Commission to adopt such standards through delegated acts. In July 2023 t he Commission adopted a first set of ESRS which are sector-agnostic, meaning they are to be applied by all undertakings in scope independently of the sector of the economy in which the undertaking operates. 12 The CSRD also requires the Commission to adopt sector-specific reporting standards, with a first set of such standards to be adopted by June 2026. The CSRD allows listed SMEs to report using a separate and lighter , proportionate set of standards instead of the full set of ESRS.  At the request of the Commission, EFRAG has submitted a sustainability reporting standard for voluntary use by SMEs that are not in scope of the reporting requirements (VSME standard) . 13 The objective of the VSME standard is to provid e SMEs with a simple, widely recognised tool through which they can provide sustainability information to banks, large companies and other stakeholders that may demand such information.  Other important aspects of the CSRD are the provisions on assurance and on reporting value-chain information. Undertakings must publish their sustainability information together with the opinion of a statutory auditor or, if the Member States allows, an independent assurance service provider. The current requirement is for limited assurance and the CSRD provides that this could in the future become a requirement for reasonable assurance under certain conditions. 14 The CSRD also requires the Commission to adopt standards for sustainability assurance by means of delegated acts.  The CSRD requires undertakings to report value-chain information to the extent necessary for understanding their sustainability-related impacts, risks and opportunities. The CSRD establishes a so-called value-chain cap, which states that ESRS may not contain reporting requirements that would require undertakings to obtain from SMEs in their value chain information that exceeds the information to be disclosed under the proportionate standard for listed SMEs.  This proposal aims to reduce the reporting burden and to limit the trickle down of obligations on smaller companies. Firstly, the separate legislative proposal made by the Commission in parallel to this proposal would simplify the framework and reduce burden in the following ways:  – The number of undertakings subject to mandatory sustainability reporting requirements would be reduced by about 8 0 %, taking out of scope large undertakings with up to 1000 employees (i.e. some of the undertakings from the second wave and some of the undertakings from the first wave ) and listed SMEs (i.e. all undertakings in the third wave). The reporting requirements would only apply to large undertakings with more than 1000 employees on average (i.e. undertakings that have more than 1000 employees and either a turnover above EUR 50 million or a balance sheet above EUR 25 million). This revised threshold would align the CSRD more closely with the CSDDD. 15  – For undertakings not subject to mandatory sustainability reporting requirements , the Commission proposes a proportionate standard for voluntary use which would be based on the VSME standard developed by EFRAG. According to this proposal, the Commission would adopt this voluntary standard as a delegated act. In the meantime, to address market demand, the Commission intends to issue a recommendation on voluntary sustainability reporting as soon as possible, based on the VSME standard developed by EFRAG.  – The value-chain cap would be extended and strengthened. It would apply directly to the reporting company instead of being only a limit on what ESRS can specify. It would protect all undertakings with up to 1000 employees rather than just SMEs as is currently the case. And the limit would be defined by the voluntary standard adopted by the Commission as a delegated act , based on the VSME standard developed by EFRAG . This will substantially reduce the trickle-down effect.  – There would be no sector-specific reporting standards, so avoiding an increase in the number of prescribed datapoints that undertakings should report.  – The possibility of moving from a requirement for limited assurance to a requirement for reasonable assurance would be removed. This will provide clarity that there will be no future increase in costs of assurance for undertakings in scope.  – Instead of an obligation for the Commission to adopt standards for sustainability assurance by 2026, the Commission will issue targeted assurance guidelines by 2026 . This will allow the Commission to more quickly address emerging issues in the field of sustainability assurance that may be generating unnecessary burden on undertakings that are subject to the reporting requirements.  – The proposal introduces an “opt-in” regime where large undertakings with more than 1000 employees on average (i.e. undertakings that have more than 1000 employees and either a turnover above EUR 50 million or a balance sheet above EUR 25 million) and a net turnover not exceeding EUR 450 million which claim that their activities are aligned or partially aligned with the EU Taxonomy shall disclose their turnover and CapEx KPIs and may choose to disclose their OpEx KPI. This “opt-in” approach will eliminate entirely the cost of compliance with the Taxonomy reporting rules for large undertakings with more than 1000 employees on average (i.e. undertakings that have more than 1000 employees and either a turnover above EUR 50 million or a balance sheet above EUR 25 million) and a net turnover not exceeding EUR 450 million which do not claim that their activities are associated with economic activities that qualify as environmentally sustainable under the Taxonomy Regulation. In addition, this proposal provides more flexibility by allowing these undertakings to report on activities that meet certain Taxonomy technical screening criteria without meeting all of them. Such reporting on partial alignment can foster a gradual environmental transition of activities overtime, in line with the aim to scale up transition finance.  Secondly, the Commission intends to adopt without delay a delegated act to revise the first set of ESRS. To deliver swiftly on the simplification and streamlining of the ESRS, and to provide clarity and legal certainty to undertakings, the Commission aims to adopt the necessary delegated act as soon as possible, and at the latest six months after the entry into force of the Directive to simplify the reporting framework that is the subject of the separate legislative proposal referred to above. The revision of the delegated act will substantially reduce the number of mandatory ESRS datapoints by (i) removing those deemed least important for general purpose sustainability reporting, (ii) prioritising quantitative datapoints over narrative text and (iii) further distinguishing between mandatory and voluntary datapoints, without undermining interoperability with global reporting standards and without prejudice to the materiality assessment of each undertaking. The revision will clarify provisions that are deemed unclear. It will improve consistency with other pieces of EU legislation. It will provide clearer instructions on how to apply the materiality principle, to ensure that undertakings only report material information and to reduce the risk that assurance service providers inadvertently encourage undertakings to report information that is not necessary or dedicate excessive resources to the materiality assessment process. It will simplify the structure and presentation of the standards. It will further enhance the already very high degree of interoperability with global sustainability reporting standards. It will also make any other modifications that may be considered necessary considering the experience of the first application of ESRS.  Thirdly, this proposal would postpone by two years the entry into application of the reporting requirements for the second wave (large undertakings that are not public interest entities and that have more than 500 employees , as well as large undertakings with fewer than 500 employees 16 ) and the third wave (listed SMEs , small and non-complex credit institutions, and captive insurance and reinsurance undertakings ). The objective of the postponement is to avoid a situation in which certain undertakings are required to report for financial year 2025 (second wave) or 2026 (third wave) and are then subsequently relieved of this requirement. Such a situation would mean that the undertakings in question incur unnecessary and avoidable costs.  The Commission invites co-legislators to reach rapid agreement on the proposed postponement, in particular to provide the necessary legal clarity for undertakings in the second wave that are currently required to report for the first time in 2026 for financial year 2025.  Specific context and objectives of this proposal regarding the CSDDD  According to the current rules, Member States should transpose the CSDDD by 26 July 2026. Entry into application is envisaged in three phases: as from July 2027, the rules would start applying only to the largest EU companies, i.e. those that have more than 5000 employees and report a net annual (worldwide) turnover of more than 1.5 billion euro, as well as to non-EU companies that generate more than EUR 1.5 billion net turnover in the EU. In the second wave, EU companies with more than 3000 employees and more than EUR 900 million net turnover, as well as non-EU companies generating such net turnover in the EU would need to comply with the new framework as from July 2028. Last, in July 2029, all other companies falling under the general scope would have to start applying the (national rules transposing the) Directive. As from this date, the CSDDD is estimated to apply to approximately 6000 large EU companies, and some 900 non-EU companies. The personal scope and phased-in application take into account that companies of different size have different capacities to implement the new mandatory framework and, as such, is a key element in ensuring a proportional approach.  In addition, the separate legislative proposal made by the Commission in parallel with this proposal would simplify the framework and reduce companies’ burden in a number of ways. This proposal would postpone the first phase of the entry into application of the Directive by one year. The objective of the postponement is to provide additional time for the first group of companies to prepare for their obligations under the Directive, as amended, also taking into account the guidelines that the Commission will have adopted in accordance with the tighter timeline set out in the parallel simplification proposal.  Moreover, this proposal would postpone the transposition deadline for the Member States by one year to account for possible delays in their ongoing CSDDD transposition efforts due to possible amendments to the Directive by the parallel simplification proposal.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  Undertakings that are subject to the CSRD reporting requirements are also automatically required to report certain indicators under article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation. By postponing the application of the reporting requirements for companies in the second and third waves, this proposal would therefore also automatically postpone the date by when such companies must report those indicators under the Taxonomy Regulation.  The reporting requirements set out in the CSRD and ESRS aim to ensure, amongst other things, that financial market participants, credit institutions and benchmark administrators have access to the sustainability information that they need from undertakings to meet their own reporting obligations under the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation, the Capital Requirements Regulation and the Benchmarks Regulation. The proposed postponement will delay improvements to availability of information for financial market participants, credit institutions and benchmark administrators.  Undertakings subject to both the CSRD and the CSDDD are not required by the CSDDD to report any information additional to what they are required to report under the CSRD. Since this proposal postpones the measures foreseen in the CSDDD as well as the date of application of the reporting requirements for certain undertakings under the CSRD, meaning that the consistency between these two pieces of legislation is maintained.  • Consistency with other Union policies  This proposal is consistent with EU policy to enhance competitiveness, to simplify the regulatory framework and to reduce burden on business while still achieving the policy goals of the CSRD and CSDDD. This includes preserving the Green Deal as mid- to long-term competitiveness depends on companies sufficiently integrating sustainability considerations into their operations.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  The proposal’s legal basis rests on Articles 50 and 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Article 50 of the TFEU is the legal basis for adopting EU measures aimed at attaining the right of establishment in the single market in company law, and it mandates the European Parliament and the Council to act by means of Directives. Article 114 of the TFEU is a general legal basis with the objective of establishing or ensuring the functioning of the single market – in this case, the free movement of capital. Articles 50 and 114 of the TFEU are the legal basis for Directive (EU) 2022/2464 and Directive (EU) 2024/1760.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  This proposal modifies the dates of entry of application of certain provisions of EU law. These dates can only be modified through action at EU level.  • Proportionality  The policy objective is to delay the dates of entry of application of certain provisions of EU law. There only means of achieving that objective is to propose to modify those dates  • Choice of the instrument  This proposal is composed of a Directive that amends provisions of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and of the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD). An Omnibus Directive is considered to be the most appropriate legal instrument to amend existing Directives as regards simplification and burden reduction in the area of sustainability reporting and due diligence.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  The CSDDD has not yet been transposed or applied by companies. The CSRD has been applied by a first set of companies who are publishing their first sustainability statements mainly in the first half of 2025. It has therefore not been possible to undertake an ex-post evaluation or fitness check of either piece of legislation.  • Stakeholder consultations  The following consultation activities have helped to shape the content of this proposal.  - European Commission ‘Call for evidence on the rationalisation of reporting requirements’, from October to December 2023. 17  - European Commission ‘Reality Check on Sustainability Reporting and Roundtable on Simplification’ in early February 2025.  - The European Commission has also held separate stakeholder activities including two large hybrid stakeholder forums on the CSRD in May and November 2024 with the participation o f more than 400 people in person and more than 3000 people virtually.  - The European Commission received a very significant number of letters and detailed analyses from all types of stakeholders (from companies to investors, banks, civil society, Non-Governmental Organisations, chambers of commerce and Member States’ national administrations).  Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive  The European Commission’s Call for Evidence on the Rationalisation of Reporting Requirements sought evidence and views regarding regulations which are perceived to produce administrative burden. Almost 200 stakeholders responded, and primarily called for a simplification of sustainability reporting, due diligence and the EU Taxonomy.  In the European Commission’s meetings with European industry, social partners and civil society in early February 2025, stakeholders expressed support for the overarching objectives of the CSRD and CSDDD but highlighted a need for simplification and harmonisation in their implementation.  Some stakeholders, particularly business and industry groups, suggested pausing the application of existing legislation to focus on simplification. They argued that a postponement of the reporting requirements of the CSRD would give the Commission the opportunity to simplify the framework while allowing companies more time to prepare for any impending changes.  Other stakeholders, particularly civil society groups, saw strong merits in maintaining the rules and argued for the importance of legal certainty and regulatory stability for companies, as well as for maintaining the objectives of the European Green Deal and the Sustainable Finance Action Plan. They also highlighted that implementation guidelines should be used to clarify and simplify certain parts of the sustainability reporting framework, instead of a postponement or change to the existing rules.  The need for simplification has also been echoed by many other reports, recommendations, and stakeholder views from both financial and non-financial sector undertakings, many of which underscore the importance of reducing complexity and administrative burdens and which have informed the burden reduction measures described in this proposal.  Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive  Consultations with various stakeholders, including businesses, trade associations, and civil society organizations, as well as other contacts with and inputs received from stakeholders have informed the proposal. This includes, in particular, a two days-stakeholder event that allowed the Commission to hear from practitioners about which challenges they see with the current legislative framework and what could be possible solutions to address them. While some stakeholders called for far-reaching changes and postponements, others emphasized the need for regulatory certainty and opposed reopening the Directive, instead focusing on implementation. The proposal, together with the parallel proposal on simplification, aims to balance these perspectives by maintaining the integrity of the CSDDD while introducing changes to simplify and streamline the Directive.  • Collection and use of expertise  Not applicable.  • Impact assessment  This proposal is accompanied by a Commission Staff Working Document that includes an analysis of the impacts of the proposed measures. Given the urgent need to put forward proposals to address the identified problems, it has not been possible to prepare a full impact assessment.  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  This proposal is expressly designed to facilitate a major simplification of the sustainability reporting regime.  • Fundamental rights  Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive  The proposal respects the fundamental rights enshrined, and adheres to the principles stated, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive has an indirect positive impact on fundamental rights, given that sustainability reporting requirements can influence corporate behaviour for the better. It serves to make companies more aware of fundamental rights and positively influence how they identify and manage actual and potential adverse impacts on fundamental rights. The proposed postponement would also delay these positive impacts with regard to companies that would start applying the reporting requirements at a later date. However the reduction of burden on such companies, and especially the reduction of burden on companies that would be taken out of the CSRD scope by the separate proposal made by the Commission in parallel to this proposal, should lead to other societal gains in terms of wealth creation, employment and innovation, including innovation for sustainability.  Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive  The proposal respects the fundamental rights enshrined, and adheres to the principles stated, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. The CSDDD has protection and promotion of fundamental rights as one of its main objectives. It requires very large companies to identify and address adverse human rights and environmental impacts in their own operations, those of their subsidiaries and their chains of activities. The proposed postponement would delay these positive impacts with regard to the first group of companies in the scope of the Directive that would start applying the due diligence requirements at a later date.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  The proposal does not have any budgetary implications.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  Not applicable.  • Explanatory documents (for directives)  No explanatory documents are considered necessary.  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  Article 1 amends Article 5(2) of Directive (EU) 2022/2464 (Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive “CSRD”) by introducing a 2-year postponement of the sustainability reporting requirements for all companies in the CSRD scope that are required to comply from financial year 2025 or 2026 depending on their size.  In particular:  – Paragraph (1) point (a) require s Member States to ensure that the following undertakings report on sustainability from fi nanci al years starting on or after 1 January 2027 (instead of 1 January 2025):  · large undertakings with not more than 500 employees on average during the financial year ;  · large undertakings with more than 500 employees on average during the financial year but that are not public-interest entities ;  · parent undertakings of a large group with more than 500 employees on average on its balance sheet dates, on a consolidated basis, during the financial year;  · parent undertakings of a large group with more than 500 employees on average on its balance sheet dates, on a consolidated basis, during the financial year , but that are not public-interest entities;  – paragraph (1) point ( b ) requires Member States to ensure that SMEs with securities admitted to trading on an EU regulated market, small and non-complex institutions (provided they are large undertakings or listed SMEs) and EU captive (re)insurance undertakings (provided they are large undertakings or listed SMEs) report on sustainability from financial years starting on or after 1 January 202 8 (instead of 1 January 202 6 );  – paragraph (2) point ( a ) requires Member States to ensure that the following issuers report on sustainability from financial years starting on or after 1 January 2027 (instead of 1 January 2025) :  · issuers that are large undertakings with not more than 500 employees on average during the financial year ;  · issuers that are parent undertakings of a large group with not more than 500 employees on average, on a consolidated basis, during the financial year;  – paragraph (2) point ( b ) requires Member States to ensure that issuer s that are SMEs , small and non-complex institutions (provided they are large undertakings or listed SMEs) and EU captive (re)insurance undertakings (provided they are large undertakings or listed SMEs) report on sustainability from financial years starting on or after 1 January 2028 (instead of 1 January 2026) .  Article 2 amends Article 37 of Directive (EU) 2024/1760 (Corporate Due Diligence Directive ""CSDDD”) by postponing the transposition deadline as well as the application of the Directive by 1 year for the first group of companies in the scope of the Directive.  Article 3 requires Member States to transpose Article 1 of this Directive by 31 December 2025 at the latest, and to communicate to the Commission the text of their transposing measures.  Article 4 specifies that this Directive enters into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.  2025/0044 (COD)  Proposal for a  DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Directives (EU) 2022/2464 and (EU) 2024/1760 as regards the dates from which Member States are to apply certain corporate sustainability reporting and due diligence requirements  (Text with EEA relevance)  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 50 and 114 thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 18 ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) In its Communication of 11 February 2025 entitled ‘A simpler and faster Europe: Communication on implementation and simplification’ 19 , the Commission set out a vision for an implementation and simplification agenda that delivers fast and visible improvements for people and business on the ground. Th at requires more than an incremental approach and the U nion is to take bold action to achieve th at goal. The Commission, the European Parliament, the Council, Member States’ authorities at all levels and stakeholders need to work together to streamline and simplify U nion , national and regional rules and implement policies more effectively.  (2) In the context of the Commission’s commitment to reduce reporting burdens and enhance competitiveness, it is necessary to introduce targeted amendments to Directive s (EU) 2022/2464 20 and (EU) 2024/1760 21 of the European Parliament and of the Council , to achieve th o se objectives, whilst maintaining the policy objectives of the Green Deal 22 and the Sustainable Finance Action Plan 23 .  (3) Article 5(2) first subparagraph of Directive (EU) 2022/2464 specifies the date s from which Member States are to apply the sustainability reporting requirements set out in Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council 24 , with different dates depe n ding on the size of the undertaking concerned . Large undertakings that are public-interest entities with more than 500 employees on average during the financial year , and public-interest entities that are parent undertakings of a large group with more than 500 employees on average, on its balance sheet dates, on a consolidated basis, during the financial year , are to report in 2025 for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2024. The other large undertakings , and the other parent undertakings of a large group, are to report in 2026 for fina n cial years beginning on or after 1 January 2025 . Sm all and medium-sized undertakings - excluding micro-undertakings - , small and non-complex institutions and captive (re)insurance undertakings are to report in 2027 for fina n cial years beginning on or after 1 January 2026. Considering the ongoing Commission ’s initiatives aiming at simplify ing certain existing sustainability reporting obligation s and to reduce the undertakings’ related administrative burden, t o provide for legal clarity , and to avoid that the undertakings currently required to report for financial year s beginning on or after 1 January 2025 and on or after 1 January 2026 incur unnecessary and avoidable costs , the sustainability reporting requirements for th o se undertakings should be postponed by two years respectively .  (4) Article 5(2) , third subparagraph of Directive (EU) 2022/2464 specifies the dates from which Member States are to apply the sustainability reporting requirements set out in Directive 2004/109/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 25 , with different dates depe n ding on the size of the issuer concerned . Issuers that are l arge undertakings with more than 500 employees on average during the financial year , and issuers that are parent undertakings of a large group with more than 500 employees on average, on its balance sheet dates, on a consolidated basis, during the financial year, are to report in 2025 for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2024. The other issuers that are large undertakings , and the other issuers that are parent undertakings of a large group, are to report in 2026 for fina n cial years beginning on or after 1 January 2025. Issuers that are s mall and medium-sized undertakings - excluding micro-undertakings -, small and non-complex institutions and captive (re)insurance undertakings are to report in 2027 for fina n cial years beginning on or after 1 January 2026. Considering the ongoing Commission’s initiatives aiming at simplify ing certain existing sustainability reporting obligations and to reduce the undertakings’ related administrative burden, to provide for legal clarity , and to avoid that the issuers currently required to report for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2025 and on or after 1 January 2026 incur unnecessary and avoidable costs, the sustainability reporting requirements for th o se issuers should be postponed by two years respectively.  (5) The date by which Member States are to appl y Directive 2024/1760 should be postponed by one year for the first group of companies in the scope of th at Directive, to give companies more time to prepare for the requirements of that Directive and to provide them with the opportunity to take into account the guidelines to be issued by the Commission on how they should fulfil their due diligence obligations in a practical manner .  (6) Moreover, in light of the parallel legislative proposal aiming at simplify ing the sustainability framework and reduce burdens for companies, the deadline for the Member States t o transpos e Directive 2024/1760 should be extended by one year to account for possible delays in their ongoing transposition efforts due to possible amendments to th at Directive.  (7) Since the objectives of this Directive cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives.  (8) Directive s (EU) 2022/2464 and (EU) 2024/1760 should therefore be amended accordingly .  (9) For reasons of urgency and to provide legal certainty as soon as possible, this Directive should enter into force on the day following that of its publication,  HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:  Article 1  Amendments to Directive (EU) 2022/2464  In Directive (EU) 2022/2464, Article 5(2) is amended as follows:  (1) t he first subparagraph is amende d as follows:  (a) in point (b) , the introductory wording is replaced by the following:  ‘for financial years starting on or after 1 January 2027:’;  (b) in point (c), the introductory wording is replaced by the following:  ‘for financial years starting on or after 1 January 2028:’;  (2) t he third subparagraph is amended as follows:  (a) in point (b), the introductory wording is replaced by the following:  ‘for financial years starting on or after 1 January 2027:’;  (b) in point (c), the introductory wording is replaced by the following:  ‘for financial years starting on or after 1 January 2028:’.

Title of the proposal/initiative  Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directives (EU) 2022/2464 and (EU) 2024/1760 as regards certain corporate sustainability reporting and due diligence requirements for undertakings.  1.2. Policy area(s) concerned  Capital Markets Union, Savings and Investment Union, European Green Deal, Sustainable Finance Strategy, Company law and corporate governance  1.3. Objective(s)  1.3.1. General objective(s)  The general objectives pursued by this legislative proposal are to simplify and reduce certain elements of Directive 2006/43/EC, Directive 2013/34EU, Directive (EU) 2022/2464 and Directive (EU) 2024/1760 in order to alleviate the reporting burden on companies in scope of the requirements.  By reducing the administrative burden associated with reporting requirements and compliance costs of sustainability reporting stemming from the above legislation, this proposal intends to enhance the proportionality of the framework and the competitiveness of European companies, while also maintaining the objectives of the European Green Deal.  1.3.2. Specific objective(s)  The specific objectives of the proposed amendments to Directive (EU) 2022/2464 included in this proposal aim to achieve the following results:  – Postpone the sustainability reporting requirements on wave 2 and wave 3 companies by two years.  The specific objectives of the proposed amendments to Directive (EU) 2024/1760 included in this proposal aim to achieve the following results:  – Postpone the transposition deadline and the application of the sustainability due diligence requirements for wave 1 companies by one year.  1.3.3. Expected result(s) and impact  Specify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.  The expected results and impact of the proposed amendments are to simplify sustainability reporting requirements and as a result reduce the administrative burden on companies in this regard, whilst maintaining the objectives of the European Green Deal and the Sustainable Finance Action Plan. The proposed amendments are also expected to result in significant cost savings for companies in scope when carrying out sustainability reporting.  The amendments to Directive (EU) 2024/1760 included in this proposal are expected to ease the compliance burden of companies as they will have more time to prepare for compliance, adjust their policies, processes and procedures, also taking into account the guidelines which the Commission will issue, allowing them to build on best practices and reduce their reliance on legal counselling and advisory services.  1.3.4. Indicators of performance  Specify the indicators for monitoring progress and achievements.  The CSRD has been applied by a first set of companies who are publishing their first sustainability statements mainly in the first half of 2025. It has therefore not been possible to undertake an ex-post evaluation or fitness check of either piece of legislation.  To monitor progress towards achieving the proposal’s specific objectives, the Commission will explore the possibility of organising exchanges with stakeholders in different formats as well as periodic surveys of users of sustainability information and of undertakings that report such information, depending on the availability of financial resources. Article 6 of the CSRD requires the Commission to present a report on the implementation of the Directive by April 2029.  In this proposal, the Commission also commits to revising the first set of ESRS. Under Directive 2013/34/EU, the Commission is required to review those sustainability reporting standards, including the sustainability reporting standards for small and medium-sized undertakings, every three years to take account of relevant developments, including the development of international standards.  The implementation of the CSDDD as amended, and its effectiveness in reaching its objectives, in particular in addressing adverse impacts, will also be subject to regular evaluation according to Article 36 of that Directive.  A number of indicators will be used to monitor the progress of these proposals, such as the effectiveness and timeliness of the actions proposed, the efficiency of processes for collecting and processing data in accordance with the sustainability reporting requirements, and the objective to limit administrative burden and avoid unnecessary or duplicative reporting requirements.  1.4. The proposal/initiative relates to:  ¨ a new action  ¨ a new action following a pilot project / preparatory action 26  ¨ the extension of an existing action  þ a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action  1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative  1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative  With this proposal, the Commission proposes a Directive amending Directives (EU) 2022/2464 and (EU) 2024/1760. Once the co-legislators will have reached an agreement on the contents of the proposal, Member States will have a certain period of time to transpose the amendments introduced by this Directive with respect to postponing the date as from which certain groups of companies have to apply with these Directives into their national law. Under this proposal, this transposition deadline is set at 31 December 2025. This proposal also seeks to delay the transposition deadline of the Directive (EU) 2024/1760 by one year. As a result, Member States would be required to transpose the CSDDD by 26 July 2027 at the latest.  In a separate legislative proposal, the Commission proposes to amend a number of provisions of Directives 2006/43/EC, 2013/34/EU, (EU) 2022/2464 and (EU) 2024/1760. The Commission also proposes to revise Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2772 (European Sustainability Reporting Standards). The Commission will adopt the revised ESRS delegated act in time for those undertakings in the second wave that would be required to start reporting under the CSRD in 2028 for financial year 2027 to apply the revised standards.  To monitor progress towards achieving the proposal’s specific objectives, the Commission will explore the possibility of organising exchanges with stakeholders in different formats as well as periodic surveys of users of sustainability information and of undertakings that report such information, depending on the availability of financial resources. Article 6 of the CSRD requires the Commission to present a report on the implementation if the Directive by April 2029. The implementation of the CSDDD as amended, and its effectiveness in reaching its objectives, in particular in addressing adverse impacts, will also be subject to regular evaluation according to Article 36 of that Directive. This proposal does not require an implementation plan.  1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, greater effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this section 'added value of EU involvement' is the value resulting from EU action, that is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.  The Accounting Directive, as amended by the CSRD, already regulates the disclosure of sustainability information in the EU. Common rules on sustainability reporting and its assurance ensure a level playing field for companies established in the different Member States. Significant differences in requirements for sustainability reporting and assurance between Member States would create additional costs and complexity for companies operating across borders, which would be detrimental to the single market. Member States acting alone are not able to modify existing EU laws to reduce the burden on companies.  Similarly, the CSDDD already sets out a harmonised regulatory framework for corporate sustainability due diligence, and also covers certain third-country companies active in the EU market, ensuring level playing field in this policy area.  1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past  N/A  1.5.4. Compatibility with the multiannual financial framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments  N/A  1.5.5. Assessment of the different available financing options, including scope for redeployment  N/A  3. ESTIMATED FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE  3.1. Heading(s) of the multiannual financial framework and expenditure budget line(s) affected  N/A  4. Digital dimensions  4.1. Requirements of digital relevance  Table: Row 1 — The reporting requirements introduced by Directive 2013/34/EU require companies to collect and report data concerning their impacts, risks and opportunities as regards material sustainability matters. This exercise entails significant data identification, collection, processing, verification and publication. In order to collect the relevant data, undertakings often use digital data collection and data sharing platforms. Additionally, in order to store and process the data for the purposes of sustainability reporting companies also often utilise digital data management tools. Users of sustainability information increasingly expect such information to be accessible, comparable and machine-readable in digital formats. Member States must require that undertakings subject to the sustainability reporting requirements of Directive 2013/34/EU make their management reports available on their websites, free of charge to the public. Digitalisation creates opportunities to exploit information more efficiently and holds the potential for significant cost savings for both users and undertakings. Digitalisation also enables the centralisation at Union and Member State level of data in an open and accessible format that facilitates reading and allows for the comparison of data. These requirements also complement the creation of a European single access point (ESAP) for public corporate information. As regards specific requirements within the Directive which are of digital relevance, please see below. Directive 2013/34/EU requires undertakings subject to sustainability reporting to prepare their management report in the electronic reporting format specified in Article 3 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 (ESEF Delegated Regulation). It also requires these undertakings to mark up their sustainability reporting, including the disclosures required by Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852, in accordance with the digital taxonomy to be adopted by the Commission by way of an amendment to  the ESEF Delegated Regulation. A digital taxonomy for the Union sustainability reporting standards will allow sustainability reporting to be tagged and to be machine-readable. Until the adoption of this digital taxonomy, undertakings are not required to mark-up their sustainability statements. Considering that the sustainability statement will become machine-readable only once it is both included in an XHTML document and marked-up with a digital taxonomy, pending the adoption of the digital taxonomy undertakings are also not required to prepare the management report in XHTML. Stakeholders affected by these requirements include undertakings required to prepare and publish a sustainability statement which has been digitally tagged and provided in an XHTML format, as well as assurance providers who must verify that the sustainability statement meets the necessary requirements. The current proposal does not modify the existing digital tagging or format rules introduced by the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, which will enhance digital reporting and enable the use of artificial intelligence in utilising the information that undertakings report. As regards the CSDDD, digital tools and technologies could support and reduce the cost of data gathering and assessment. This proposal does not amend the relevant provisions of the CSDDD.  4.2. Data  Table: Row 1 — See section above.  4.3. Digital solutions  Table: Row 1 — See section above.  4.4. Interoperability assessment  Table: Row 1 — N/A  4.5. Measures to support digital implementation  Table: Row 1 — To facilitate the smooth implementation of the requirements of digital relevance identified in Section 4.1., the Commission is involved in a number of initiatives. Firstly, a digital taxonomy for the Union sustainability reporting standards will be necessary to allow the reported information to be tagged in accordance with those sustainability reporting standards. The Commission will adopt a digital taxonomy for the tagging of sustainability information via a Delegated Act, after having received technical advice from ESMA. Secondly, in the framework of the 2025 Technical Support Instrument round, the Commission intends to launch a flagship multi-country project entitled ""Improving Sustainability Reporting for Businesses."" This initiative aims to enhance the capacity of Member States to support companies, particularly SMEs, in implementing CSRD and EU Taxonomy reporting requirements. The support under this initiative will take into account the evolution of the reporting requirements, and it will also be relevant for non-listed SMEs that are not subject to mandatory reporting but face growing demands for sustainability information from their financial and value chain partners. Thirdly, EFRAG has launched an SME forum in which they bring together relevant stakeholders of the SME community to discuss the implementation of the sustainability reporting requirements and how digital solutions and tools can be used to facilitate sustainability reporting for SMEs. As regards the CSDDD, in order to help companies fulfil their due diligence obligations along their value chain, the Directive encourages the use of digital tools and technologies and requires the Commission to issue guidelines with useful information and references to appropriate resources. This proposal does not amend the relevant provisions.",['https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-10-2025-0064_EN.html'],"European Parliament legislative resolution of 3 April 2025 on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directives (EU) 2022/2464 and (EU) 2024/1760 as regards the dates from which Member States are to apply certain corporate sustainability reporting and due diligence requirements ( COM(2025)0080 – C10-0038/2025 – 2025/0044(COD) )

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 50 and 114 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee(1),
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure(2),
Whereas:
(1) In its communication of 11 February 2025 entitled ‘A simpler and faster Europe: Communication on implementation and simplification’, the Commission set out a vision for an implementation and simplification agenda that delivers fast and visible improvements for people and business on the ground. That requires more than an incremental approach and the Union is to take bold action to achieve that goal. The European Parliament, the Council, the Commission, the authorities of the Member States at all levels and stakeholders need to work together to streamline and simplify Union, national and regional rules and to implement policies more effectively.
(2) In the context of the Commission’s commitment to reducing reporting burdens and to enhancing competitiveness, it is necessary to introduce targeted amendments to Directives (EU) 2022/2464(3)and (EU) 2024/1760(4)of the European Parliament and of the Council in order to achieve those objectives, whilst maintaining the policy objectives of the Green Deal as set out in the Commission’s communication of 11 December 2019 entitled ‘The European Green Deal’ and the Sustainable Finance Action Plan as set out in the Commission’s communication of 8 March 2018 entitled ‘Action Plan: Financing Sustainable Growth’.
(3) Directive (EU) 2022/2464 specifies the dates from which Member States are to apply the sustainability reporting requirements set out in Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council(5), with different dates depending on the size of the undertaking concerned. Large undertakings that are public-interest entities with more than 500 employees on average during the financial year and public-interest entities that are parent undertakings of a large group with more than 500 employees on average on its balance sheet dates, on a consolidated basis, during the financial year are to report in 2025 for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2024. Other large undertakings and other parent undertakings of a large group are to report in 2026 for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2025. Small and medium-sized undertakings, except micro-undertakings, small and non-complex institutions, captive insurance undertakings and captive reinsurance undertakings are to report in 2027 for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2026. Considering the ongoing Commission initiatives which aim to simplify certain existing sustainability reporting obligations and to reduce the related administrative burden on undertakings, and in order to provide for legal clarity and to avoid the undertakings currently required to report for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2025 and on or after 1 January 2026 incurring unnecessary and avoidable costs, the sustainability reporting requirements for those undertakings should be postponed by two years.
(4) Directive (EU) 2022/2464 specifies the dates from which Member States are to apply the sustainability reporting requirements set out in Directive 2004/109/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(6), with different dates depending on the size of the issuer concerned. Issuers that are large undertakings with more than 500 employees on average during the financial year and issuers that are parent undertakings of a large group with more than 500 employees on average on its balance sheet dates, on a consolidated basis, during the financial year are to report in 2025 for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2024. Other issuers that are large undertakings and other issuers that are parent undertakings of a large group are to report in 2026 for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2025. Issuers that are small and medium-sized undertakings, except micro-undertakings, small and non-complex institutions, captive insurance undertakings and captive reinsurance undertakings are to report in 2027 for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2026. Considering the ongoing Commission initiatives which aim to simplify certain existing sustainability reporting obligations and to reduce the related administrative burden on undertakings, and in order to provide for legal clarity and to avoid the issuers currently required to report for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2025 and on or after 1 January 2026 incurring unnecessary and avoidable costs, the sustainability reporting requirements for those issuers should be postponed by two years.
(5) The date from which Member States are to apply Directive (EU) 2024/1760 should be postponed by one year for the first set of companies that fall within the scope of that Directive in order to give companies more time to prepare for the requirements of that Directive and to provide them with the opportunity to take into account the guidelines to be issued by the Commission on how they should fulfil their due diligence obligations in a practical manner. Furthermore, the application date of 1 January 2029 for the measures necessary to comply with the reporting obligation pursuant to Article 16 of Directive (EU) 2024/1760 regarding the third set of companies that fall within the scope of that Directive should be amended in order to ensure coherence with the respective application dates for the other sets of companies.
(6) Moreover, in the light of a parallel legislative proposal which aims to simplify the sustainability framework and reduce the burden on companies, the deadline for the Member States to transpose Directive (EU) 2024/1760 should be extended by one year in order to take into account possible delays in their ongoing transposition efforts due to possible amendments to that Directive.
(7) Since the objectives of this Directive cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
(8) Directives (EU) 2022/2464 and (EU) 2024/1760 should therefore be amended accordingly. Since the amendment to Directive (EU) 2024/1760 alters the transposition deadline and certain dates of application, all of which fall in the future, Member States would only need to postpone the application dates pursuant to Article 2 of this Directive in the event that they have already transposed Directive (EU) 2024/1760.
(9) In view of the urgency of the matter and to provide legal certainty as soon as possible, it is considered to be appropriate to invoke the exception to the eight-week period provided for in Article 4 of Protocol No 1 on the role of national Parliaments in the European Union, annexed to the Treaty on European Union, to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community.
(10) For reasons of urgency and to provide legal certainty as soon as possible, this Directive should enter into force on the day following that of its publication in theOfficial Journal of the European Union,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:

Article 5

This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
Done at Brussels, 14 April 2025.",https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202500794,"The European Commission has proposed a directive to amend existing legislation on corporate sustainability reporting and due diligence, focusing on adjusting the application dates for these regulations. This initiative aims to simplify regulatory frameworks and reduce administrative burdens, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The proposal is part of a broader effort to enhance competitiveness amid economic and geopolitical challenges, such as rising energy prices and trade tensions.

Central to this proposal are the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD). The CSRD, effective since January 2023, requires companies to disclose their sustainability impacts, aiding investors and stakeholders in understanding risks related to climate change and other sustainability issues. The CSDDD, adopted in June 2024, mandates companies to address adverse human rights and environmental impacts within their operations and supply chains.

To help EU companies maintain competitiveness and adapt to the global landscape, the proposal seeks to delay the implementation of certain CSRD and CSDDD provisions. This phased implementation requires large public interest entities to start reporting in 2025, with other companies following in subsequent years. Additionally, the proposal involves developing European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) to guide these requirements.

The directive aims to postpone the application date for the first group of companies under the CSDDD by one year, allowing more time for preparation and the opportunity to consider guidelines on fulfilling due diligence obligations. Furthermore, the deadline for member states to transpose the CSDDD is extended by one year.

1.4.2025  COM(2025) 136 final  2025/0070(COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulation (EU) 2019/631 to include an additional flexibility as regards the calculation of manufacturers’ compliance with CO2 emission performance standards for new passenger cars and new light commercial vehicles for the calendar years 2025 to 2027  (Text with EEA relevance)  EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM  1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  Regulation (EU) 2019/631 1 sets CO 2 emission performance standards for new passenger cars and light commercial vehicles . It is a key contribut ion to achieve the objective s set in the EU climate law, including the 2050 climate neutrality and the 2030 target to reduce economy-wide CO 2 emissions by 55% compared to 1990.  The automotive industry is of key importance for the EU economy and accounts for over 7% of the EU's GDP. It provides jobs - directly or indirectly, in manufacturing, sales, maintenance, construction and transport and transport services - to around 13 million Europeans. The automotive sector is undergoing a structural transformation including changes in clean and digital technologies, in particular the shift towards zero-emission vehicles. The CO 2 standards provide long-term certainty and predictability for investors along the value chain, therefore enabling such sectoral transformation, while allowing sufficient lead time for a fair transition.  The regulation requires that the annual EU fleet-wide average CO 2 emissions from new cars and new vans are reduced in five-year intervals. In 2025, a target of 15% reduction of CO 2 compared to 2021 values starts applying in each year for the 2025–2029 period.  Each year, the average CO 2 emissions and the specific CO 2 emissions target for each manufacturer are established, based on the EU fleet-wide target, in order to evaluate the manufacturers’ performance in complying with their targets. Manufacturers exceeding their specific emissions target pay an excess emission premium of €95 per g/km for each new vehicle registered.  I n the context of the Strategic Dialogue on the Future of the Automotive Industry that took place in Q1 2025 and as announced in the Commission Automotive Action Plan of 5 March 2025, the proposal concerns a targeted change of the Regulation (EU) 2019/631 to provide manufacturers with an additional flexibility as regards their compliance obligations , by provid ing for a three-year compliance period for 2025, 2026 and 2027 , instead of an annual period .  The targeted amendment introduces such additional flexibility for manufacturers while maintaining the level of ambition of the emissions reduction target.  To maintain regulatory certainty and predictability, it is essential that this one-off flexibility to allow compliance over a three-year compliance period is agreed between the European Parliament and Council swiftly and without delay.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  This proposal does not amend the substantive rules of Regulation (EU) 2019/631 and it maintains the targets. The proposal responds to concerns expressed in the EU by the automotive sector, by providing an additional flexibility for manufacturers to comply with the objectives of the Regulation.  • Consistency with other Union policies  The European Climate Law Regulation 2 establishes the framework for achieving climate neutrality within the EU by 2050. The regulation requires the reduction of net EU greenhouse-gas emissions by at least 55% (compared to 1990 levels) by 2030. It requires the Commission to propose a 2040 target. In line with the EU Climate Law reduction targets, Regulation (EU) 2019/631 sets emission reduction target s for cars and vans.  The current proposal does not change the reduction targets and does not lower the overall CO 2 emission standards ambitions. By introducing a one-off three-year compliance period for 2025, 2026 and 2027 instead of annual assessment, it allows an additional flexibility for vehicles manufacturers, while keeping the certainty and predictability for investors along the value chain.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  The legal basis for this proposal is Article 192 of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). In accordance with Article 191 and 192(1) TFEU, the European Union shall contribute to the pursuit, inter alia, of the following objectives: preserving, protecting and improving the quality of the environment; promoting measures at international level to deal with regional or worldwide environmental problems, and in particular combating climate change. Based on Article 192 of the TFEU, the Union has already adopted policies to address CO 2 emissions from cars and light commercial vehicles beginning with Regulation (EC) 443/2009 3 and Regulation (EU) 510/2011 4 .  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  This initiative is consistent with the principle of subsidiarity. Amendment of Regulation (EU) 2019/631 to provide this additional flexibility cannot be achieved by the Member States themselves.  • Proportionality  The proposal is consistent with the principle of proportionality, because it does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the Union’s objectives of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in a cost-effective manner, while providing vehicles manufacturers with a one-off additional flexibility for their compliance while maintaining the level of ambition of the targets.  • Choice of the instrument  The proposal amends Regulation (EU) 2019/631 only as regards providing an additional flexibility on the compliance periods. Thus, it should follow the same form of act, i.e. a regulation.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  No evaluation is necessary for the proposal, since it only provides for a new and temporary flexibility for vehicles manufacturers to comply with the targets.  • Stakeholder consultations  The Commission held intense and extensive discussions with manufacturers and stakeholders from the automotive value chain in the context of the Strategic Dialogue on the Future of the Automotive Industry that took place in Q1 2025.  • Collection and use of expertise  The proposal has been elaborated following a process of internal scrutiny of existing obligations and is based on experience in implementing the related legislation, including the annual monitoring process of manufacturers’ CO 2 compliance.  • Impact assessment  The proposal concerns targeted changes of Regulation (EU) 2019/631 to provide manufacturers with an additional flexibility as regards their compliance obligations. It does not change the level of ambition of the targets.  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  Compared to the current Regulation, the proposal is not expected to increase administrative costs. In addition, it is not increasing the complexity of the legal framework.  • Fundamental rights  The proposal respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union 5 . In particular, it contributes to the objective of a high level of environmental protection in accordance with the principle of sustainable development as laid down in Article 37 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  The legislative financial statement setting out the implications for budgetary, human and administrative resources was attached to the proposal which led to the adoption of Regulation (EU) 2019/631 and its latest revision by Regulation (EU) 2023/851.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  This proposal does not change the substance of the rules, the implementation assessment remains the same as of the proposal which led to the adoption of Regulation (EU) 2019/631, as amended by Regulation (EU) 2023/851.  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  Article 1(1) amends Article 4 in order to specify the three-year compliance period.  Article 1(2) amends Article 6 to specify that the pooling agreements for 2025-2027 should be communicated to the Commission by end of 2027.  Article 1(3) amends Article 8 to specify the rules on imposing the excess emissions premiums for the three-year compliance period 2025-2027.  2025/0070 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulation (EU) 2019/631 to include an additional flexibility as regards the calculation of manufacturers’ compliance with CO 2 emission performance standards for new passenger cars and new light commercial vehicles for the calendar years 2025 to 2027  (Text with EEA relevance)  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192(1) thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 6 ,  Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions 7 ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) Regulation (EU) 2019/631 of the European Parliament and of the Council 8 sets out the CO 2 targets for new passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, that form a key part of the U nion framework to reduc e by 2030 net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 % below 1990 levels and reach economy-wide climate-neutrality by 2050.  (2) In response to the request of stakeholders for an additional compliance flexibility on CO 2 targets as regards the period 2025 to 2027 , i t is appropriate to urgently adopt an amend ment to allow a one-off flexibility for those three years in the calculation of the compliance with the CO 2 emission performance standards , while maintain ing the targets for reducing CO 2 emissions .  (3) During the period 2025 to 2027, manufacturers should ensure that the average specific emissions of CO 2 of their vehicles do not exceed an emissions target, calculated as the average of their annual specific emissions targets over the period. Compliance with the targets should be assessed at the end of the three-year period for each individual manufacturer. The excess emission premiums should be calculated accordingly.  (4) In order t o align the pooling provisions with the additional compliance flexibility in the years 2025 to 2027 , it should be possible to enter into pooling agreements for each of th os e three years until the end of 2027 .  (5) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely to provide additional flexibility for the CO 2 compliance in the period 2025 to 2027 while preserving the CO 2 emissions reduction requirements for both new passenger cars and new light commercial vehicles , cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but can rather, by reason of t heir scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.  (6) Regulation (EU) 2019/631 should therefore be amended accordingly,  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Article 1  Regulation (EU) 2019/631 is amended as follows:  (1) in Article 4 , the following paragraph is added:  ‘1a. By way of derogation from paragraph 1, for the three-year period comprising the calendar years 2025 to 2027, a manufacturer, including when it is a member of a pool, shall ensure that its average specific emissions of CO 2 over that period do not exceed its specific emissions target over that period.  Those average specific emissions of CO 2 shall be calculated as the average over the three-year period of the annual average specific emissions of CO 2 weighted according to the number of newly registered vehicles for the manufacturer in each calendar year.  The specific emissions target shall be calculated as the average over the three-year period of the annual specific emissions targets determined in accordance with point 6.3 of Part A or Part B of Annex I or, where a manufacturer is granted a derogation under Article 10, in accordance with that derogation, weighted according to the number of newly registered vehicles for the manufacturer in each calendar year.  For each calendar year when a manufacturer was included in a pool, the annual average specific emissions of CO 2 and the annual specific emissions target to be used for those calculations shall be the values for that pool.’;  (2) in Article 6 , in paragraph 2, the following subparagraph is added :  ‘By way of derogation from the first subparagraph, an agreement to form a pool covering the calendar years 2025 or 2026 may be entered into up to 31 December 2027.’;  (3) in Article 8 , in paragraph 1, the following sub paragraph is added :  ‘By way of derogation from the first subparagraph, with respect to the calendar years 2025 to 2027, the Commission shall impose an excess emissions premium on any manufacturer whose average specific emissions of CO 2 over those three years exceed its specific emissions target over the period 2025 to 2027.’.  Article 2  This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union .  This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.

FRAMEWORK OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE  1.1. Title of the proposal/initiative  Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) 2019/631 to include an additional flexibility as regards the calculation of manufacturers’ compliance with CO2 emission performance standards for new passenger cars and new light commercial vehicles for the calendar years 2025 to 2027.  1.2. Policy area(s) concerned  Climate policy  1.3. Objective(s)  1.3.1. General objective(s)  The CO 2 standards provide long-term certainty and predictability for investors along the automotive value chain, while allowing sufficient lead time for a fair transition. The amending proposal aims at providing additional flexibility for manufacturers to comply with the 2025 CO 2 target, while leaving the level of ambition unchanged.  1.3.2. Specific objective(s)  The proposal concerns targeted changes of the CO 2 cars and vans Regulation to provide manufacturers with an additional flexibility: it provides for a three-year instead of an annual compliance period, for 2025, 2026 and 2027 combined.  1.3.3. Expected result(s) and impact  Specify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.  The amendment, if adopted, would determine that compliance is assessed over the years of 2025, 2026 and 2027 combined to allow car manufacturers to compensate an exceedance of the target in one or two of these years by overachievements in the other year(s).  1.3.4. Indicators of performance  Specify the indicators for monitoring progress and achievements.  Monitor the CO 2 compliance of manufacturers over the three years period.  1.4. The proposal/initiative relates to:   a new action   a new action following a pilot project / preparatory action 9   the extension of an existing action   a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action  1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative  1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative  The amending proposal aims at providing additional flexibility for manufacturers to comply with the CO 2 targets, while maintaining overall ambition on the CO 2 reduction targets over the period 2025-2029.  1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, greater effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this section 'added value of EU involvement' is the value resulting from EU action, that is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.  Climate change is a trans-boundary problem, which cannot be solved by national or local action alone. Coordination of climate action must be taken at European level  and EU action is justified on grounds of subsidiarity. Given the need to modify Regulation (EU) 2019/631 by providing an additional flexibility as regards the compliance periods, the objectives of this initiative cannot be achieved by the Member States themselves.  1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past  The proposal builds on existing legislation which has ensured continuous reductions in the CO 2 emissions of the EU fleet of new cars and light commercial vehicles over the past decade.  1.5.4. Compatibility with the multiannual financial framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments  No additional resources required.  1.5.5. Assessment of the different available financing options, including scope for redeployment  No additional resources required.  1.6. Duration of the proposal/initiative and of its financial impact   limited duration  –  in effect from [DD/MM]YYYY to [DD/MM]YYYY  –  financial impact from YYYY to YYYY for commitment appropriations and from YYYY to YYYY for payment appropriations.   unlimited duration  – Implementation with a start-up period from YYYY to YYYY,  – followed by full-scale operation.  1.7. Method(s) of budget implementation planned 10   Direct management by the Commission  –  by its departments, including by its staff in the Union delegations;  –  by the executive agencies   Shared management with the Member States   Indirect management by entrusting budget implementation tasks to:  –  third countries or the bodies they have designated  –  international organisations and their agencies (to be specified)  –  the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund  –  bodies referred to in Articles 70 and 71 of the Financial Regulation  –  public law bodies  –  bodies governed by private law with a public service mission to the extent that they are provided with adequate financial guarantees  –  bodies governed by the private law of a Member State that are entrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership and that are provided with adequate financial guarantees  –  bodies or persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in the common foreign and security policy pursuant to Title V of the Treaty on European Union, and identified in the relevant basic act  –   bodies established in a Member State, governed by the private law of a Member State or Union law and eligible to be entrusted, in accordance with sector-specific rules, with the implementation of Union funds or budgetary guarantees, to the extent that such bodies are controlled by public law bodies or by bodies governed by private law with a public service mission, and are provided with adequate financial guarantees in the form of joint and several liability by the controlling bodies or equivalent financial guarantees and which may be, for each action, limited to the maximum amount of the Union support.  Comments  No additional resources required.  2. MANAGEMENT MEASURES  2.1. Monitoring and reporting rules  No change to the monitoring and reporting rules is introduced, since the current system also allows to monitor the application of the proposed additional fexibility.  2.2. Management and control system(s)  2.2.1. Justification of the budget implementation method(s), the funding implementation mechanism(s), the payment modalities and the control strategy proposed  The proposal is not implementing a financial programme but introducing an additional flexibility for 2025-2027 in terms of compliance by the light-duty vehicles manufacturers with CO 2 emissions targets. Management mode, funding implementation mechanisms, payment modalities and control strategy in relation to error rates are not applicable.  2.2.2. Information concerning the risks identified and the internal control system(s) set up to mitigate them  This proposal does not concern a spending programme. Efficient monitoring of vehicle registration data is essential for ensuring legal certainty in enforcing the legislation and for ensuring level playing field between different manufacturers.  2.2.3. Estimation and justification of the cost-effectiveness of the controls (ratio between the control costs  and the value of the related funds managed), and assessment of the expected levels of risk of error (at payment & at closure)  This initiative does not bring about new significant controls/risks that would not be covered be an existing internal control framework. No specific measures beyond the application of the Financial Regulation have been envisaged.  2.3. Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities  In addition to the application of the Financial Regulation to prevent fraud and irregularities, the additional flexibility for compliance with the CO 2 reduction requirements provided for in this proposal will be accompanied by monitoring and reporting of different datasets as provided for in Regulation (EU) 2019/631.  3. ESTIMATED FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE  3.1. Heading(s) of the multiannual financial framework and expenditure budget line(s) affected  No additional resources required.

(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192(1) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee(1),
After consulting the Committee of the Regions,
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure(2),
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EU) 2019/631 of the European Parliament and of the Council(3)sets the CO2emission performance standards for new passenger cars and new light commercial vehicles that form a key part of the Union framework to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 % compared to 1990 levels by 2030 and to achieve economy-wide climate-neutrality by 2050.
(2) In response to a request from stakeholders for additional compliance flexibility on CO2targets as regards the period 2025 to 2027, it is appropriate to urgently adopt an amendment that provides for a one-off flexibility for those three years in respect of calculating compliance with CO2emission performance standards, while maintaining the targets for reducing CO2emissions.
(3) During the period 2025 to 2027, manufacturers should ensure that the average specific emissions of CO2of their vehicles do not exceed an emissions target, calculated as the average of their annual specific emissions targets over that period. Compliance with those targets should be assessed at the end of the three-year period for each individual manufacturer. The excess emission premiums should be calculated accordingly.
(4) In order to align the pooling provisions with the additional compliance flexibility in the years 2025 to 2027, it should be possible to enter into pooling agreements for the calendar year 2025 or 2026 until the end of 2027.
(5) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely to provide additional flexibility for the CO2compliance in the period 2025 to 2027 while preserving the CO2emissions reduction requirements for both new passenger cars and new light commercial vehicles, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but can rather, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.
(6) In view of the urgency to provide an additional flexibility for the CO2compliance in the period 2025 to 2027 while preserving the CO2emissions reduction requirements for both new passenger cars and new light commercial vehicles, it is considered to be appropriate to invoke the exception to the eight-week period provided for in Article 4 of Protocol No 1 on the role of national Parliaments in the European Union, annexed to the Treaty on European Union, to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community.
(7) Regulation (EU) 2019/631 should therefore be amended accordingly,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

Article 1

Regulation (EU) 2019/631 is amended as follows:
(1) in Article 4, the following paragraph is inserted:‘1a.   By way of derogation from paragraph 1, for the three-year period comprising the calendar years 2025 to 2027, a manufacturer, including when it is a member of a pool, shall ensure that its average specific emissions of CO2over that period do not exceed its specific emissions target over that period.Those average specific emissions of CO2shall be calculated as the average over the three-year period of the annual average specific emissions of CO2weighted according to the number of newly registered vehicles for the manufacturer in each calendar year.The specific emissions target shall be calculated as the average over the three-year period of the annual specific emissions targets determined in accordance with point 6.3 of Part A or Part B of Annex I or, where a manufacturer is granted a derogation under Article 10, in accordance with that derogation, weighted according to the number of newly registered vehicles for the manufacturer in each calendar year.For each calendar year in which a manufacturer was included in a pool, the annual average specific emissions of CO2and the annual specific emissions target to be used for those calculations shall be the values for that pool.’;
(2) in Article 6(2), the following subparagraph is added:‘By way of derogation from the first subparagraph, an agreement to form a pool covering the calendar year 2025 or 2026 may be entered into up to 31 December 2027.’;
(3) in Article 8(1), the following subparagraph is added:‘By way of derogation from the first subparagraph, with respect to the calendar years 2025 to 2027, the Commission shall impose an excess emissions premium on any manufacturer whose average specific emissions of CO2over those three years exceed its specific emissions target over the period 2025 to 2027.’.

Article 2

This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in theOfficial Journal of the European Union.
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.
