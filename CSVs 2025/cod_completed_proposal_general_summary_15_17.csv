PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 as regards a shorter settlement cycle in the Union  (Text with EEA relevance)  {SWD(2025) 37 final}  EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM  1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  The EU needs to do more to unlock the financing necessary to finance the digital, green and social transition as well as to boost growth. Efficiently functioning and deep capital markets are a necessary condition for achieving that goal. However, EU capital markets remain fragmented despite substantial efforts to integrate them over the years; this fragmentation is a substantial impediment to their development. This has been confirmed by a number of reports during 2024 including the Draghi report 1 , and the Letta report 2 . These reports also underline that the competitiveness and attractiveness of EU capital markets, and their ability to deliver the financing that the EU needs, can only be achieved if those markets embrace innovation.  The Savings and Investments Union needs to be built on efficient and safe post-trade services. These services play a key role, amongst other things, in the issuance of securities, finalisation of trades (settlement), keeping track of the ownership of securities as well as managing and reducing risks (clearing). Post-trade services are essential for the functioning of EU capital markets. For these reasons, all aforementioned reports have emphasised that more needs to be done to improve the efficiency of post-trade services.  Each day, more than EUR 4 trillion of securities 3 are settled in EU central securities depositorie s (CSDs) . The longer settlement takes ( i ) the longer the r isks 4 faced by buyers and sellers last ; (ii) the longer investors have to wait to receive the money or the securities they are owed – if the settlement doesn’t fail ; and (iii) the more that opportunities to enter in other transactions are reduced . Fast, efficient and reliable settlement is therefore an essential pre-condition for developing the Savings and Investments Union .  It has now been ten years since the Central Securities Depositories Regulation (CSDR) 5 entered into force and harmonised the securities settlement cycle in the EU at a maximum of two business days after the trade date (so-called ‘T+2’) for certain secondary markets transactions. 6 Since then, financial markets and technology have continued to evolve. Following the EU move at the end of 2014, many jurisdictions followed and moved to shorter settlement; for example, the US moved to T+2 in 2017. But innovation and the need to improve the efficiency of settlement, to increase competitiveness as well as to reduce risks to financial stability, have meant that efforts have not stopped there. The rest of the world has moved on since then: for instance China, India, the United States and Canada, have all shortened settlement to a maximum of one business day after the trade date (so-called ‘T+1’) . Significantly, the global shift to T+1 is creating misalignments between EU and global financial markets and creates potential competitiveness gaps for EU capital markets. These misalignments will only increase the more countries will move to T+1.  The most recent review of the CSDR recognised these trends and mandated the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), in close cooperation with the members of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB), to assess the appropriateness of shortening the settlement cycle in the EU and present a roadmap for how such a move could be carried out. ESMA published its report (ESMA Report) on 18 November 2024 7 , recommending that the EU move to T+1 no later than 11 October 2027. 8  Shortening the settlement cycle in the EU would significantly change the way in which markets function today, with different impacts depending on the type of stakeholder, the category of transaction and the type of security. Quantifying some of the costs and benefits related to the shortening of the settlement cycle in the EU is challenging because of the lack of data, but the elements assessed by ESMA suggest that the benefits of a move in terms of risk reduction, margin savings 9 and the reduction of costs incurred because of inefficiencies stemming from the misalignment with other major jurisdictions globally, represent important benefits for the S avings and I nvestments U nion . Moreover, investment in modernising , harmonising and improving the efficiency and resilience of post-trade processes that would be prompted by a move to T+1 would facilitate achieving the objective of further promoting settlement efficiency in the EU, promoting market integration and ultimately the Savings and Investments Union , and avoiding a competitive disadvantage for EU capital markets, which could see traders favour other, more efficient markets. Finally, maintaining the current settlement cycle in the EU would contribute to further fragmenting the S avings and I nvestments U nion as different EU stakeholders would continue to implement divergent solutions to cope with shorter settlement in most of the world’s capital markets.  Most of the identified costs associated with a move to T+1 would manifest in the short term, and are related to the investments needed to modernise, standardise and digitalise various steps in the settlement process. On the other hand, the elements assessed by ESMA suggest that the impact of T+1 in terms of risk reduction, margin savings and the reduction of costs linked to the misalignment with other major jurisdictions globally, represent important benefits for the competitiveness of EU capital markets and for moving towards the Savings and Investments Union and would ultimately improve the efficiency of EU capital markets and hence maintain their competitiveness at global level. 10  Settling securities transactions on T+1 is already technically and legally possible in the EU. Hence a move to T+1 could be left entirely in the hands of the EU securities industry to coordinate and carry out. However, the higher level of complexity of EU financial markets - due to the number of different actors, systems and currencies involved - compared to other jurisdictions that already moved to T+1, would make coordinating the process extremely challenging for that industry and would not provide legal or even planning certainty.  These aspects have also been highlighted in the Joint Statement by ESMA, the Commission and the ECB on shortening the standard securities settlement cycle in the EU, published on 15 October 2024 (‘Joint Statement’) 11 . The Joint Statement pointed out the need for the EU to urgently act through a coordinated approach if it wants to avoid prolonging and amplifying the negative impacts of the misalignment in settlement cycles with major jurisdictions internationally and ensure an efficient and competitive S avings and I nvestment U nion .  Therefore, this proposal aims to ensure that all stakeholders have sufficient time to prepare and move to T+1 in a coordinated and timely manner.  It is hence proposed that the EU move to a shorter settlement cycle requiring the settlement of transactions that are currently subject to a settlement cycle in T+2 to take place at the latest on the first business day after the trading takes place. This would not prevent CSDs that are already technologically capable to do so, to voluntarily settle transactions on the same date as the trade date.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  The proposal is to amend CSDR by introducing a T+1 settlement cycle in the European Union, to improve the efficiency of settlement with the aim of increasing competitiveness and reducing risks to financial stability. The proposed legislative changes would contribute to the development of a more efficient post-trading landscape in the EU, in line with the objectives set out under CSDR Refit 12 . Moreover, this proposal is in line with the Commission’s objective of building a Savings and Investments Union, to facilitate capital flow across the EU to the benefit of consumers, investors and companies. The settlement of securities is at the core of capital markets. Fast, efficient and reliable settlement is therefore an essential pre-condition for developing the Savings and Investments Union. A shorter settlement cycle would enhance the attractiveness of EU markets and unlock important benefits, notably by achieving risk reduction, margin savings and the reduction of costs linked to misalignment with other major jurisdictions globally .  • Consistency with other Union policies  This initiative aims to complement the broader Commission agenda to make EU capital markets more competitive and resilient. A competitive and efficient post-trade environment, of which the settlement cycle is a pivotal feature, is an essential element to achieve the Savings and Investments Union objectives. A fully functioning and integrated market for capital will allow the EU’s economy to grow in a sustainable way and be more competitive, in line with the strategic priorities of the Commission, focused on creating the right conditions for job creation, growth and investment.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  The legal basis for this proposal is Article 114 of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union, which is the legal basis for the CSDR. The main objective of the CSDR is to increase the safety and efficiency of securities settlement and settlement infrastructures in the EU. This initiative proposes to revise the duration of the settlement cycle in the Union, shortening it from two to one business day after the trade, therefore the related legislative proposal would be adopted under the same legal basis.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  According to the principle of subsidiarity provided in Article 5(3) of the Treaty on European Union, action at Union level should be taken only when the aims envisaged cannot be achieved sufficiently by Member States alone and can, because of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved by the EU.  The objectives of the CSDR, namely, to lay down uniform requirements for the settlement of financial instruments in the EU, rules on the organisation and conduct of CSDs and to promote safe, efficient and smooth settlement, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States alone, as the co-legislators acknowledged in 2014 when adopting the CSDR and in 2023 when adopting CSDR Refit.  Notably, the CSDR introduced a requirement for a mandatory settlement period for most transactions in transferable securities executed on a trading venue in the EU, setting this period at two business days after trading takes place. It is then appropriate that the shortening of such settlement period is undertaken through the same legal instrument.  This approach is further supported when considering the fragmentation of the landscape of EU post-trade infrastructures and the differences in the Member States’ capital markets and legal frameworks, which would make a common move to T+1 more challenging, were it not coordinated at EU level. The adoption of diverging practices by EU CSDs and trading venues with respect to the misalignment of global settlement periods would entail complexities and risks, further fragmenting EU capital markets and creating unfavourable conditions for participants and investors. As such, the aim of this initiative to shorten the settlement cycle in the Union and thus remove misalignments with the global economy, in view of strengthening the competitiveness and efficiency of the EU post-trade environment, cannot be sufficiently achieved by Member States alone. Therefore, by reason of the scale of actions, these objectives can be better achieved at EU level in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5(3) of the Treaty on European Union.  • Proportionality  The proposal aims to remove the misalignment between EU and international settlement cycles in a proportionate, effective and efficient manner.  Shortening the settlement cycle would provide a greater alignment with global markets, significantly streamlining processes for all cross-border market participants and would reduce risks and costs for securities listed or traded simultaneously in T+1 jurisdictions and in the EU. Due to the number of different actors, systems and currencies involved in the EU financial market, an entirely autonomous transition to T+1 by the Member States would be challenging, inefficient and more costly. EU level action is necessary to adequately achieve the objective of introducing a shorter settlement cycle in the EU and unlock the related benefits. The proposal does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve its objectives.  • Choice of the instrument  The CSDR is a Regulation and thus it needs to be amended by a legal instrument of the same nature.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  Given the nature and the urgency of the initiative, which relates to a targeted amendment of Article 5(2) of CSDR to introduce a shorter settlement cycle in the Union, and the related preparatory work, the Commission services did not consider it appropriate to conduct an ex-post evaluation of existing legislation. During the preparation of the Staff Working Document accompanying this proposal, the Commission services have analysed the impacts of the targeted amendment in light of international developments and have considered the feedback received by stakeholders and the analysis set out in the ESMA Report.  • Stakeholder consultations  The Commission has consulted stakeholders throughout the process of preparing this proposal. In particular through:  · A roundtable 13 organised by the Commission on 25 January 2024 on moving to a shorter settlement cycle in the EU. Attendees included high-level representatives from a broad range of sectors of the industry (buy-side 14 , sell-side 15 , retail investors, market infrastructures), from leading regulatory authorities, as well as representatives of the European Parliament and European Central Bank. Although a range of views were expressed, the majority of participants supported a legislative change to move to T+1. They acknowledged that although a move to a shorter settlement cycle can bring benefits, notably in the long term, those benefits were difficult to quantify. They were of the view that the short-term benefits would predominantly materialise through a realignment with other jurisdictions, notably the US, and collateral savings, while the main medium- to long-term benefits would be a greater level of automation of the whole settlement chain and the continued competitiveness of EU capital markets. The participants were almost unanimous about the need for coordination between European jurisdictions; there was also a consensus that a misalignment between the EU and the US was not manageable in the long term. An informal poll held at the roundtable on the dates of a potential move showed that the majority (54%) supported a 2027/2028 move, while 34% supported an earlier move and 12% would favour a later move.  · A Member States’ experts meeting held on 5 September 2024, to discuss a potential shortening of the settlement cycle in the EU 16 . The vast majority of Member States expressed their support for shortening the settlement cycle to T+1 and considered that a move to T+1 would lead to more efficient and timely settlement and increase the attractiveness of EU capital markets for investors. Furthermore, they considered that the stability of markets would improve, and liquidity would be more efficiently used due to a reduction of settlement related risks and costs. Member States were also of the view that a move should be signalled through an amendment to the CSDR. They supported a simultaneous move for all financial instruments rather than a phased one. Finally, they stressed that for the move to T+1 to be successful, thorough preparation, including the development of a detailed roadmap, would be essential.  • Collection and use of expertise  In preparing this proposal the Commission relied on external expertise and data from the following sources:  · ESMA :  – the responses to a 3-month call for evidence on shortening the settlement cycle, launched by ESMA on 5 October 2023 to which 81 responses were received . T he feedback received was summarised and published on 21 March 2024 17 ;  – the findings from ESMA’s industry workshop held on 4 December 2023 18 ;  – the findings from ESMA’s public hearing 19 organised on 10 July 2024; and  – t he ESMA report under Article 74(3) of CSDR submitted to the Commission on 18 November 2024.  · Advisory Group on Market Infrastructures for Securities and Collateral (AMI-SeCo) : during its plenary meeting on 26 June 2024, the AMI-SeCo, which advises the Eurosystem on issues related to financial market infrastructures, underlined that there is a need for a process to (i) develop an implementation timetable for an EU move to T+1, (ii) monitor market preparedness and (iii) identify areas where solutions must be developed. A majority of AMI-SeCo participants expressed the view that the EU should not wait for a formal cost-benefit analysis and urged EU decision makers to signal as soon as possible the intention to move as well as a target date for the transition. In addition, the AMI-SECO called for setting up as soon as possible a body to coordinate the move. 20  · European T+1 Task Force: the task force, which includes a wide representation of members from the buy-side, sell-side and market infrastructures 21 , was established in July 2023 by market participants to seek an industry wide agreement and present their views on the impacts of the US transition to T+1 on EU stakeholders and on a potential move to T+1 in the EU. It was set up following a report by the Association for Financial Markets in Europe ( AFME ) on the potential benefits and challenges of moving to T+1 in Europe 22 . The report concluded that many of the benefits and challenges of a US migration to T+1 would also be applicable to European markets. However, given the nature of European markets which, in comparison to the US, have a multitude of currencies, market infrastructures, and actors to coordinate, the implementation would be more complex than in the US. The task force published a second report in October 2024 23 , reiterating its support for a move to T+1 in the EU, and recognising the potential benefits in terms of efficiency improvements and risk reduction. They considered that a move to T+1 would be a complex, multi-year undertaking, which requires the collaboration of all industry stakeholders to ensure that no new risks are introduced or the existing efficiency, liquidity and functioning of EU securities market are not damaged. In terms of scope, the task force supported aligning to the scope of the CSDR, albeit excluding securities financing transactions 24 . The task force’s members generally considered that, once a concrete transition date is communicated, a transition period of between 24 and 36 months would be required, reflecting the complexity of the market infrastructure landscape in the EU. A range of views were expressed as to whether the second half of 2027, the date identified for the UK transition, also could be a feasible implementation date for the EU. The task force remained highly supportive of a coordinated approach across the entire European region, including the EEA, the United Kingdom and Switzerland.  The above has been complemented by input, at times including confidential quantitative and qualitative information, provided by financial markets participants during bilateral meetings.  • Impact assessment  Due to the urgency to act given international developments, Commission services opted to prepare a Staff Working Document analysing the impacts of an EU move to a shorter settlement cycle. A derogation from the requirement to produce a fully-fledged impact assessment has been granted. The Staff Working Document took into account the ESMA Report assessing the costs and benefits of a shorter settlement cycle in the EU. The Staff Working Document pointed out that greater automation and standardisation of core back-office and post-trade processes, including a substantial increase in the use of straight-through processing, will be needed to enable the move to T+1. It indicated that the magnitude of the investment needs will vary from one market participant to another depending on their business model, the number of CSDs and CCPs they are connected to and whether previous investments have been made to comply with T+1 in other jurisdictions. It also highlighted that these mostly one-off costs should, over time, be outweighed by the long-term benefits of lower counterparty and market risks, more efficient and timely settlement and increased attractiveness of EU capital markets for investors. It concluded that given the fragmented nature of EU capital markets, coordination and cooperation of market participants is not only useful but essential to ensure a smooth move to T+1.  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  The initiative aims to enhance the competitiveness and attractiveness of the EU post-trade landscape by introducing a shorter settlement cycle in the EU. As such, it does not aim at reducing regulatory burdens and costs per se. C osts associated with a move to T+1 would manifest in the short term, related to the investments needed to modernise, standardise and digitalise various steps in the settlement process. These costs would be borne by financial entities . However, the expected benefits, such as increased automation and efficiency, risk reduction, lower margin requirement and elimination of misalignment-related costs and frictions, should, over time, largely outweigh the mostly one-off costs stemming from necessary investments that a move to T+1 would entail.  • Fundamental rights  The EU is committed to high standards of protection of fundamental rights and is signatory to a broad set of conventions on human rights. In this context, the proposal is not likely to have a direct impact on these rights, as listed in the main United Nations conventions on human rights, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union which is an integral part of the EU Treaties, and the European Convention on Human Rights.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  The proposal will have no implications for the budget of the Union.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  This proposal does not require an implementation plan or monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements.  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  Article 1 introduces a targeted amendment to Article 5(2) of the CSDR, requiring that for transactions in scope of Article 5(2) 25 , the intended settlement date shall be no later than on the first business day after the trading takes place. This proposal does not amend the scope of application of Article 5(2).  2025/0022 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 as regards a shorter settlement cycle in the Union  (Text with EEA relevance)  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank 26 ,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 27 ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 28 regulates the settlement period for most transactions in transferable securities executed on trading venues . W ith certain exceptions, the intended settlement date for such transactions is to be no later than on the second business day after the trading takes place. Such period is referred to as the ‘ settlement cycle ’ . T he requirement for the settlement to take place at the latest on the second business day after the trading takes place is referred to as ‘settlement cycle in T+2’, or, simply, ‘T+2’.  (2) Longer settlement periods for transactions in transferable securities increase risk s for transaction parties and reduce opportunities for buyers and sellers to enter into other transactions. For th ose reason s , many third-country jurisdictions have moved, are in the process of moving, or plan to move, to a settlement period of one business day after the trade (‘T+1’). T he global shift to shorter settlement period s is , however, creating misalignments between U nion and global financial markets. Those misalignments will only further increase when more countries move to T+1 settlement and increas e the cost caused by such misalignments for U nion market participants.  (3) In its r eport on the appropriateness of shortening the settlement cycle in the E uropean U nion , published on 18 November 2024, the European Securities and Markets Authority concluded that shortening the settlement cycle in the Union to T+1 would significantly reduce risks in the market, in particular with respect to counterparty and volatility risks, and free up capital no longer required to cover margin calls. T+1 would also enable U nion capital markets to keep up with the evolution of other global markets, eliminating the costs associated with the current misalignment of settlement periods. It would also contribute to further harmonisation of corporate event standards and market practices in the U nion and more generally to the competitiveness of U nion capital markets. The Commission shares those conclusions.  (4) It is therefore appropriate to introduce a targeted amendment to Regulation (EU) 909/2014 in order to shorten the current mandatory settlement cycle to one day after the trading takes place. Such shortening of the settlement cycle would not prevent central securities depositories from voluntarily settl ing transactions on the same date as the trade date , where technologically capable .  (5) Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 should therefore be amended accordingly.  (6) Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely to introduce a shorter settlement cycle in the Union, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of their scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.  (7) To ensure that all relevant stakeholders involved are sufficiently prepared and able to move to T+1 settlement in a coordinated and timely manner, t he date of application of this Regulation should be deferred .  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Article 1  Amendment to Regulation (EU) No 909/2014  In Article 5 of Regulation (EU) No 909/2014, paragraph 2 is replaced by the following:  ‘2.

of 8 October 2025
amending Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 as regards a shorter settlement cycle in the Union
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee(2),
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure(3),
Whereas:
(1) Article 5(2) of Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council(4)regulates the settlement period for most transactions in transferable securities executed on trading venues. With certain exceptions, the intended settlement date for such transactions is to be no later than on the second business day after the trading takes place. Such a period is referred to as the ‘settlement cycle’. The requirement for settlement to take place at the latest on the second business day after the trading takes place is referred to as the ‘T+2 settlement cycle’, or, simply, as ‘T+2’.
(2) Longer settlement periods for transactions in transferable securities increase the risks to the transaction parties and reduce the opportunities for buyers and sellers to enter into other transactions. For those reasons, many third-country jurisdictions have moved, are in the process of moving, or plan to move to a settlement period of one business day after the trading takes place (‘T+1’). The global shift to shorter settlement periods is, however, creating misalignments between Union and global financial markets. Those misalignments will further increase when more countries move to T+1 settlement, thereby increasing the costs to Union market participants caused by such misalignments. Furthermore, some capital markets have already shortened the settlement cycle for certain types of transactions to T+0. In the Union, central securities depositories already settle a non-negligible number of transactions on a T+0 basis.
(3) In its report of 18 November 2024 on the assessment of the appropriateness of shortening the settlement cycle in the European Union, the European Supervisory Authority (European Securities and Markets Authority) (ESMA), established by Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council(5), concluded that shortening the settlement cycle in the Union to T+1 would significantly reduce risks in the market, in particular with respect to counterparty and volatility risks, and free up capital no longer required to cover margin calls. The T+1 settlement cycle would also enable Union capital markets to keep up with the evolution of other global markets, eliminating the costs associated with the current misalignment of settlement periods. It would also contribute to the further harmonisation of corporate event standards and market practices in the Union, and more generally to the competitiveness of Union capital markets. The Commission shares those conclusions.
(4) It is therefore appropriate to introduce a targeted amendment to Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 in order to shorten the current mandatory settlement cycle to no later than one business day after the trading takes place. That shortening of the settlement cycle would not prevent central securities depositories from voluntarily settling transactions on the same date as the trade date, where technologically feasible.
(5) Securities financing transactions allow market participants to manage their liquidity and funding needs in a flexible manner. Market trends indicate a growing use of such transactions on trading venues. Certain securities financing transactions that are executed on trading venues would fall within the scope of the T+1 settlement cycle requirement. However, given the non-standardised nature of such transactions and, in particular, the non-standardised settlement periods that might need to be agreed to by the parties to such transactions to achieve their objectives, and to avoid discouraging their execution on trading venues, those transactions should be exempt from the T+1 settlement cycle requirement. At the same time, to avoid any risk of circumvention of the T+1 settlement cycle requirement, the exemption should apply only if the securities financing transactions in question are documented as single transactions composed of two linked operations. As a consequence, and for the purposes of the T+1 settlement cycle requirement, undocumented securities financing transactions should be subject to that requirement. An explicit exemption is not needed for margin lending transactions as they are not transactions in transferable securities and therefore fall outside the scope of the T+1 settlement cycle requirement.
(6) Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 provides for various measures to address settlement fails, including cash penalties imposed on failing participants. The calculation of those cash penalties is determined by parameters specified in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/389(6). The Commission is expected to keep track of market developments, the volume of settlement fails and the readiness of the industry to comply with the T+1 settlement cycle requirement, and to consider, accordingly, whether there is a significant risk that the move from a T+2 to a T+1 settlement cycle requirement would lead to a material increase in settlement fails. Where such a risk is identified, the Commission is able, where necessary, to consider whether to adjust Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/389 accordingly, or to take any other appropriate measure within the scope of the empowerments laid down in Regulation (EU) No 909/2014, in order to mitigate both financial and non-financial adverse consequences. Any adjustments should be temporary, proportionate to the objective and designed to avoid imposing excessive costs on the industry.
(7) ESMA should monitor settlement efficiency during the move to a T+1 settlement cycle and should report thereon with increased frequency during the months immediately preceding and immediately following that move. In light of the exemption from the T+1 settlement cycle requirement for certain types of securities financing transactions pursuant to this Regulation, ESMA should pay particular attention to the settlement efficiency of securities financing transactions traded on or outside trading venues.
(8) Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(9) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely to introduce a shorter settlement cycle in the Union, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.
(10) To ensure that all relevant stakeholders involved are sufficiently prepared and able to move to the T+1 settlement cycle in a coordinated and timely manner, the date of application of this Regulation should be deferred,

Article 2

This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in theOfficial Journal of the European Union.
It shall apply from 11 October 2027.
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.
Done at Strasbourg, 8 October 2025.",https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202502075,"The European Commission has proposed a regulation aimed at shortening the securities settlement cycle in the EU from two business days (T+2) to one business day (T+1). This initiative seeks to enhance the efficiency and competitiveness of EU capital markets, which are vital for supporting the EU's digital, green, and social transitions. Despite efforts to integrate these markets, they remain fragmented, which hinders their development. Reports from 2024 highlight the need for innovation in post-trade services, which are crucial for the issuance, settlement, and risk management of securities.

Currently, over EUR 4 trillion in securities are settled daily in EU central securities depositories (CSDs). Longer settlement periods increase risks for buyers and sellers, delay investors' access to funds or securities, and limit opportunities for further transactions. The proposal aligns with a global trend towards shorter settlement cycles, with countries like the US, China, India, and Canada already adopting T+1. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) recommends moving to T+1 by October 2027, citing benefits such as risk reduction, margin savings, and alignment with global markets.

Shortening the settlement cycle would require significant changes in market operations, impacting various stakeholders differently. While the transition may incur short-term costs related to modernizing and digitalizing settlement processes, the long-term benefits include improved market integration and avoiding competitive disadvantages for EU markets. Maintaining the current T+2 cycle could further fragment the market.

CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  Eurojust, the European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation, supports the cooperation and coordination between national competent authorities in the investigation and prosecution of serious cross-border crime cases.  The National Member of the Member State requesting Eurojust’s support opens a case in the Eurojust Case Management System (CMS) and uses this IT-system to exchange case related information with the National Members of the other Member States (or liaison prosecutors in case of third countries) involved in the specific case. The purpose of the CMS is to facilitate the storage and exchange of sensitive personal operational data in a secure manner, in full compliance with data protection safeguards, and respecting strict retention periods. The CMS is thereby the beating heart of Eurojust’s support to national authorities.  The current CMS is technically outdated, which was one of the reasons for the Commission to propose an amendment to the Eurojust Regulation in 2021, which was adopted as Regulation (EU) 2023/2131 as regards digital information exchange in terrorism cases. The latter Regulation includes provisions on the CMS enabling a new, more flexible technical design, and providing for a transitional period, which allows the continued use of the ‘old’ CMS until 1 December 2025. The Commission’s proposal was accompanied by a legislative financial statement to ensure that Eurojust would receive the necessary financial and human resources to set-up the new CMS with all necessary functionalities until this deadline.  In a letter to the Commission sent in December 2024, Eurojust raised its concern about its ability to comply with the statutory deadline for the set-up of the new CMS. This has been confirmed in later discussions. The main reasons for the delay are difficulties with the external contractor supporting the development of the ‘new’ CMS. Additionally, the migration of data from the ‘old’ to the ‘new’ CMS and the verification of data is taking much more time than anticipated, in particular as it requires manual interventions due to the complicated structure of the ‘old’ CMS and the involvement of the national desks.  The Eurojust Regulation obliges Eurojust to store all operational personal data in the CMS and sets out a prohibition to store operational personal data elsewhere. The relevant transitional provision in the Eurojust Regulation was proposed with the explicit purpose to allow Eurojust to continue to use the old CMS until the statutory deadline of 1 December 2025, but at the same time to set a final time limit to such use.  Using the ‘old’ CMS beyond the transitional period provided for in the Eurojust Regulation would expose Eurojust to liability for the unlawful processing of operational personal data. Such unlawful processing of data could be challenged in national judicial procedures and ultimately be brought before the European Court of Justice. National courts might consequently consider information and evidence exchanged with the support of Eurojust inadmissible, which could have a negative impact on the prosecution of the crime at hand, and which could have a significant negative impact on the combat against serious cross-border crime and the security in the Union.  As the transitional rules for Eurojust’s “Core International Crimes Evidence Database”, in which evidence relating to international crimes including the crime of aggression against Ukraine is stored, and which was established based on Regulation (EU) 2022/838, are also linked to the statutory deadline of 1 December 2025, such concerns apply equally to evidence stored in that database. The failure to integrate that database into the ‘new’ CMS and the continued processing of data outside of the ‘new’ CMS after 1 December 2025 could negatively impact the admissibility of the evidence collected in the framework of the International Centre for the Prosecution of the Crime of Aggression against Ukraine, embedded in Eurojust, which could even have adverse effects on prosecutions before a future Special Tribunal for the Crime of Aggression against Ukraine.  Therefore, the Commission is proposing a technical amendment to the relevant provision of the Eurojust Regulation to ensure that the use of the ‘old’ CMS remains lawful until the ""new"" CMS is fully operational, and the relevant data has been transferred to the ‘new’ CMS.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  The set-up of a new, state-of-the-art CMS for Eurojust, including a better integrated, updated European Judicial Counter-Terrorism Register, is in line with the Digitalisation of Justice Strategy 1 , the EU Security Union Strategy 2 and the Counter-Terrorism Agenda for the European Union 3 .  • Consistency with other Union policies  The proposal is in line with the European data protection acquis. It sets out clear transitional rules applicable to the continued use of the ‘old’ CMS and the starting of the ‘new’ CMS and sets clear safeguards for the transitional period.  The proposal is also in line with the overall digitalisation of the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice, in particular the interoperability framework 4 . The ‘ new ’ CMS will enhance interoperability with other IT-systems established in the Area of Freedom Security and Justice and will facilitate exchanges and searches in the European Search Portal.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  The legal basis of the amendment of Eurojust’s legal basis is Article 85 Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Under Art. 85 TFEU, Eurojust’s structure, operation, field of action and tasks are to be determined by a regulation. This also includes the establishment and functioning of the Agency’s CMS.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  According to the principle of subsidiarity laid down in Article 5(3) of the Treaty on European Union (TEU), action at EU level should only be taken when the aims cannot be sufficiently achieved by Member States alone and can therefore, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved at EU level. There is also a need to match the nature and intensity of a given measure to the identified problem.  There is a specific need for EU action because the measures envisaged have an intrinsic EU dimension. They aim at improving the ability of Eurojust to act, through the exchange of operational personal data in the CMS in a secure manner. It is Eurojust’s mission to support and strengthen coordination and cooperation between national judicial authorities in relation to serious crime, including terrorism, affecting two or more Member States or requiring a prosecution on common bases. This objective can only be achieved at the EU level, in line with the subsidiarity principle. Member States cannot create a more appropriate legal framework for dealing with possible delays in the set-up of the ‘new’ CMS. It is therefore up to the EU to establish the legally binding instruments to achieve these results in line with the powers conferred upon it by the EU treaties.  • Proportionality  According to the principle of proportionality laid down in Article 5(4) TEU, there is a need to match the nature and intensity of a given measure to the identified problem. All problems addressed in this proposal call for EU-level support for Member States to tackle these problems effectively.  This proposal aims at mitigating the delay in the set-up of the 'new' CMS and its significant consequences, by proposing a technical amendment of the relevant provision of the Eurojust Regulation to ensure that the use of the ‘old’ CMS remains lawful until the ‘new’ CMS is fully operational. Without this amendment, Eurojust is unable to continue storing operational personal data in the ‘old’ CMS after the expiry of the current statutory deadline, while it cannot store these data elsewhere. Consequently, it will not be able to fulfil its crucial role in supporting and strengthening cooperation between Member States’ national authorities in the investigation and prosecution of serious forms of crime, including terrorism. To enable Eurojust to fully perform its crucial task, it is necessary to ensure a transitional period that allows the migration from the ‘old’ to the ‘new’ CMS.  Therefore, in line with the principle of proportionality, the proposal does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve this objective.  • Choice of the instrument  Under Article 85(1) TFEU, Eurojust's legal framework shall be defined by a Regulation. Any amendment of this legal framework also requires a regulation.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  Not Applicable  • Stakeholder consultations  Not Applicable  • Collection and use of expertise  Not Applicable  • Impact assessment  Not Applicable  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  Not Applicable  • Fundamental rights  The Eurojust CMS has been established to ensure the secure handling of operational personal data and compliance with retention periods set out in the Eurojust Regulation. To avoid any circumvention of these rules, the Eurojust Regulation prohibits to store operational personal data anywhere outside the CMS.  To migrate data from the ‘old’ CMS to the ‘new’ CMS and to verify the correctness of the migrated data, the two systems will need to run in parallel for a certain period. That will lead to a duplication of data and impact the principle of data minimisation. However, the purpose of this temporary duplication is to enable the secure transition to the new technical infrastructure, which will consider the data protection by design principle and ensure at the same time highest ICT security standards and therefore provide better data protection safeguards by default. There is also no other, quicker means to migrate the data from the ’old’ to the ‘new’ CMS. Much of the data stored, for example attachments, have individualised access rights, which need to be maintained manually in the migration. In addition, each national desk stored data in a different manner, which is why this data needs to be migrated with support and involvement of the staff of each national desk. The migration is therefore also dependent on their workload and availability. The duplication is limited to the extent necessary. Eurojust may only use the ‘old’ CMS until the migration and verification of data is concluded, with a fixed maximum time limit of 1 December 2027. Therefore, this impact on data minimisation is justified.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  This proposal does not have any budgetary implication for the EU budget.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  Not Applicable  • Explanatory documents (for directives)  Not Applicable  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  The proposed amendment extends the statutory deadline set out in Article 80(9) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1727 for maintaining the ‘old’ CMS and the establishment of the ‘new’ CMS from 1 December 2025 to 1 December 2027. This change will give Eurojust two additional years to ensure a successful transition to the ‘new’ case management system.  In addition, following the last half-sentence of Article 80(9) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1727, which provides that the ‘old’ CMS would need to stop operations, when the ‘new’ CMS has taken up operations, an additional half-sentence is added to ensure that Eurojust can migrate the data from the ‘old’ CMS to the ‘new’ CMS. The migration from the ‘old’ to the ‘new’ CMS requires significant manual intervention as every national desk of Eurojust stores information and attachments in a different way, a process which will require several months. After the data has been migrated, its accuracy will need to be verified before the ‘old’ CMS can stop operations. However, this transitional phase must be limited in time. The ‘old’ CMS may only be used until the ‘new’ CMS is in place and the migration and verification of the accuracy of the data have been completed, or until the final statutory deadline of 1 December 2027, beyond which the ‘old’ CMS may not be used anymore. This extended statutory deadline gives Eurojust enough time to establish the ‘new’ CMS, while setting a maximum time limit in the legal basis itself.  2025/0074 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulation (EU) 2018/1727 as regards the extension of the timeframe for the establishment of the Eurojust case management system  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 85 thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) Regulation (EU) 2018/1727 of the European Parliament and of the Council 5 establishe s the European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation ( Eurojust ) and sets out its tasks, competence and functions.  (2) To store all operational personal data securely, Eurojust established a c ase m anagement s ystem composed of temporary work files and an index . Through the c ase m anagement s ystem, n ational m ember s of Eurojust exchange all case related information securely and in full compliance with the data protection rules . Eurojust may not establish any other automated data file to process operational personal data.  (3) Regulation (EU) 2023/2131 of the European Parliament and the Council 6 amended Regulation (EU) 2018/1727 to provide the legal framework for a modernised case management system. Th at new case management system is to integrate and enable the functionalities of the European Judicial Counter-Terrorism Register and improve Eurojust’s ability to identify links between cross-border judicial proceedings against suspects of terrorist offences and information processed at Eurojust relating to other cases of serious crimes while taking, as a rule, full advantage of existing national and Union mechanisms for comparing biometric data.  (4) T he deadline for setting up the new case management system is 1 December 2025 . However, due to external factors and the complexity of the migration , Eurojust will not be able to set up the new case management system within th at deadline. Therefore, until the new case management system is set up, it is necessary to provide that Eurojust may continue to use the case management system composed of temporary work files and an index .  (5) To allow Eurojust to test and ensure the operationality and interoperability of the new case management system in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2024/903 of the European Parliament and of the Council 7 , and to migrate the data from the case management system composed of temporary work files and an index to the new case management system, it is necessary to extend the deadline.  (6) Eurojust should be able to maintain the case management system composed of temporary work files and an index after the new case management system has taken up operations to migrate the data from the case management system composed of temporary work files and an index to the new case management system and verify the correctness of the migrated data, but not beyond the 1 December 2027 . The extension of the current timeframe for the establishment of the new case management system by two years should give Eurojust sufficient time to fin a lise the set-up of the new case management system , while limiting the period within which the duplication of operational personal data is exceptionally permitted .  (7) [In accordance with Articles 1, 2 and 4a(1) of Protocol No 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and without prejudice to Article 4 of that Protocol, Ireland is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application.] OR [In accordance with Article 3 and Article 4a(1) of Protocol No 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Ireland has notified [, by letter of …,] its wish to take part in the adoption and application of this Regulation.]  (8) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No 22 on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union , Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application.  (9) The European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with Article 42 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 and delivered an opinion on [...],  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Article 1  Amendments to Regulation (EU) 2018/1727  In Article 80 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1727, paragraph 9 is replaced by the following:  '9. Eurojust may continue to use the case management system composed of temporary work files and an index until 1 December 2027, unless the new case management system is already in place, and the migration of the data from the case management system composed of temporary work files and an index, and verification of their accuracy have been completed before.’  Article 2  Entry into force  This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union .

Objective(s)  1.3.1. General objective(s)  Based on amending Regulation 2023/2131, Eurojust is working on the set-up of a new case management system (CMS). Due to delays in the development by the external contractor and the long period the migration of data will require, Eurojust will not be able to set-up the “new” CMS and to migrate all operational data from the “old” to the “new” CMS within the legal deadline. The overall objective is to ensure the continued legality of data processing at Eurojust by extending the legal deadline for the set-up of the “new” CMS.  1.3.2. Specific objective(s)  The specific objective derives from the general objective as outlined above:  Specific objective 1:  To ensure that prosecution cases at national level supported by Eurojust cannot be challenged based on the claim that Eurojust held data in an unlawful manner.  Specific objective 2:  To ensure that Eurojust can test the new system and migrate the operational data from the old to the “new” CMS.  1.3.3. Expected result(s) and impact  Specify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.  Smoothen the transition from the “old” to the “new” CMS and ensure the legality of the data throughout the process.  1.3.4. Indicators of performance  Specify the indicators for monitoring progress and achievements.  - Setup of the new CMS and migration of data from the “old” to the “new” CMS by the 1 December 2027.  1.4. The proposal/initiative relates to:   a new action   a new action following a pilot project / preparatory action 8   the extension of an existing action   a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action  1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative  1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative  Eurojust will have to finalise the development, consult the European Data Protection Supervisor, set-up and test the “new” CMS and migrate the operational data from the “old” to the “new” CMS and verify the correctness of the data until 1 December 2027.  1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, great er effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this section 'added value of EU involvement' is the value resulting from EU action, that is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.  The “new” CMS will render Eurojust’s support to national competent authorities more efficient and facilitate the work of the Eurojust national desks significantly by digitalising processes. It will enable better identification of cross-border links between cases opened in different Member States and therefore enhance the fight against serious cross-border crime.  1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past  The development of large IT projects often entails significant delays as the development is difficult to predict. Also here, the development was delayed by difficulties with the external contractor and unexpectedly and unpredictably long period, which the migration of operational data from the “old” to the “new” CMS will require. Hence, the deadline is extended for another two years.  1.5.4. Compatibility with the multiannual financial framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments  This proposal does not have any budgetary implication for the EU budget. The budgetary impact for the set-up of the “new” CMS is already covered by the legislative financial statement accompagnying Regulation (EU) 2023/2131.  1.5.5.

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 85 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure(1),
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EU) 2018/1727 of the European Parliament and of the Council(2)establishes the European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation (Eurojust) and sets out its tasks, competence and functions.
(2) To store all operational personal data securely, Eurojust established a case management system composed of temporary work files and an index. Through the case management system, national members of Eurojust exchange all case-related information securely and in compliance with the applicable data protection rules. Pursuant to Article 23(6) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1727, Eurojust is not permitted to establish any other automated data file to process operational personal data.
(3) Regulation (EU) 2023/2131 of the European Parliament and of the Council(3)amended Regulation (EU) 2018/1727 to provide the legal framework for a modernised case management system (the ‘new case management system’). The new case management system is to integrate and enable the functionalities of the European Judicial Counter-Terrorism Register and improve Eurojust’s ability to identify links between cross-border judicial proceedings against suspects of terrorist offences and information processed at Eurojust relating to other cases of serious crimes while taking full advantage of existing national and Union mechanisms for comparing biometric data.
(4) The deadline for setting up the new case management system is 1 December 2025 (the ‘deadline’). However, due to external factors and the complexity of the migration, Eurojust will not be able to set up the new case management system by the deadline. It is therefore necessary to allow Eurojust to continue to use the case management system composed of temporary work files and an index until the new case management system is set up.
(5) To allow Eurojust to test and ensure the operationality and interoperability of the new case management system in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2024/903 of the European Parliament and of the Council(4), and to migrate the data from the case management system composed of temporary work files and an index to the new case management system, it is necessary to extend the deadline.
(6) In order to migrate the data from the case management system composed of temporary work files and an index to the new case management system and to verify the accuracy of the migrated data, Eurojust should be able to maintain the case management system composed of temporary work files and an index after the new case management system has become operational, but not beyond 1 December 2027. The extension of the deadline by two years should provide Eurojust with sufficient time to finalise the setting up of the new case management system, while limiting the period within which the duplication of operational personal data is, exceptionally, permitted.
(7) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 and Article 4a(1) of Protocol No 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and without prejudice to Article 4 of that Protocol, Ireland is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application.

HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

Article 1

In Article 80 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1727, paragraph 9 is replaced by the following:
‘9.   Eurojust may continue to use the case management system composed of temporary work files and an index until 1 December 2027, unless the new case management system is already in place, and the migration of the data from the case management system composed of temporary work files and an index, and the verification of the accuracy of those data, have been completed before that date.’.

Article 2

This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in theOfficial Journal of the European Union.
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in the Member States in accordance with the Treaties.
Done at Strasbourg, 8 October 2025.",https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202502082,"The European Commission has proposed an extension for Eurojust, the EU agency tasked with coordinating cross-border criminal investigations, to transition to a new case management system (CMS). This system is crucial for securely exchanging data among national authorities, but the current CMS is outdated and requires an upgrade to improve functionality and security. Originally, the transition was scheduled for completion by December 2025, but significant delays have occurred due to challenges with the external contractor and the complex data migration process.

To address these issues, the proposal seeks to legally extend the use of the old CMS beyond the initial deadline, ensuring Eurojust can continue its operations without legal repercussions for data handling. This extension is vital to prevent potential legal challenges that could affect the admissibility of evidence in court cases. The proposal aligns with broader EU strategies for digitalization and data protection, aiming to enhance the interoperability of justice systems across the EU. By allowing more time for the transition, the proposal aims to ensure a smooth and secure upgrade to the CMS, supporting Eurojust's mission to combat serious cross-border crime effectively.

The proposed amendment extends the deadline for maintaining the old CMS and establishing the new CMS from December 1, 2025, to December 1, 2027. This change provides Eurojust with two additional years to ensure a successful transition.

CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified full-scale invasion of Ukraine since 24 February 2022 has had a profound negative impact on Ukraine’s ability to trade with the rest of the world. In this difficult context, the European Council underlined in its conclusions of 27 October 2023 and 15 December 2023 (as reconfirmed on 19 December 2024) that it will continue to provide strong political and economic support to Ukraine for as long as it takes.  Ukraine has requested the Union to make it as easy as possible for it to maintain its trade position with the rest of the world and to further deepen its trade relations with the Union. Measures to this end have included market access liberalisation for Ukrainian exports through Regulation (EU) 2022/870 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2022 1 and Regulation (EU) 2023/1077 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 May 2023 2 on temporary trade-liberalisation measures supplementing trade concessions applicable to Ukrainian products under the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement. Regulation (EU) 2024/1392 entered into force on 6 June 2024 and will remain in force until 5 June 2025 3 . These measures have increased flexibility and certainty for Ukrainian producers.  Ukraine is still a major exporter of iron and steel, despite the fact that the war has caused the destruction or occupation of many production facilities . It therefore remains necessary to maintain the suspension of Regulation (EU) 2015/478 on common rules for imports 4 . This suspension is and would remain the legal basis for the suspension of the Union’s current safeguard measure on steel products ( vis-à-vis such imports from Ukraine ) as part of the Union ’s support.  For this purpose, it is necessary to suspend Articles 2, 4-7, 9-17 and 19-21 of Regulation (EU) 2015/478 on common rules, as far as imports from Ukraine are concerned.  In view of this need to continue to support Ukraine economically, the Commission is proposing a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council to suspend the application of Articles 2, 4-7, 9-17 and 19-21 of Regulation (EU) 2015/478 on common rules for imports with respect of imports originating in Ukraine.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  The suspension of Regulation (EU) 2015/478 on common rules for imports would be consistent with the EU’s strong support of Ukraine by means of international trade in the context of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine.  • Consistency with other Union policies  The Union has strongly condemned Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine and has taken unprecedented steps to support Ukraine in this exceptional context. These steps include financial assistance (including macro-financial assistance for emergency measures and reconstruction); the delivery of military equipment; the adoption of extensive sanctions against Russia and Belarus; and the intensification of cooperation under the Association Agreement. In addition, Ukraine was granted EU candidate status in June 2022 and Accession Negotiations were opened in December 2023.  The proposed regulation would therefore comply with and follow on from the Union’s obligation under Article 21(3) of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) to ensure consistency between the different areas of its external action. It would also comply with Article 207(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which requires the common commercial policy to be conducted in the context of the principles and objectives of the Union’s external actions.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  The legal basis for the proposal is Article 207(2) of the TFEU.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  The subsidiarity principle does not apply because, in accordance with Article 3(1)(e) of the TFEU, the common commercial policy is an exclusive Union competence.  • Proportionality  This proposal is necessary in order to achieve the objective of supporting Ukraine in its current difficulties economically, including in the area of trade with the Union.  • Choice of the instrument  This proposal is in accordance with Article 207(2) of the TFEU, which envisages common commercial policy measures.  3. RESULTS OF EX POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  Not applicable.  • Stakeholder consultations  Not applicable.  • Collection and use of expertise  Not applicable.  • Impact assessment  In order to ensure the continuation of the trade-liberalisation measures for Ukraine after the expiry of Regulation (EU) 2024/1392 on 5 June 2025, it is necessary for the proposed Regulation to enter into force on 6 June 2025. This urgent need means that there has not been sufficient time to carry out an impact assessment. However, the trade and trade-related provisions of the Association Agreement have been subject to a sustainability impact assessment that the Commission’s Directorate-General for Trade commissioned in 2007 and which fed into the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) negotiation process. That study confirmed that the implementation of trade and trade-related provisions would have a positive economic impact on the EU as well as on Ukraine.  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  The measure does not increase the regulatory burden on companies.  • Fundamental rights  These measures respect the same basic principles as those enshrined in the Association Agreement between the EU and Ukraine. In particular, Article 2 of the Association Agreement with Ukraine provides that that Agreement’s essential elements are (i) respect for democratic principles, human rights and fundamental freedoms; and (ii) respect for the principle of the rule of law.  The trade-liberalising measures would also be in accordance with the European Charter on Fundamental Rights for three reasons. Firstly, their direct effect is that imports from Ukraine can be subjected to fewer restrictions than would be the case if surveillance and safeguards applied to imports from Ukraine. Secondly, the Union could not thereby fail in its duty to protect fundamental rights under the Charter because the protection of any fundamental rights in question (where necessary) remains possible by other means. Thirdly, as regards the unequal treatment of importers or users of products originating in Ukraine (compared with that of importers or users of products originating in other third countries that are not exempted from surveillance and safeguards), such an unequal treatment is applied in other cases where the Union’s bilateral trade agreements exempt imports from safeguard measures and is a legitimate exercise (including the use of a proper legal basis) of the Union’s common commercial policy for the purpose of closer economic integration.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  Not applicable.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  Not applicable.  • Explanatory documents (for directives)  Not applicable.  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  Given the economic situation in Ukraine, this proposed Regulation is intended to protect the market access conditions for imports from Ukraine by suspending certain provisions on the surveillance and safeguards in Regulation (EU) 2015/478 on common rules for imports.  2025/0056 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  suspending certain parts of Regulation (EU) 2015/478 as regards imports of Ukrainian products into the European Union  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 207(2) thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure 5 ,  Whereas:  (1) The Association Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community and their Member States, of the one part, and Ukraine, of the other part (the Association Agreement) 6 constitutes the basis of the relationship between the Union and Ukraine. In accordance with Council Decision 2014/668/EU 7 , Title IV of the Association Agreement, which relates to trade and trade-related matters, entered into provisional application on 1 January 2016 and entered into force on 1 September 2017, following ratification by all Member States.  (2) The Association Agreement strengthen s and widen s the Parties relations in an ambitious and innovative way , with a view to facilitat ing and achieve ing gradual economic integration ; and to do so in accordance with the rights and obligations arising out of the Parties’ membership of the World Trade Organization .  (3) Regulation (EU) 2015/478 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 2015 8 lays down common rules for imports originating in most third countries, including Ukraine . It also contain s provisions on surveillance and safeguard measures.  (4) Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified full-scale invasion of Ukraine has , since 24 February 2022 , had a profoundly negative impact on Ukraine’s ability to trade with the rest of the world . This has been the case for iron and steel , for example , because of the occupation or destruction of iron and steel production facilities . It has also been the case for other parts of the Ukrainian economy .  (5) In these circumstances and in order to mitigate the negative economic impact of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, it is appropriate, for Ukraine’s benefit, to exempt Union imports originating in Ukraine from Union surveillance and safeguard measures. For this purpose, it is necessary to suspend various provisions of Regulation (EU) 2015/478 on common rules for imports from Uk r aine.  (6) T he Commission should be able to temporarily suspend the application of this Regulation in resp e ct of a specific product by means of a n implementing act . Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council 9 . The duration of such suspension should be long enough to allow the Commision to make a proposal ; and for the Parliament and Council to adopt a R egulation suspending, amending or terminating this Regulation.  (7) This Regulation should apply for three years and its application should be tacitly renewed for further three year periods u nless and until either the European Parliament or the Council would oppose such an extension three months before the expiry date.  (8) In light of the forthcoming expiry on 5 June 2025 of Regulation (EU) 2024/1392 of the European Parliament and of the Council 10 , which provides , among other things , for effects equivalent to the effects of this Regulation , this Regulation should enter into force on 6 June 2025 ,  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Article 1 Trade-liberalisation measures  The application of Article 2, Articles 4 to 7, Articles 9 to 17 and Articles 19 to 21 of Regulation (EU) 2015/478 on common rules for imports shall be suspended with regard to imports into the Union originating in Ukraine.  Article 2 Temporary suspension  The Commission shall be empowered to adopt an implementing act to suspend the application of this Regulation in respect of a specific product for a period that in principle shall not exceed twelve months, if imports of this product that originate in Ukraine increase to a level that contributes significantly to the serious injury or threat of serious injury to a Union industry that produces the like or directly competitive product. That implementing act shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 3(2).  Article 3  Committee procedure  1. The Commission shall be assisted by the Committee on Safeguards with regard to Article 4 of this Regulation. That Committee shall be a committee within the meaning of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011.  2. Where reference is made to this paragraph, Article 5 of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 shall apply.  Article 4  Entry into force and application  This Regulation shall enter into force on 6 June 2025.  It shall apply for an initial period of three years.  Its application shall be tacitly extended for successive periods of three years unless the European Parliament or the Council opposes such an extension no later than three months before the end of each period.  This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.

(As an agreement was reached between Parliament and Council, Parliament's position corresponds to the final legislative act, Regulation (EU) 2025/1153.)",,,,"The European Commission has proposed a regulation to temporarily suspend certain parts of an existing EU regulation governing the import of Ukrainian products, particularly steel, to support Ukraine amid economic challenges caused by Russia's invasion. This proposal is part of the EU's broader strategy to assist Ukraine through financial aid, military support, and sanctions against Russia, aligning with the EU's commitment to its foundational principles. By reducing restrictions on imports from Ukraine, the regulation aims to provide economic relief and enhance Ukraine's market access within the EU, benefiting both parties without increasing the regulatory burden on companies. The suspension is designed to respect fundamental rights and principles, consistent with the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement, which emphasizes democratic values, human rights, and the rule of law.

The regulation is set to enter into force on June 6, 2025, coinciding with the expiry of a related regulation, and will initially apply for three years, with the possibility of renewal unless opposed by the European Parliament or the Council three months before its expiry. The Commission will have the authority to suspend the regulation for specific products if their import levels significantly harm EU industries producing similar products. This decision will follow a committee procedure involving the Committee on Safeguards. Additionally, the proposal includes anti-fraud measures, requiring Ukraine to comply with conditions under the Association Agreement, including rules of origin and administrative cooperation. The proposal is expected to have no financial implications on the EU budget."
