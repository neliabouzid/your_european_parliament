CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  Annexes A and B are decisive in defining the scope of application of Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on insolvency proceedings. They list exhaustively those insolvency proceedings or insolvency practitioners, respectively, of the Member States’ laws, to which the Regulation applies. It is, therefore, important that these Annexes are regularly updated in order to reflect the actual legal situation in the Member States.  Pursuant to Article 1(1), to point (4) of Article 2 and to recital (9) of the Regulation, national proceedings qualify as ‘insolvency proceedings’ in the context of the Regulation only if they are listed in Annex A thereto. Similarly, pursuant to point (5) of Article 2 and to recital (21) of the Regulation the persons and bodies that comply with the definition of ‘insolvency practitioner’ of the Regulation are listed in Annex B.  In July 2022, Slovakia notified the Commission on recent changes of its domestic insolvency law introducing a new preventive restructuring procedure as well as a new type of insolvency practitioner. This was followed by notifications from Estonia, Spain, Malta, and Italy in September 2022, from Belgium in July 2023 and from Luxembourg in January 2024.  The Commission has analyzed the notifications of the said Member States in order to ensure compliance of the notifications with the requirements of the Regulation.  Regulation (EU) 2015/848 should therefore be amended accordingly.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  Regulation (EU) 2015/848 is an important instrument of civil judicial cooperation at EU level. The efficient treatment of cross-border insolvencies of debtors with their centre of main interests in a Member State requires that the scope of the Regulation reflects the actual state of play of domestic insolvency laws. This proposal aims at ensuring that the scope of the Regulation is adjusted to the actual legal framework of the Member States on insolvency by the time of its application.  Directive (EU) 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending Directive (EU) 2017/1132 (Directive on restructuring and insolvency) 1 establishes minimum standards both for preventive restructuring procedures available for debtors in financial difficulty, when there is a likelihood of insolvency, and for procedures leading to a discharge of debts incurred by over-indebted entrepreneurs and allowing them to take up a new activity. National insolvency proceedings transposing this Directive may be covered by the scope of Regulation (EU) 2015/848, if they comply with the requirements of the Regulation vis-à-vis national insolvency proceedings and are included in Annex A of the Regulation.  • Consistency with other Union policies  The Regulation has an important supportive role to the freedom of establishment, to the freedom to provide services and to the free movement of persons.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  The proposal is based on Article 81 (2) (a), (c) and (f) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  Regulation (EU) 2015/848 falls under the shared competence of the European Union. Regulation (EU) 2015/848 provides for a comprehensive set of rules directly applicable to cross-border insolvency proceedings which are referred to in the Annex A and to types of insolvency practitioners referred to in Annex B.  The current proposal however merely modifies these Annexes to accurately reflect the content of national notifications and adapt the Annexes containing the lists of national procedures, or types of insolvency practitioners, respectively, in this field. These changes do not affect any of the obligations and rules set out in the Regulation itself.  As a result, as long as the substantive provisions of the Regulation remain unchanged, changes to Annexes A and B of the Regulation do not affect the substantive set of rules and may only be made by the Union legislature and not by the Member States. Consequently, the amendments to these Annexes are an exclusive competence by nature, and thus are not subject to the subsidiarity test and to the ex-ante review procedure of Protocol No 2 to the Treaties, as the subsidiarity principle is not applicable in the situation at stake.  • Proportionality  The proposal complies with the proportionality principle for the following reasons:  The Commission Proposal replaces the lists in Annexes A and B to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 with new lists taking into account the information notified by the said Member States. Since Annexes A and B are intrinsic part of the Regulation, their modification can only be achieved via the legislative amendment of the Regulation.  The Regulation is directly applicable in the Member States. It is published in the Official Journal of the European Union, therefore its contents are accessible to all interested parties.  • Choice of the instrument  The proposed instrument is a regulation.  Other means would not be adequate for the following reasons:  Under the current legislation, Annexes A and B to the Regulation can only be amended by a regulation to be adopted in the ordinary legislative procedure, under the legal base applied to the original Regulation. Such an amendment shall be proposed by the Commission.  Slovakia, Estonia, Spain, Malta, Italy, Belgium and Luxembourg notified the Commission of amendments to the lists set out in Annexes A and B. Accordingly, the Commission does not have any other option but to propose amendments to these Annexes to the Regulation, insofar as these amendments comply with the requirements set out in the Regulation.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  The envisaged amendments are of a purely technical nature. They contain no substantive change to the Regulation. For such initiatives, in line with the Better Regulation Guidelines of the European Commission, no impact assessment is required.  Furthermore, pursuant to Article 81 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, after the request of the Slovakia to initiate the necessary legislative procedure, followed by similar requests of Estonia, Spain, Malta, Italy, Belgium and Luxembourg, no choice remained available to the Commission, but to comply with these requests, insofar as they fulfil the requirements set out in the Regulation. The preparatory work for the adoption of this proposal did not require any new expertise.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  The proposal has no budgetary implications.  2025/0023 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulation (EU) 2015/848 on insolvency proceedings to replace its Annexes A and B  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 81(2), points (a), (c) and (f) thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) Annexes A and B to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council 2 list the designations given in national law of the Member States , respect ively, to the insolvency proceedings and to the insolvency practitioners to which that Regulation applies. Annex A lists the insolvency proceedings referred to in Article 2 , point (4) , of Regulation (EU) 2015/848 and Annex B lists the insolvency practitioners referred to in Article 2, point (5) , of that Regulation .  (2) In July 2022, Slovakia notified the Commission o f recent changes of its domestic insolvency law introducing a new preventive restructuring procedure and a new type of insolvency practitioner. That notification was followed by notifications from Estonia, Spain, Malta and Italy in September 2022, from Belgium in July 2023 and from Luxembourg in January 2024, all relating to recent changes to their domestic law that introduce new types of insolvency proceedings or insolvency practitioners. Those new types of insolvency proceedings and insolvency practitioners comply with the requirements set out in Regulation (EU) 2015/848 and make it necessary to amend Annexes A and B to that Regulation.  (3) In accordance with [ Articles 1 and 2 ] [ in case of non- participation ] [ Article 3 ] [ in case of participation ] and Article 4a(1) of Protocol No 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, [Ireland has notified [, by letter of …,] its wish to take part in the adoption and application of this Regulation]/[without prejudice to Article 4 of th at Protocol, Ireland is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not be bound by it or subject to its application].  (4) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No 22 on the position of Denmark, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application.  (5) Regulation (EU) 2015/848 should therefore be amended accordingly,  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Article 1  Annexes A and B to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 are replaced by the text set out in the Annex to this Regulation.

CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  This proposal seeks to amend Regulation (EU) 2018/196 by including a de minimis threshold for the imposition of retaliation applied in relation to the WTO dispute on the United States’ Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act of 2000 (‘CDSOA’, or the Byrd Amendment ). It also seeks to align the regulation to what is provided in the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-Making.  The CDSOA mandates the yearly distribution of the anti-dumping and countervailing duties collected during the previous fiscal year to US companies. The CDSOA was found incompatible with the United States' WTO obligations in January 2003.  Given that the United States failed to bring itself in compliance with its obligations under the WTO agreements, the Union was authorised to impose an additional import duty above bound customs duties on a list of US products covering on a yearly basis a total value of trade not exceeding the amount of 72 % of the CDSOA disbursement from duties collected on imports from the Union for the most recent year for which data are available. Since 1 May 2005, the Union applies an ad valorem additional customs duty on imports of certain products originating in the United States 1 on a yearly basis, adjusting the level of retaliation proportionately to the amount disbursed from duties collected on Union products in the most recent distribution.  Given the large number of modifications of the initial legal basis (i.e., Council Regulation (EC) No 673/2005) via delegated acts, a codification exercise was undertaken in February 2018. A codified version of the legal basis, Regulation (EU) 2018/196, was adopted by the European Parliament and the Council on 7 February 2018.  By applying the mandated formula to the latest CDSOA distribution of anti-dumping and anti‑subsidy duties collected during the Fiscal Year 2023 (1 October 2022 – 30 September 2023), the resulting level of retaliation to apply as from 1 May 2024 amounted to USD 34,98. That level of retaliation of USD 34,98 represented a significant decrease as compared to the previous level of retaliation and was economically negligible. It would have resulted in subjecting sweet corn, frames and mountings for spectacles, crane lorries, and certain items of women’s or girls’ apparel in denim that originate in the US to an ad valorem additional rate of duty of 0,00002% as from 1 May 2024. As applying such a low duty would have had no trade impact and would have imposed a disproportionate administrative cost to the Union, with Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2024/1239 the additional rate of duty as from 1 May 2024 was set at 0 %. In order to set the duty to 0 % and respect the obligations imposed by the basic Regulation on the Commission, a Delegated Regulation had to enter into force.  The Byrd Amendment was repealed in 2006, but the US created a transitional period whereby disbursements would continue as long as they concerned duties collected before 1 October 2007. Given that the mandated formula is based on the amount of disbursements made in one fiscal year and that the last remaining imports subject to the CDSOA have been liquidated in Fiscal Year 2023, it is expected that in the future the authorised level of retaliation will continue to remain low and will go towards exhaustion. However, it is not possible to determine when the distribution process will end, as disbursements connected to these final imports and amounts held pending litigation are still expected to be made.  Having to adopt a Commission Delegated Regulation each year, even when retaliation is negligible, is not an efficient use of resources. Thus, in order to promote efficiency and proportionality, a de minimis threshold below which additional import duties should not be imposed should be added to Regulation (EU) 2018/196. This threshold should be set at USD 30 000 of CDSOA disbursements made by US authorities in relation to Union imports in one fiscal year (which would correspond to an authorised level of retaliation of USD 21 600).  Disbursement amounting to USD 30 000, keeping the current list of goods in Annex I, would result in an additional rate of duty of about 0,01 %. Additional custom duties equal or below 0,01 % that would apply in the absence of a de minimis provision on the few tariff lines currently included in Annex I do not appear to justify the administrative costs that would be incurred by the Union if these duties were imposed. Below this threshold the duties have no trade impact and are thus economically negligible.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  The proposal is consistent with existing Union trade policy insofar as it preserves the Union’s rights under WTO law while ensuring an efficient use of the Union’s resources.  • Consistency with other Union policies  The proposal is consistent with the Union policies that strive for a more efficient use of human and administrative resources.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  The legal basis for this Regulation Amendment is Article 207(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  The common commercial policy, in accordance with Article 3(1), point (e) of the TFEU, is defined as an exclusive Union competence. Therefore, the subsidiarity principle does not apply.  • Proportionality  This proposal is proportionate as it is necessary in order to ensure an efficient use of the Union’s resources. Having to adopt a Commission Delegated Regulation when retaliation is negligible is not an efficient use of resources.  • Choice of the instrument  This proposal is in accordance with Article 207(2) TFEU, which envisages common commercial policy measures.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  Not applicable.  • Stakeholder consultations  Not applicable.  • Collection and use of expertise  Not applicable.  • Impact assessment  The legislative proposal is not supported by an impact assessment. This is in line with the better regulation toolbox, which provides that an impact assessment may not be necessary for ‘policy initiatives that propose limited changes based on a thorough evaluation, which has clearly identified the necessary amendments to a policy or legislation’. The Commission considers that the proposed regulation fulfils these criteria.  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  The measure does not increase the regulatory burden of companies.  • Fundamental rights  The proposal has no consequences for the protection of fundamental rights.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  Whenever the de minimis would apply, the European Union would see a loss of maximum USD 21 600 (which is the authorised level of retaliation corresponding to USD 30 000 of CDSOA related disbursements) of customs revenue in one fiscal year. On the other hand, the human and administrative resources necessary to adjust and impose the additional customs duty would not be used. Therefore, the impact on Union’s own resources will be very limited.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  Not envisaged.  • Explanatory documents (for directives)  Not applicable.  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  This proposal introduces a de minimis threshold below which additional import duties should not be imposed. This threshold should be set at USD 30 000 of relevant disbursements made by US authorities in one fiscal year. Disbursement amounting to USD 30 000, keeping the current list of goods in Annex I, would result in an additional rate of duty of about 0,01 %. Additional custom duties equal or below 0,01 % that would apply in the absence of a de minimis provision on the few tariff lines currently included in Annex I do not appear to justify the administrative costs that would be incurred by the Union if these duties were imposed. Below this threshold the duties have no trade impact and are thus economically negligible.  Moreover, this proposal adjusts the language of Article 3(3) of Regulation (EU) 2018/196 in order to align it to the standard clauses contained in the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-Making.  2025/0012 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulation (EU) 2018/196 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 February 2018 on additional customs duties on imports of certain products originating in the United States of America  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 207(2) thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) On 27 January 2003, the Dispute Settlement Body (‘DSB’) of the World Trade Organization (‘WTO’) adopted the Appellate Body report 2 and the Panel report 3 , as upheld by the Appellate Body report, finding that the Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act (‘CDSOA’) was incompatible with the United States' obligations under the WTO agreements.  (2) Since the United States failed to bring its legislation into conformity with the WTO agreements, the European Community (‘Community’) requested authorisation from the DSB to suspend the application of its tariff concessions and related obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (‘GATT’) 1994 to the United States 4 . The United States objected to the level of suspension of tariff concessions and related obligations, and the matter was referred to arbitration.  (3) On 31 August 2004, the Arbitrator determined that the level of nullification or impairment caused every year to the Community was equal to 72 % of the amount of CDSOA disbursements relating to anti-dumping or countervailing duties paid on imports from the Community for the most recent year for which data were available at that time, as published by the United States' authorities. The Arbitrator concluded that the suspension by the Community of concessions or other obligations, in the form of the imposition of an additional import duty above bound custom duties, on a list of products originating in the United States covering, on a yearly basis, a total value of trade not exceeding the amount of nullification or impairment would be consistent with WTO rules. On 26 November 2004, the DSB granted the authorisation to suspend the application to the United States of tariff concessions and related obligations under GATT 1994 in accordance with the decision of the Arbitrator.  (4) As a result of the United States’ failure to bring the CDSOA in compliance with its obligations under the WTO agreements, pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/196 of the European Parliament and of the Council 5 a 4,3 % ad valorem additional customs duty was imposed on imports of certain products originating in the United States. In conformity with the WTO authorisation to suspend the application of concessions to the United States, the Commission is to adjust the level of suspension annually to the level of nullification or impairment caused by the CDSOA to the Union at that time.  (5) In recent years, the level of nullification or impairment caused to the Union on the basis of the data published by the United States' Customs and Border Protection has decreased. For example, in 2024, it was calculated at USD 34,98 resulting in a rate of additional import duty of 0,00002 %. As collecting this additional import duty would have no trade effect but result in a disproporti o nate admini s trative cost for the Union, the rate of additional import duty was set at 0 % by Commission Dele g ated Regulation (EU) 2024 /1239 6 , which amend ed Regulation (EU) 2018/196 accordingly.  (6) Given that the CDSOA was effectively repealed on 1 October 2007 , it is expected that the level of nullification or impairment and , consequently , of suspension will stay at this significantly decreased and economically negligible level.  (7) To ensure efficient processes and avoid disproporti on ate admin is trative costs for the Union, Regulation (EU) 2018/196 should be amended by including a de minimis threshold below which no additional import duty should be imposed .  (8) The de minimis threshold should be set at USD 30 000 of disbursements under the CDSOA relating to anti-dumping and countervailing duties paid on imports from the Union for the most recent year for which data are available at that time, as published by the United States' authorities (U.S. Customs and Border Protection). Below such threshold , the additional import dut y, as resulting from the formula mandated by the WTO authorisation, would have no trade impact and would thus be economically negligible. It would also cause disproportionate administrative costs for the Union .  (9) Additionally, Article 3(3) of Regulation (EU) 2018/196 should be amended and a lign ed to the standard clauses contained in the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-Making 7 .  (10) Regulation (EU) 2018/196 should therefore be amended accordingly,  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Article 1  Amendments to Regulation (EU) 2018/196  Article 3 of the Regulation (EU) 2018/196 is amended as follows:  (1) The following paragraph is added :  4. Notwithstanding paragraph 1 of this Article, the application of the additional duty shall be suspended if the amount of disbursements under the CDSOA relating to anti-dumping and countervailing duties paid on imports from the Union for the most recent year for which data are available at that time, as published by the United States' authorities, is USD 30 000 or less.  (2) The first sentence of p aragraph 3 is replaced by the following:  The Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 4 to make the adjustments and amendments referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article.  Article 2  Entry into force  This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.  This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.

ANTI-FRAUD MEASURES  n/a  5. OTHER REMARKS  The method used for the estimation of impact on revenue was the following:  a. The legislative proposal introduces a de minimis of USD 30 000 of US relevant disbursements.  b. USD 30 000 of US relevant disbursements correspond to an authorised level of additional duties of USD 21 600 .  c. Thus, if the threshold of the de minimis , were not to be met, the highest possible loss of revenue in one fiscal year would be USD 21 599.  d. To this amount (that would have otherwise been collected as customs duty) 2 5 % wa s deducted for collection costs, resulting in USD 1 6 199 ,2 5 .  e. The resulting amount was then converted into euro (conversion rate of 26/12/2024), resulting in EUR 15.586,69 .  Given that the maximum possible impact of revenue (i.e., EUR 15.586,69) is negligible, the proposal is considered to have no financial impact.",['https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-10-2025-0050_EN.html'],"European Parliament legislative resolution of 1 April 2025 on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council  amending Regulation (EU) 2018/196 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 February 2018 on additional customs duties on imports of certain products originating in the United States of America ( COM(2025)0027 – C10-0007/2025 – 2025/0012(COD) )

(As an agreement was reached between Parliament and Council, Parliament's position corresponds to the final legislative act, Regulation (EU) 2025/783.)",,,,"The European Commission has proposed a legislative amendment aimed at refining the process of imposing additional customs duties on certain imports from the United States. This proposal is a response to the U.S.'s Byrd Amendment, which was found to violate World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. The amendment introduces a ""de minimis"" threshold of USD 30,000 for the disbursement of duties collected from the EU. If disbursements fall below this threshold, no additional duties will be imposed, which is intended to reduce administrative burdens and costs for the EU. This change aligns with EU trade policies by maintaining compliance with WTO obligations while promoting efficient resource use.

The proposal is part of the EU's common commercial policy, an area of exclusive competence for the Union. It is considered proportionate as it avoids unnecessary administrative costs when retaliation is negligible. Historically, the U.S. was authorized to suspend tariff concessions under the WTO due to non-compliance with the Byrd Amendment, leading to a 4.3% ad valorem additional customs duty on certain U.S. imports. However, recent data shows a negligible level of nullification or impairment, resulting in a 0% additional import duty to avoid disproportionate administrative costs.

Given the effective repeal of the Byrd Amendment in 2007 and the continued low level of nullification or impairment, the proposal suggests amending existing regulations to include a de minimis threshold. Financially, the proposal is deemed to have no significant impact. The maximum potential"

a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions as regards requirements for securities financing transactions under the net stable funding ratio  (Text with EEA relevance)  {SWD(2025) 77 final}  EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM  1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  This proposal aims to amend Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (Capital Requirements Regulation or CRR) to maintain the current transitional approach to the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) requirement.  The NSFR requirement is part of the Basel III international standards, which the European Union (EU) agreed to implement as part of the wide-ranging reform of the prudential framework for banks in the aftermath of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis (GFC). The NSFR requirement aims to ensure that banks have stable funding sources to fund their activities and reduce their dependency on short-term wholesale funding. It was designed to mitigate maturity transformation risk, as a globally consistent regulatory requirement, aiming to foster convergence across jurisdictions and eliminate opportunities for cross-border regulatory arbitrage.  In particular, the Basel NSFR standard introduces a minimum requirement on the amount of stable funding that banks must issue to finance their activities, based on the liquidity profile of their assets. It mitigates a bank’s liquidity risk by setting a required stable funding (RSF) level based on the bank’s assets, which is then compared to the available stable funding (ASF) that results from their liability instruments.  Securities Financing Transactions ( SFT s) as defined u nder Article 4(1 ), point 139 of the CRR encompass different secured transaction types in which assets (collateral) are exchanged for cash: (i) rep urchase (rep os ) and reverse-repurchase (reverse-repos) , (ii) securities lending , (iii) buy-sell-back , and (iv) margin lending. Repos and reverse-repos make up the largest share of SFTs, account ing for 68% of the total, followed by securities lending ( 23% ) , buy-sell-back ( 8% ) , and margin lending ( 1% ) (September 2023 data) 1 .  A repo is a collateralised and generally short-term borrowing transaction. A reverse-repo is a collateralised lending transaction, mirroring a repo transaction, where a bank (the lender) temporarily purchases securities or commodities (i.e. collateral) from a counterparty (the borrower) in exchange for cash with a commitment to sell the collateral back in the future at a predetermined price.  Unsecured lending transactions are loans that are not secured by any collateral. They are based on the borrower’s creditworthiness and promise to repay. They were mainly found on the interbank markets before the GFC.  Since the GFC and the closure of the unsecured interbank markets, SFTs have play ed a crucial role in the circulation of short-term funding between banks and market players through collateralised transactions. SFT market activity also links the short-term money market to the longer-term capital market. The bulk of SFTs are collateralised by sovereign debt. SFT s are characterised as a high-volume, low-margin business activity for large banks, and th is wholesale market activity is prone to international competition as highlighted by the very cross-border nature of these transactions . Only 41% of the EU SFT amount s are between EU counterparties , meanwhile 59% of the EU SFT amount s involve one non-EU counterparty 2 .  For monies due from SFTs with maturities up to six months, the Basel NSFR standard requires a conservative non-zero RSF requirement on banks. The objective is to discourage excessive short-term exposures between banks, which may give rise to contagion during times of financial distress.  The NSFR standard was implemented in EU law on 20 May 2019 through an amendment of the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR2). The related requirements entered into application at the end of June 2021. In its proposal amending the CRR, published on 23 November 2016 3 , the Commission suggested the permanent use of RSF levels low e r than those included in the Basel accord . The Commission concluded at the time that ‘ it seems reasonable to bring limited changes to the treatment of both short-term transactions with financial institutions, and of HQLA Level 1 [ in order ] not to hinder the good functioning of EU financial and repo markets ’ . The arguments and analysis that led to this approach and the impact assessment accompanying the Commission proposal are still valid 4 .  The co-legislators , however, allowed for a transitional 0% RSF requirement – instead of the 10% RSF specified in the Basel III standards and the lower one (5%) proposed by the Commission – for monies due from SFTs with maturities up to six months , when collateralised with Level 1 High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) 5 , such as sovereign debt. This provision is set to expire in June 2025, when the non-zero RSF requirement set out in the Basel standard would start to apply. The transitional provision aimed to give banks sufficient time to adapt to the more conservative requirement imposed by the Basel standards and to mitigate any consequential effect on the EU capital market, and in particular on the sovereign debt market.  Similar transitional provisions were also agreed for short-term monies due from SFTs collateralised by assets other than Level 1 HQLA and for short-term unsecured transactions with financial customers. These exposures are relatively less material compared to monies due from SFTs collateralised by Level 1 HQLA. They are also characterised by higher margins. The considerations of the co-legislators when granting a transitional treatment for these transactions were their inherent funding characteristics and the impact of the level of RSF factors for these transactions on the market liquidity, especially of assets received as collateral in SFT transactions.  The transitional prudential charge defined by co-legislators maintains a difference in the stable funding requirement that is consistent with the Basel standard, between monies due from SFTs collateralised by Level 1 HQLA, such as sovereign bonds, and monies due from SFTs collateralised by other assets. It contributes however not to increase the pressure on very high-quality collateral, beyond addressing the sovereign-bank nexus. It also supports the market liquidity and the diversity of collateral assets eligible to the liquidity buffer of banks, under the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR).  As regards unsecured funding transactions with a residual maturity below six months, with financial customers, the transitional treatment aims to apply a proportionate funding requirement to these transactions, in line with their funding risk profile, and to support the revive of the unsecured funding market that vanished after the 2008 GFC. Unsecured funding transactions should indeed be considered as a necessary complement to secured funding transactions such as SFTs, to support overall market liquidity and monetary policy transmission, in particular during periods of monetary policy tightening.  The United States , the United Kingdom , Japan and Switzerland have adopted a similar treatment as the EU’s transitional treatment, but these countries have made it a permanent one . The US agencies argue that ‘ the 0% RSF factor assignment was made based on the determination that Level 1 HQLA pose minimal liquidity risk and contribute importantly to the good functioning of short-term funding markets, i.e. that a non-zero RSF factor on Level 1 HQLA could discourage intermediation in US Treasury and repo markets ’ 6 .  The end of the current transitional treatment and the resulting tightening of the NSFR requirement in the EU raises some concerns. It could discourage EU banks from intermediating in government debt and reduce the liquidity in these markets because these high-volume low-margin transactions would become more costly. Further increasing the costs of these transactions when operated by EU counterparties, while 59% of EU transactions already involve one non-EU counterparty, may develop the attractiveness of non-EU counterparties or non-EU capital markets. This would contradict the development and sustainability of capital markets and liquidity for collateral assets, such as sovereign bonds, in the EU. If the EU was to increase the RSF factors for these transactions, in a unilateral way, it would distort the international level playing field, putting EU banks at a disadvantage compared to non-EU peers operating on this very international and competitive activity. Somehow, reinforcing the unlevel playing field would be at odd with one of the initial objectives of the Basel standards to support the implementation of globally consistent regulatory requirements and to reduce opportunities for cross border regulatory arbitrage.  Conversely, maintaining the current treatment, in line with the approach retained by other jurisdictions, may support the development of a liquid and attractive sovereign debt market and a deep SFT market for EU collateral instruments.  The current requirements have proven to be prudentially sound since their entry into application in mid-2021 and do not seem to have raised any financial stability concerns, in particular during the recent stress episodes (Russian aggression, UK Gilt crisis, March 2023 banking turmoil). Since mid-2021, EU banks have built up strong NSFR buffers, beyond minimum requirements, subject to an ongoing supervision by competent authorities. Any effect of maintaining the transitional treatment will continue to be monitored and subject to adequate supervisory scrutiny, including on banks’ funding practices and liquidity risk profile, through ongoing supervision and periodic reports.  Under Article 510(7) of the CRR2, the Commission is required to assess the relevance of the transitional NSFR treatment of monies due from SFTs and unsecured transactions, with financial customers, with a residual maturity below six months, by the end of June 2024, based on a report from the European Banking Authority (EBA). As explained in Section 3, the EBA’s report only analysed the impact on banks’ NSFR levels, that appears negligible. However, a broader analysis points to possible undesirable effects of moving towards the RSF prescribed by Basel accord. The EU’s SFT market plays a crucial role in financing EU government debt as the bulk of SFTs are collateralised by sovereign debt. In addition, maintaining the transitional treatment supports the liquidity and diversity of assets that are also eligible to the liquidity buffer of banks under the LCR. It may indeed not be appropriate to disconnect the two dimensions of the liquidity requirements.  It is also important to maintain the existing steps between the RSF factors for sovereign bonds collateral and other collateral used in SFTs as doing otherwise would affect the preference for one or the other, thereby risking reinforcing the pressure on (scarce) high quality collateral, beyond contributing to the sovereign-bank nexus.  The unsecured funding market for banks has vanished after the 2008 GFC and has never been revived, at least not to a significant level. A non-zero RSF factor already applies to short-term unsecured transactions under the NSFR. An increase in this factor will not materially strengthen the prudential profile of banks, i.e. the impact on the NSFR would be negligible, while it may disincentivise the use of unsecured funding transactions that may prove helpful in a period of monetary policy tightening.  An increase in the RSF level applicable to monies due from SFTs and unsecured transactions could discourage EU banks from intermediating in government debt and other collateral and reduce liquidity in the EU capital markets overall. An increase in the RSF for these transactions will not lead to a material change in the average level of the NSFR ratio of EU banks that already appears above the minimum requirements and is already subject to an ongoing supervision by competent authorities. It will therefore not change fundamentally the prudential profile of EU banks. This, in turn, could increase funding costs for Member States and EU market players in a period of normalised monetary policy when central banks are expected to reduce their market presence and private market players are expected to take over.  To avoid possible unintended consequences on capital markets liquidity and considering the safeguards provided by the current framework for banks, the Commission proposes to maintain the transitional treatment for monies due from SFT and for unsecured transactions with a residual maturity of less than six months, with financial customers. In addition to the ongoing monitoring of capital market developments by central banks and to the ongoing supervision by competent authorities, the Commission also proposes to mandate the EBA to report the impact of this treatment every 5 years. This would allow the Commission to act accordingly and propose amendments if evidence emerges from these periodic monitoring reports.  · Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  Under Article 510(7) of the CRR, the co-legislators explicitly require the Commission to submit a legislative proposal, where appropriate. This proposal must take into account both the impact of the existing treatment on institutions’ NSFR and the funding risk associated with SFTs and unsecured transactions with a residual maturity of less than six months, with financial customers. The Commission’s mandate also includes maintaining the international level playing field in this area, which is particularly prone to international competition.  Maintaining the NSFR transitional treatment set out in Article 428r(1)(g), Article 428s(1)(b) and Article 428v(a) of the CRR is in line with this mandate.  First, while EU banks present adequate NSFR buffers above their minimum requirements and benefit from an ongoing supervision of their funding capacity, maintaining the transitional treatment will support the development of liquid capital markets in the EU and the availability of a diversified pool of eligible liquid assets under the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR). SFT transactions support the swift and orderly transformation of securities into cash at an economical price, thereby being a key element for the monetisation of liquidity pools. A negatively affected SFT market could endanger the effectiveness of the LCR, whose logic is to have a buffer of liquid assets that can be easily transformed into cash through SFTs or sold on markets, in case of a 30-day liquidity stress scenario.  Then, more broadly, maintaining the transitional treatment will keep the EU funding requirements aligned with other key jurisdictions and avoid an unilateral departure from the international consensus that may affect the level playing field for EU banks. A permanent approach will also give the necessary legal certainty to stakeholders in relation to the perennity and the stability of their business activities.  Finally, this approach – based on a periodic report by the EBA – also enables the Commission to propose amendments if evidence emerges supporting such amendments.  • Consistency with other Union policies  The proposed amendment to the CRR aims to preserve SFT market activity and the liquidity of sovereign debt markets in the EU, which will contribute to the efficiency of the EU banking and capital markets without undermining financial stability.  The assessment of the degree of alignment with international prudential standards, equally considered with its impact on the economy led to consider that the current transitional treatment did not lead to significant financial stability concerns, as illustrated in particular by the recent stress episodes (Russian aggression, UK Gilt crisis, March 2023 banking turmoil) that did not unveil heightened concerns in terms of funding risk at EU banks. While the end of the transitional treatment would not significantly affect the prudential profile of banks, it may negatively alter market liquidity, in particular on the sovereign debt market.  Maintaining the current transitional treatment on a steady state with regular reporting and ongoing supervision by competent authorities will provide legal certainty to market participants, thereby supporting the perennity and stability of their business activities. A stable prudential treatment for monies due from SFTs and unsecured transactions would also contribute to the stability of the reporting framework for banks, as a change of scope would require an adjustment of the dedicated templates.  Beyond maintaining the transitional treatment for SFTs collateralised by sovereign debt, continuing the transitional treatment for monies due from SFTs collateralised by other assets will support the diversification of banks’ liquidity buffers and the mitigation of the sovereign-bank nexus.  Keeping the RSF factor that applies since June 2021 to short-term unsecured transactions with financial customers will contribute to the use of these transactions in a context of monetary policy tightening, as a complement to secured transactions. This would in turn support overall capital markets liquidity and ultimately an adequate financing of the real economy.  By safeguarding the level playing field between the EU and other major jurisdiction that have already implemented, on a permanent basis, a similar NSFR prudential treatment, the proposed amendment will contribute to support the competitiveness and attractiveness of EU capital markets and the intermediation role of EU banks. Active EU intermediaries on SFT markets and deep liquid EU markets for collateral assets, such as sovereign bonds, ultimately contribute to lower funding costs for the overall EU economy.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  The proposed amendments are built on the same legal basis (Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)) as the legislative acts that are being amended.  • Subsidiarity  Under the principle of subsidiarity set out in Article 5(3) of the Treaty on the European Union, ‘in areas which do not fall within its executive competence, the Union shall act only if and in so far as the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, either at central level or at regional level and local level, but can rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved at Union level.’  Given that the objective of the proposed measure aims to amend existing EU legislation, it is best achieved at EU level rather than through different national initiatives. In fact, adopting national measures would be difficult from a legal standpoint, given that the CRR is directly applicable and already regulates banking liquidity and funding prudential requirements at national level.  In the banking sector, where many institutions operate across the EU single market, it is particularly important to ensure a standard application of prudential requirements, the convergence of supervisory practices and a level playing field for banking services.  • Proportionality  Under the principle of proportionality, the content and form of EU action should not exceed what is necessary to achieve the objectives of the Treaties.  The goals of the proposals are to ensure the competitiveness and the attractiveness of the EU economy through effective capital markets for SFTs, sovereign bond and other collateral assets, without creating additional financial stability risks for EU banks.  Under this proposal, the ability of EU banks to comply with NSFR requirement with substantive prudential buffers is maintained without excessively increasing their dependence on short-term funding.  In addition, the proposed amendments do not go beyond the scope of the transitional measures set out in Article 510(8) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. All other liquidity requirements imposed under Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 remain unchanged.  • Choice of the instrument  The measures are proposed to be implemented by amending the CRR. The proposed measures refer to or further develop existing provisions set out in the CRR. No other legal instrument would be possible.  3. RESULTS OF EX POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  Not applicable. The proposed amendment relates to a specific action in line with the Commission’s mandate, set out in Article 510(7) of the CRR, to submit a legislative proposal to address a very targeted aspect of the CRR (i.e. the RSF factors applicable to securities financing transactions and unsecured transactions, with a residual maturity of less than six months, with financial customers). This initiative is not an evaluation or revision of the CRR in its entirety.  • Stakeholder consultations  The Commission has taken several steps and carried out various initiatives to assess whether the current transitional treatment is still adequate for securities financing transactions and unsecured transactions with a residual maturity of less than six months, with financial customers, in light of the objectives of the prudential framework for banks and the EU’s broader policy objectives.  The Commission took into consideration the EBA report on specific aspects of the net stable funding ratio framework, which was published on 16 January 2024 and fulfils the requirement set out in Article 510(6) of the CRR 7 . However, t he EBA report did not cover all the relevant dimensions surrounding the issue , such as the impacts on monetary policy transmission , on sovereign bond markets and on other collateral markets . I t has been one element in the broader policy analysis carried out by the Commission.  The Commission discussed and exchanged views with various industry participants, supervisors and the European Central Bank (ECB).  The Commission also participated and contributed to the dedicated discussions of the s ub c ommittee of the Economic and Financial Committee on EU Sovereign Debt Markets , which re p resent s the views of Member States’ debt management offices. Members of the subcommittee reiterated the concerns reflected in Recital s 49 and 50 of the CRR 2 8 that SFTs are key tools for the transmission of monetary policy and are critical instruments for the primary and secondary market of sovereign debt . Increasing the prudential charge for SFTs would , according to the Members of the subcommittee, impact the level-playing field between EU and non- EU capital market - players and potentially affect negatively the liquidity and the cost of borrowing in European sovereign debt markets .  The Commission has considered the concerns raised publicly by three Member States on this issue 9 . EU SFT transactions are predominantly concentrated in a few Member States, with France being the primary domicile holding 55% of EU SFT borrowing in September 2023. Other counterparties are German (holding 17% of EU SFT borrowing), Italian (7%) and Irish (5%). This concentration may be explained by the central role of Central Counterparty Clearing Houses (CCPs) (LCH, EuroNext Clearing and EUREX Clearing) and banks domiciled in those Member States and acting as clearing members. F inancial institutions concentrate their exposures in Member States where CCPs operate for more efficient risk management and clearing. CCPs contribute to 20% of SFTs, using SFTs in their cash reinvestment strategy.  The European Commission published between 10 February and 10 March 2025 a call for evidence on its intention to amend the CRR on the prudential treatment of short-term SFTs for the purpose of the NSFR. A detailed summary is developed in the staff working document accompanying the proposal.  All these exchanges and consultations have highlighted the critical importance of efficient EU SFT, unsecured fundings and government bond markets at a time when the ECB is committed to changes to its monetary policy that gradually relies more on the SFTs and unsecured financial transactions markets to redistribute liquidity among financial intermediaries. Members states, debt management offices, banks and capital market intermediaries have called on the Commission to amend the current rules and maintain the transitional treatment.  • Collection and use of expertise  In addition to what is mentioned in the previous section, the Commission has maintained regular contact with staff in the EBA, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) and the ECB.  • Impact assessment  The EBA report on specific aspects of the Net Stable Funding Ratio framework finds that the end of the transitional measure would only have a limited impact on the average NSFR level of EU banks.  However, this limited impact conceals a more significant impact on banks that are more active in the capital markets. Moreover, some of these banks might also have a smaller management buffer because, in general, the NSFR is conservatively calibrated for these activities. The constant balance sheet assumption in the EBA report, which is based on the assumption that bank behaviour is not affected when minimum requirements are met, may not necessarily be appropriate. This is because it leaves out possible dynamic and behavioural impacts linked to a bank’s attempt to achieve a given target NSFR. The report also overlooks that non-EU banks may gain market share over EU banks based on an uneven international playing field.  An increase in the RSF level applicable to monies due from SFTs could discourage EU banks from intermediating in government debt and affect the liquidity in the collateral markets concerned. This could also lead to higher bid-ask spreads and an increase in funding costs for Member States in a period of normalised monetary policy when central banks are expected to reduce their market presence and private market players are expected to take over.  The possible implications for EU SFT and government bond market activity will depend on the extent to which banks can pass on an increase in the RSF factors to bid-ask spreads in the SFT market. The market-making role of the banks most affected may indicate a rather high or even a full pass-through of the regulatory cost. At the same time, banks might also have an incentive to limit this pass-through as it might attract competition from non-EU banks.  Any increase in the funding charge linked to the RSF level could have potential consequences for the liquidity of the sovereign debt markets, with implications for the liquidity of NextGenerationEU bonds. This would confirm the concerns raised at the time of the CRR2 proposal 10 .  The impact on non-EU banks operating in the EU SFT market is less clear. The activities concerned are normally carried out by EU subsidiaries, which would be subject to the same NSFR requirements than the one that apply to EU banks. However, they might be able to shift those activities to branches or cross-border operations, and, in any case, they would be able to back-to-back the activity with support from their parent company to neutralise the increase. In short, non-EU banking groups in certain jurisdictions could possibly neutralise the impact of an increase in the NSFR, considering that they would not face similar prudential requirements on these exposures after June 2025. This situation would, without specific EU action, lead to an uneven international playing field.  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  This initiative is very specific and targeted. As a result, it does not affect regulatory fitness or simplification.  • Fundamental rights  The EU is committed to high standards of protection of fundamental rights and is a signatory to a broad set of conventions on human rights. The proposal is not expected to have a direct impact on the rights listed in the main UN conventions on human rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which is an integral part of the EU Treaties and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  The proposal does not have implications for the EU budget.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  Beyond the regular capital market monitoring, supervisory reviews, stress testing exercises and data collection carried out by central banks and supervisory authorities, including at EU level, the proposal sets out that the EBA will also monitor the effects of the amendments on banks’ NSFR and the liquidity of the underlying collateral markets every five years. The development of the periodic monitoring report should not introduce an additional reporting burden on EU banks as it could rely on available market intelligence and existing supervisory reporting requirements.  • Explanatory documents (for directives)  Not applicable.  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  Article 1 deletes the transitional provision set out in Article 510(8) of the CRR in order to maintain the existing treatment for monies due from SFTs and unsecured transactions with a residual maturity of less than six months, with financial customers. Article 1 also amends Article 510(6) in order to introduce a periodic monitoring where the EBA is mandated to report to the Commission every five years on the appropriateness of the treatment. Article 510(7) becomes redundant and is therefore deleted.  2025/0077 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions as regards requirements for securities financing transactions under the net stable funding ratio  (Text with EEA relevance)  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank ( 11 ) ,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee ( 12 ) ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) Regulation (EU) 2019/876 of the European Parliament and of the Council 13 introduced into Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council 14 the N et S table F unding R atio (NSFR) requirement . That requirement reflect ed part of the Basel III standards, i.e. the international standards agreed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) which were developed to ensure that credit institutions have sufficient stable funding on a one-year horizon , and thus to prevent an excessive maturity mismatch between assets and liabilities and an overreliance on short-term wholesale funding. The NSFR requirement as laid down in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 has been applicable to credit institutions since 28 June 2021.  (2) Article 428r(1), point (g), Article 428s(1), point (b) , and Article 428v, point (a), of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 currently provide for the stable funding factors for monies due from financing transactions with financial customers, where those transactions have a residual maturity of less than six months. Those funding factors are, depending on the financing transaction concerned, 0%, 5% or 10%. Article 510 (8) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 , however, provides for a raise , by 28 June 2025 , of th ose funding factors to 10%, 15% a nd 15%, respectively. Th at deferred raise aimed at giving credit institutions sufficient time to gradually adapt to a more conservative calibration and to assess whether th at calibration was appropriate. In addition to that deferred raise , other adjustments were adopted to ensure that the introduction of the NSFR requirement did not disrupt the liquidity of the related collateral markets, including sovereign bonds markets.  (3) Under Article 510(6), of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, t he European Banking Authority (EBA) was mandated to assess the appropriateness of the treatment of the stable funding required to cover the funding risk linked to SFT s and unsecured transactions with financial customers where those SFTs and unsecured transactions have a residual maturity of less than six months. In line with th at mandate, the EBA delivered a report on specific aspects of the NSFR on 16 January 202 4 15 Th at report conclude d that a raise of the funding factors, as provided for in Article 510(8) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, would have a negligible impact on the levels of NSFR s of institutions. However, the report does not assess the broader dimension and spillover effects on the liquidity of the sovereign debt and bonds markets. T he considerations that led to the deferral of that raise still prevail. In particular, as the bulk of SFT s are collateralised by sovereign debt instruments, a raise in the related required stable funding could reduce the liquidity in the markets concerned . Th at could , in turn, risk creating additional funding costs for Member States and altering monetary policy transmission mechanisms.  (4) In addition, other BCBS member jurisdictions have set required stable funding levels for SFT s that are identical to those that are currently applicable . In th at context, given the intense international competition in the SFT market , a raise of the funding factors on 28 June 2025 would create an un even international playing field that would be detrimental to U nion financial markets.  (5) To avoid th o se unintended consequences, the current stable funding factors for SFT s and unsecured transactions with financial customers, where such transactions have a residual maturity of less than six months, as laid down in Article 428r(1), point (g), Article 428s(1), point (b), and Article 428v, point (a), of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 , should be made permanent.  (6) To ensure sufficient monitoring of the interactions with the market liquidity of assets received as collateral in SFTs and unsecured transactions with financial customers, where such transactions have a residual maturity of less than six months, including when collateralized by sovereign debt, the funding risk for credit institutions, and possible international developments in that area, the EBA should report to the European Commission every five years on the appropriateness of those stable funding requirements .  (7) To ensure the continuity of the prudential treatment for monies due f rom SFT s and for unsecured transactions, with financial customers , with a residual maturity of less than six months, as specified under Article 428r(1), point (g), Article 428s(1), point (b), and Article 428v, point (a), of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, the proposed Regulation should apply from 29 June 2025. Temporarily discontinuing the treatment would create legal uncertainty for market participants and undue administrative and financial burden for the Union bank ing sector in general that could be mitigated by clearly setting the expected date of application of the provisions concerned .  (8) Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 should therefore be amended accordingly ,  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Article 1 Amendments to Regulation (EU) No 575/2013  Article 510 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 is amended as follows:  (1) paragraph 6 is amended as follows:  (a) the first subparagraph is replaced by the following:  ‘The EBA shall monitor the amount of stable funding required to cover the funding risk linked to securities financing transactions, including the assets received or given in those transactions, and to unsecured transactions, with financial customers, where such transactions have a residual maturity of less than six months. The EBA shall report to the Commission by 31 January 2029, and every five years thereafter, on the appropriateness of that requirement. Taking into account international developments and the regulatory treatment of similar transactions in other jurisdictions, the reports shall assess at a minimum:’;  (b) point s (d) and (e) are replaced by the following :  ‘(d) the adequacy of the asymmetric treatment between liabilities with a residual maturity of less than six months provided by financial customers that are subject to a 0 % available stable funding factor in accordance with Article 428k(3) , point (c), and assets resulting from transactions with a residual maturity of less than six months with financial customers that are subject to a 0 %, 5 % or 10 % required stable funding factor in accordance with Article 428r(1), point (g), Article 428s(1) , point (b), and Article 428v , point (a) ;  (e) the impact of the introduction of higher or lower required stable funding factors for securities financing transactions, in particular with a residual maturity of less than six months , with financial customers, on:  (i) the price structure of those transactions ; and  (ii) the market liquidity of assets received as collateral in those transactions, in particular of sovereign and corporate bonds; ’ ;  (2) p aragraph s 7 and 8 are deleted .  Article 2 Entry into force and application  This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union .  This Regulation shall apply from 29 June 2025.  This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in the Member States in accordance with the Treaties.

FRAMEWORK OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE  1.1. Title of the proposal/initiative  Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions as regards requirements for securities financing transactions under the net stable funding ratio.  1.2. Policy area(s) concerned  Financial stability and financial services.  1.3. Objective(s)  1.3.1. General objective(s)  There are two general objectives: (i) maintain an adequate and efficient functioning of the SFT and collateral markets, in particular sovereign debt markets; and (ii) maintain an international level playing field, in line with the objectives of the Basel standards.  1.3.2. Specific objective(s)  Associated with the two general objectives are three specific objectives: (i) ensure that the liquidity and the cost structure of SFT and collateral markets remain appropriate; (ii) avoid an undue increase in funding costs for EU banks and Member States on short-term funding markets; and (ii) ensure the consistency of the required stable funding treatment in the EU with other large jurisdictions.  1.3.3. Expected result(s) and impact  Specify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.  The proposal contributes to: (i) ensuring adequate liquidity flows between banks and market players through collateralised transactions in the EU; (ii) maintaining the international level playing field for EU banks; and (iii) stabilising funding costs for EU banks and Member States.  1.3.4. Indicators of performance  Specify the indicators for monitoring progress and achievements.  The Commission proposes a mandate for the European Banking Authority to monitor, review and report to the Commission every five years, in particular on the impact of the proposed measure on the market liquidity of assets received as collateral in SFTs.  1.4. The proposal/initiative relates to:   a new action   a new action following a pilot project / preparatory action 16   the extension of an existing action   a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action  1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative  1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative  The initiative proposes to make the current treatment permanent for securities financing transactions and unsecured transactions with a residual maturity of less than six months, with financial customers. The current treatment is set to end on 28 June 2025. As such, it does not impose new requirements on EU banks. The entry into application of the proposed measure should be as close as possible to 28 June 2025.  1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, greater effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this section ‘ added value of EU involvement ’ is the value resulting from EU action, that is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.  Reasons for action at EU level ( ex-ante ) – Given that the proposed measure aims to amend existing EU legislation, it is best achieved at EU level rather than through different national initiatives. To achieve the EU single market’s objectives, it is crucial to ensure a standard application of the proposed measure, a convergence of related supervisory practices and a level playing field throughout the single market for banking services.  Expected generated EU added value ( ex post ) – Adopting national measures would be difficult from a legal standpoint given that the CRR is directly applicable and already regulates banking liquidity and funding prudential requirements at national level. In addition, a minimum degree of harmonisation and consistency across Member States is necessary to achieve the single market’s objectives.  1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past  The CRR is directly applicable across the EU and already regulates banking liquidity and funding prudential requirements in all Member States. This ensures a standard application of prudential measures, the necessary convergence in supervisory practices and a level playing field throughout the single market for banking services, forming the basis for sound competition across the EU.  1.5.4. Compatibility with the multiannual financial framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments  Not applicable for this proposal – no budgetary impact.  1.5.5. Assessment of the different available financing options, including scope for redeployment  Not applicable for this proposal – no budgetary impact.  1.6. Duration of the proposal/initiative and of its financial impact   limited duration  –  in effect from [DD/MM]YYYY to [DD/MM]YYYY  –  financial impact from YYYY to YYYY for commitment appropriations and from YYYY to YYYY for payment appropriations.   unlimited duration  – Implementation with a start-up period from YYYY to YYYY,  – followed by full-scale operation.  1.7. Method(s) of budget implementation planned 17   Direct management by the Commission  –  by its departments, including by its staff in the Union delegations;  –  by the executive agencies   Shared management with the Member States   Indirect management by entrusting budget implementation tasks to:  –  third countries or the bodies they have designated  –  international organisations and their agencies (to be specified)  –  the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund  –  bodies referred to in Articles 70 and 71 of the Financial Regulation  –  public law bodies  –  bodies governed by private law with a public service mission to the extent that they are provided with adequate financial guarantees  –  bodies governed by the private law of a Member State that are entrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership and that are provided with adequate financial guarantees  –  bodies or persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in the common foreign and security policy pursuant to Title V of the Treaty on European Union, and identified in the relevant basic act  –   bodies established in a Member State, governed by the private law of a Member State or Union law and eligible to be entrusted, in accordance with sector-specific rules, with the implementation of Union funds or budgetary guarantees, to the extent that such bodies are controlled by public law bodies or by bodies governed by private law with a public service mission, and are provided with adequate financial guarantees in the form of joint and several liability by the controlling bodies or equivalent financial guarantees and which may be, for each action, limited to the maximum amount of the Union support.

of 17 June 2025
amending Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 as regards requirements for securities financing transactions under the net stable funding ratio
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee(2),
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure(3),
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EU) 2019/876 of the European Parliament and of the Council(4)introduced into Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council(5)the net stable funding ratio (NSFR) requirement for credit institutions. That requirement reflected part of the Basel III standards agreed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), which were developed to ensure that credit institutions have sufficient stable funding on a one-year horizon, and thus to prevent an excessive maturity mismatch between assets and liabilities and an overreliance on short-term wholesale funding. The NSFR requirement has been applicable since 28 June 2021.
(2) Article 428r(1), point (g), Article 428s(1), point (b), and Article 428v, point (a), of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 currently provide for the stable funding factors for monies due from financing transactions with financial customers, where those transactions have a residual maturity of less than six months. Those funding factors are, depending on the financing transaction concerned, 0 %, 5 % or 10 %. However, Article 510(8) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 provides that, by 28 June 2025, those funding factors are to be raised to 10 %, 15 % and 15 %, respectively. That deferred raise aimed to give credit institutions sufficient time to gradually adapt to a more conservative calibration and to assess whether that calibration was appropriate. In addition to that deferred raise, other adjustments were adopted to ensure that the introduction of the NSFR requirement did not disrupt the liquidity of the related collateral markets, including sovereign bond markets.
(3) Under Article 510(6) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, the European Supervisory Authority (European Banking Authority) (EBA) established by Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council(6), was mandated to assess the appropriateness of the treatment of the stable funding required to cover the funding risk linked to securities financing transactions (SFTs) and to unsecured transactions with financial customers where those SFTs or unsecured transactions have a residual maturity of less than six months. In line with that mandate, EBA delivered a report on specific aspects of the NSFR framework on 16 January 2024. That report concluded that raising the required stable funding factors applying to the transactions referred to in Article 428r(1), point (g), Article 428s(1), point (b), and Article 428v, point (a), of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 would have a negligible impact on the NSFR levels of credit institutions. However, that report did not assess the broader dimension or spillover effects regarding the liquidity of the sovereign debt markets and the effects on sovereign bond markets. Therefore, the considerations justifying the deferral of the raising of required stable funding factors, as provided for in Article 510(8) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, continue to prevail. In particular, as the bulk of SFTs are collateralised by sovereign debt instruments, a raise in the related required stable funding could reduce the liquidity in the markets concerned. That could, in turn, risk creating additional funding costs for Member States and altering monetary policy transmission mechanisms.
(4) In addition, other BCBS member jurisdictions have set required stable funding factor levels for SFTs that are identical to those that are currently applicable under Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. In that context, given the intense international competition in the SFT market, raising the required stable funding factors by 28 June 2025 would create an uneven international playing field that would be detrimental to Union financial markets.
(5) To avoid those unintended consequences, the current stable funding factors for SFTs and for unsecured transactions with financial customers, where such transactions have a residual maturity of less than six months, should be made permanent.
(6) To ensure sufficient monitoring of interactions between the stable funding requirements and the market liquidity of assets received as collateral in SFTs and of unsecured transactions with financial customers, where such transactions have a residual maturity of less than six months, including when collateralised by sovereign debt, the funding risk for credit institutions, and possible international developments in that area, EBA should report to the Commission every five years on the appropriateness of those stable funding requirements.
(7) Temporarily discontinuing the prudential treatment for monies due from SFTs and for unsecured transactions with financial customers, with a residual maturity of less than six months, would create legal uncertainty for market participants and undue administrative and financial burden for the Union banking sector in general that could be mitigated by clearly setting the expected date of application of the provisions concerned. Therefore, to ensure the continuity of that prudential treatment, this amending Regulation should apply from 29 June 2025.
(8) Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 should therefore be amended accordingly,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  on the modification of customs duties applicable to imports of certain goods originating in or exported directly or indirectly from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus  EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM  1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  The purpose of the present proposal for a r egulation , in line with the European Council conclusions of 17 October 2024 1 , is to increase the customs duties applicable to imports of certain agricultural goods that are currently classified under Chapters 1, 2, 4 to 24, 29, 33, 35, 38, 41, 43, 50, 51, 52 and 53 of the Combined Nomenclature (CN) as well as of certain fertilisers currently classified under Chapter 31 of the CN, originating in or exported directly or indirectly from the Russian Federation or the Republic of Belarus. The proposal significantly and with immediate effect increases the applicable import tariffs for th e agricultural goods from the Russian Federation or the Republic of Belarus, while the tariff increases for the fertilisers will tak e place gradually , over a transition period of three years. In addition, those goods that originat e in or are exported directly or indirectly from the Russian Federation or the Republic of Belarus would be barred from access to the Union’s tariff rate quotas.  In 2023, Union imports of the agricultural goods from the Russian Federation covered by the proposed regulation (‘the concerned agricultural goods’) amounted to 2.9 million tonnes, with a value of EUR 380 million (according to Eurostat data). The Union’s erga omnes tariffs (i.e. the currently applied most-favoured-nation tariffs) on those concerned agricultural goods vary greatly. No trade is taking place in agricultural goods that already incur high most-favoured-nation tariffs. By contrast, agricultural goods from the Russian Federation that incur no or only relatively low most-favoured-nation tariffs are still being imported into the Union because there is no substantial most-favoured-nation tariff barrier to their entry into the Union’s market.  In 2023, the types of fertilisers covered by the proposed regulation (‘the concerned fertilisers’) represented over 70% of overall fertiliser consumption in the Union. According to Eurostat, imports from all third countries amounted to 14 million tonnes, and these included imports from the Russian Federation that amounted to 3.6 million tonnes (worth EUR 1.28 billion) – so over 25% of the Union’s total imports (by tonnage). Union producers meet the rest of the Union’s demand for these types of fertilisers, and the Union’s exports to the rest of the world of these products totalled 8 million tonnes in 2023. For all the concerned fertilisers, the Union’s erga omnes tariffs (i.e. the currently applied most-favoured-nation tariffs) are set at 6.5%, which is a low rate and not a significant hindrance to importing them from the Russian Federation into the Union.  The current importation of the concerned agricultural goods and fertilisers constitutes a dependency on the Russian Federation which could, if not addressed, impair the Union’s food security and, especially in the case of fertilisers, make the Union particularly vulnerable to potential coercive actions of the Russian Federation. Imports of the concerned fertilisers from the Russian Federation are already increasing and this increase could accelerate if significant volumes are re-oriented to the Union, given that the Russian Federation produces very large volumes of the concerned fertilisers. Such potential increased imports from the Russian Federation would disrupt the Union’s market in those goods and harm the Union’s nitrogen fertilisers producers who are facing difficulties to compete with imports from the Russian Federation at a time when gas prices in the Union remain high. The long-term survival of the Union’s nitrogen fertiliser industry is crucial for the Union’s food security because the fertilisers in question are essential for plant growth and play a critical role in maintaining the ability of the Union’s agricultural sector to produce food. Therefore, addressing the growing dependency on imports of the concerned fertilisers from the Russian Federation and preserving the viability of an autonomous Union nitrogen fertiliser industry is vital to ensuring and maintaining the Union’s food security. The present level of imports of the concerned agricultural goods is not comparable with that for the concerned fertilisers, but the current state of relations between the Union and the Russian Federation means that dependency should be prevented from developing in the future. However, it is not possible to ensure that this does not happen if the tariffs on concerned agricultural goods remain at present levels.  The proposed tariff measures would ensure that the Russian Federation does not benefit commercially from continuing to export to the Union. This would be consistent with the Union’s interests and with the Union’s law and policies, especially those applied towards the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus in the context of the Russian’s Federation’s unprovoked and unjustified aggression against Ukraine and the support which the Republic of Belarus continues to provide to thereof.  The Republic of Belarus exports limited quantities of the concerned agricultural goods and fertilisers (EUR 92 million of agricultural goods and EUR 29.6 million of fertilisers in 2023). It is therefore not an important producer or exporter of those goods. The scope of the proposed regulation nevertheless includes the Republic of Belarus due to its close political and economic ties to the Russian Federation and in order to prevent the illegal and fraudulent channelling of imports from the Russian Federation through the Republic of Belarus that could occur if the Union tariffs on imports of concerned goods originating in or imported from the Republic of Belarus were to remain unchanged. Given the continuing rapprochement and increasing trade between the Republic of Belarus and the Russian Federation, it is appropriate to treat the concerned goods from the Republic of Belarus in the same way as those from the Russian Federation.  The proposed regulation would increase tariffs for the concerned goods originating in or exported directly or indirectly from the Russian Federation or the Republic of Belarus to a level high enough to halt the importation of these goods. For all the concerned agricultural goods, tariffs on imports from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus to the Union would increase by an ad valorem duty of 50%. To avoid the entry of the concerned agricultural goods originating in or exported directly or indirectly from the Russian Federation or the Republic of Belarus into the Union market at the lower rates applicable under Union tariff rate quotas, it is also necessary to exclude goods originating in or exported directly or indirectly from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus from the application of reduced tariffs under those quotas. For the concerned fertilisers, on top of the existing ad valorem duty of 6.5%, the tariff would be subject to an additional specific duty that would gradually increase, starting at EUR 40 or EUR 45 per tonne, depending on the type of fertiliser (corresponding to approximately 13% in ad valorem equivalent), to a prohibitive level of EUR 315 or EUR 430 per tonne respectively, three years after the start of the proposed regulation’s application (a level of about 100% in ad valorem equivalent). Within the three-year transitional period, these prohibitive level tariffs will also be introduced in the event goods from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus are imported above certain specified volumes.  The proposed regulation is not expected to negatively affect global food security. Firstly, the increase in Union tariffs would apply only to imports into the Union and would therefore not affect the transit of the goods concerned from the Russian Federation or the Republic of Belarus through the Union territory to third countries. Secondly, the increase in the Union’s import duties is expected to substantially reduce the flows of these imports into the Union, thereby actually increasing the quantities of concerned goods available to third countries – and particularly to developing countries.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  The imposition of import tariff s on the goods concerned pertains to the Union’s Common Commercial Policy laid down in Article s 206 and 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union ( TFEU ) . It corresponds to ‘ change s in tariff rates ’ as provided for in Article 207(1) TFEU and builds on the option of denying most-favour ed -nation treatment to products originating in the Russian Federation that was reflected in the ‘ Joint Statement on Aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine with the support of Belarus ’ made by the Union and several other Members of the World Trade Organization in Geneva on 17 March 2022 2 . This h as already been put into practice in several regulations , including the regulation through which the Union has imposed higher tariff rates on imports of certain agricultural goods from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus 3 .  • Consistency with other Union policies  The proposed increases in customs duties on certain agricultural goods and fertilisers originating in or exported directly or indirectly from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus listed in this proposal would be consistent with the restrictive measures taken by the Union against these countries following the Russian Federation’s unprovoked and unjustified military aggression against Ukraine and the support which the Republic of Belarus continues to provide to the Russian Federation’s aggression. The tariffs increases in this proposed regulation would therefore comply with the requirement under Article 21(3) of the Treaty on European Union to ensure consistency between the different areas of the Union’s external action. They would also comply with Article 207(1) TFEU, which provides that the Common Commercial Policy is to be conducted in the context of the principles and objectives of the Union’s external actions.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  The legal basis for the proposal is Article 207(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  The Common Commercial Policy is, in accordance with Article 3(1)(e) of the TFEU, defined as an exclusive Union competence, so the subsidiarity principle does not apply.  • Proportionality  This proposed regulation is necessary in order to implement the Common Commercial Policy, with the objective of decreasing the Union’s imports from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus. This reduction is driven by concerns that these imports deepen the existing dependencies and therefore have a negative impact on the Union’s food security. The proposed regulation is consistent with the principle of proportionality and does not go beyond what is necessary in order to meet the objectives of the Treaties, in particular the need to ensure that the concerned agricultural goods and fertilisers originating in or exported directly or indirectly from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus do not disturb the Union market for those goods and the proper functioning of the Customs Union. Those goods should therefore not have access to the Union market on terms that are as favourable as the terms that apply to imports of such goods from other third countries. Proportionality is ensured by the fact that the proposed regulation would increase the Common Customs Tariff duties applicable to imports from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus and by the fact that this is necessary to limit such imports where the current tariffs are either set at zero or are low. The increase is necessary to reduce the ability of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus to weaponise their exports to the Union. The proposed increase of tariffs limits the exercise of certain fundamental rights, but does so only to the extent necessary to achieve its objectives.  • Choice of the instrument  This proposal is in accordance with Article 207(2) TFEU, which envisages Common Commercial Policy measures for enacting changes in tariff levels in the form of a regulation.  3. RESULTS OF EX POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex post evaluations / fitness checks of existing legislation  Not applicable.  • Stakeholder consultations  Not applicable.  • Collection and use of expertise  Not applicable.  • Impact assessment  In light of the current ability of the Russian Federation to use its export of certain agricultural goods and particularly the concerned fertilisers to destabilise the Union markets, negatively affect the Union’s food security and undermine the Union’s unity in supporting Ukraine; as well as in light of the Republic of Belarus’ support for the Russian Federation’s actions, it is important for the proposed regulation to enter into force urgently in order to increase as soon as possible the duty rates applicable to concerned goods from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus. No impact assessment has therefore been carried out for the proposed regulation. It is expected that the proposed measure will significantly reduce the importation into the Union of the concerned goods originating in or exported directly or indirectly from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus, and that this will result in further diversification of sourcing those goods away from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus.  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  The measure does not disproportionately increase the regulatory burden on companies and public authorities.  • Fundamental rights  The proposal is consistent with the Union’s human rights policy and with the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Where the imposition of import duties affects, in the Union, the freedom to engage in international trade as part of the freedom of professional activity, the right of property or other fundamental rights including equal treatment, this imposition can be considered a legitimate action by the Union that is in conformity with the Charter of Fundamental Rights. This is because this action is taken in conformity with the requirements for the action to be taken on the basis of a proper legal basis; by the competent authorities; and in pursuit of the legitimate objective of placing at a commercial disadvantage imports of certain goods from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus in order to foster diversification of supplies away from those two countries by promoting more Union domestic production and alternative imports from other third countries. The proposed regulation would also prevent serious disturbances of the relevant markets and weaponisation of exports of the concerned goods by the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus; and would ensure the proper functioning of the Union’s markets in a manner that would be consistent both with the Union’s current external action measures and with the principle of proportionality. Specifically, with regard to equal treatment, the fact that increased import duties are imposed on importers of certain agricultural goods and fertilisers originating in or exported directly or indirectly from the Russian Federation or the Republic of Belarus – but not on importers of goods that neither originate in nor are exported directly or indirectly from the Russian Federation or the Republic of Belarus – responds to one of the Union’s external action objectives. This is the Union’s legitimate policy objective of reducing such imports from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus, and of protecting the Union’s markets from an abuse of the trade in the concerned goods that is intended to destabilise the Union’s markets or the Union’s political stability and solidarity.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  The proposed regulation would have no financial impact on expenditure and only a very limited financial impact on revenue. Upon full application of the proposed regulation, the collection of increased customs duties corresponding to the proposed increases would be expected to be minimal (close to zero) because the proposed increase in duties is likely to reduce the import flows from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus to negligible volumes.  Conversely, some budget losses could be expected because the own resources generated for the Union’s budget would probably decrease. The exact value of the budget losses would depend on how the imports from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus would be replaced. On the one hand, replacing these imports by domestic production within the Union or by preferential imports (particularly of fertilisers from Algeria and Egypt) would result in a reduction of own resources. On the other hand, replacing them with increased imports from other third countries that are not preferential partners would not reduce own resources because these extra new imports would generate the same level of Common Customs Tariffs as the imports from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus that they would be replacing. Once the proposed regulation is fully in application, the effect on the Union budget’s traditional own resources is therefore estimated to be a loss of up to EUR 84 million (i.e. 75% of the total 2023 tariff revenue of EUR 112 million) in a scenario where all the existing Union imports from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus are replaced by the Union’s domestic production and preferential imports.  The loss of revenue in traditional own resources upon full application of the measure would be compensated by the Member States’ Gross National Income (GNI) based on resource contributions. However, it is expected that, during the first three years of application of the proposed measures, additional tariff revenues linked to higher tariffs on the remaining imports of nitrogen-based fertilisers from the Russian Federation or the Republic of Belarus would partially or possibly even fully offset the revenue losses associated with lower imported volumes. One could therefore expect that, during this initial three-year period, the net loss of revenue for these goods in traditional own resources would be close to zero.  The legislative financial statement sets out the budgetary implications of the proposed regulation in greater detail.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  On-line reporting on the development of Union imports of concerned agricultural goods and fertilisers originating in or exported directly or indirectly from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus is available on dedicated websites of the European Commission (Eurostat) 4 .  • Explanatory documents (for directives)  Not applicable.  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  The proposed regulation would prevent certain agricultural goods and fertilisers originating in or exported directly or indirectly from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus from accessing the Union market on terms that are as favourable as the terms that apply to imports of those goods from other origins. It would do so by raising import duties on all those goods – by an ad valorem duty of 50% for agricultural goods and by gradually increasing tariffs on fertilisers by a level starting at EUR 40 or EUR 45 per tonne (depending on the type of fertiliser) until the additional tariff reached the level of a prohibitive tariff of up to EUR 315 or 430 per tonne three years after the start of application of the restrictive measures. Within the three-year transitional period, these prohibitive level tariffs will also be introduced in the event goods from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus are imported above certain specified volumes. In addition, those goods that originate in or are exported directly or indirectly from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus would also be barred from benefiting from the Union’s tariff rate quotas for those goods. Those tariff rate quotas provide access to the Union market at a lower tariff level than the proposed new tariffs.  2025/0021 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  on the modification of customs duties applicable to imports of certain goods originating in or exported directly or indirectly from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 207 thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) The Union ’s imports of urea and nitrogen-based fertilisers from the Russia n Federation were significant at 3.6 million tonnes in 2023 and increased considerably in 2024 by compar ison with 2023 . The level of the Union ’s imports from the Russian Federation of the agricultural goods co vered by this Regulation (‘the concerned agricultural goods’) is relatively low for most goods , but could increas e significantly if the current trading conditions persist .  (2) The import s of the fertilisers covered by this Regulation (‘the concerned fertilisers’) currently reflect a situation of economic dependency on the Russian Federation . Moreover, the impor t s of the concerned agricultural goods could create a similar and additional economic dependency on the Russian Federation, which should in the present circumstances be prevented and reduced in order to protect the Union ’s markets and safeguard the Union ’s food security .  (3) The Union’s erga omnes common customs duties are the currently applied most-favoured-nation tariffs on imports of the concerned agricultural goods and fertilisers . T hey vary greatly at present . Depending on the good, some tariffs are either set at zero or are very low, while other tariffs are so high that no trade takes place.  (4) The continued importation of the agricultural goods and fertilisers covered by this Regulation from the Russian Federation under current conditions could mak e the Union vulnerable to coercive actions by the Russian Federation. In particular, a potential increase in the import ation of th e concerned goods from the Russian Federation could disrupt the Union’s market and negatively impact the Union’s producers. It is therefore necessary to take appropriate tariff measures in order to address the Union’s current and potential economic dependency on imports of those goods from the Russia n Federation . This should be done by ending the current situation where they enter the Union market on terms that are as favourable as those applied to goods from other origins that receive most-favoured-nation treatment .  (5) At present, imports of the concerned fertilisers from the Russian Federation are already increasing and could increase further and quickly if additional Russian production is re-oriented towards the Union . Such potential increased imports from the Russian Federation would disrupt the Union’s market for those goods and harm the Union’s nitrogen fertilisers producers , wh o are already facing difficulties in compet ing with imports from the Russia n Federation because gas prices in the Union remain high. The long-term survival of the Union ’ s nitrogen fertiliser industry is of crucial importance for the Union ’ s food security because the Union’s agricultural sector needs these fertilisers in order to produce food. A ddressing the growing dependency on imports of the concerned fertilisers from the Russian Federation and preserving the viability of an autonomous Union nitrogen fertiliser industry is therefore vital to ensuring and maintaining the Union ’ s food security. In order to prevent a future dependency on agricultural goods imports from the Russian Federation, it is also necessary to adjust the tariff levels for these products .  (6) The tariff measures should also be taken in respect of the Republic of Belarus in order to prevent potential imports to the Union from the Russian Federation from being diverted through the Republic of Belarus, given its close political and economic ties with the Russia n Federation . This could happen if the Union ’s tariffs on imports of goods from the Republic of Belarus were to remain unchanged.  (7) I mports of the concerned agricultural goods and fertilisers that originat e in or are exported directly or indirectly from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus should therefore be subject to higher customs duties than imports from other third countries.  (8) I mports from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus should not benefit from any lower tariffs under the Union’s tariff rate quotas , on terms of most-favoured-nation treatment. T he reduced rates set out in the Union’s tariff rate quotas for the goods listed in the Annex es I and II to this Regulation should therefore not apply to goods originating in or exported directly or indirectly from the Russian Federation or the Republic of Belarus to the Union.  (9) The envisaged increase in customs duties is not expected to negatively affect global food security because the increase in tariffs applies only to imports into the Union and does not affect goods concerned Regulation if they are only transiting through the Union ’s territory to third countries of final destination . T o the contrary, the envisaged increase in Union import duties may increase the exportation of those goods to third countries and increase the availability of supplies there .  (10) At the same time, fertilisers play a significant role for the food security as well as for the financial stability of the farmers in the Union. It is therefore necessary to ensure predictable and sufficient access to fertilisers, at affordable price levels for Union farmers, which should in turn contribute to the stabilisation of agricultural markets. During a transitional period, the proposed measure would stimulate stepping up the Union production and allow for reinforcing alternative sources of supply from other international partners, minimising the risk that fertilisers prices for Union farmers increase substantially. To this end, the Commission should monitor closely the evolution of fertiliser prices on the Union market. Should fertiliser prices substantially increase, the Commission should assess the situation and take all appropriate actions to remedy such surge .  (11) The envisaged increase in customs duties is consistent with the Union’s external action in other areas, as set out in Article 21 (3) of the Treaty on European Union. The state of relations between the Union and the Russian Federation has greatly deteriorated in recent years and particular ly since 2022 . This is due to the Russian Federation’s blatant disregard for international law and, in particular, its unprovoked and unjustified military aggression and full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Since July 2014, the Union has progressively imposed restrictive measures on trade with the Russian Federation in response to the Russian Federation ’s actions vis-à-vis Ukraine .  (12) T he Russian Federation is a Member of the World Trade Organization . However, the Union is currently allowed , by virtue of the exceptions that apply under the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization, and in particular Article XXI of the GATT 1994 (security exceptions ), to disregard the obligation to accord to goods imported from the Russian Federation the advantages granted to like similar products imported from other countries ( most-favoured-nation treatment) and is not prevented from ch arg ing import duties higher than those contained in the Union’s schedule of tariff commitments on trade in goods, if the Union considers such measures to be necessary in order to protect the Union’s essential security interests.  (13) The situation between the Union and the Republic of Belarus has also deteriorated in recent years due to the regime’s disregard for international law, fundamental freedoms and human rights , as well as its support for the Russian Federation’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Since October 2020, the Union has progressively imposed restrictive measures on trade with the Republic of Belarus.  (14) T he Republic of Belarus is not a Member of the World Trade Organization . T he Union is therefore not obliged, by virtue of the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization, to accord to goods from the Republic of Belarus most-favoured-nation treatment and other treatment in line with that A greement . In addition, existing trade agreements allow actions justified on the basis of applicable exception clauses, in particular security exceptions.  (15) This Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives pursued in accordance with Article 5(4) of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality , it is necessary and appropriate to lay down rules increasing tariffs on those goods with immediate effect , firstly in order to achieve the basic objective of ensuring that the concerned agricultural goods and fertilisers that originat e in or are exported directly or indirectly from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus do not disturb the Union’s market for those goods ; and secondly in order to implement the C ommon C ommercial P olicy and reduce the Union’s import s of these goods and fertilisers from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus in response to concerns that such imports c ould negatively affect the Union’s internal market and impair the Union’s food security ,  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Article 1  1. Goods classified in the Combined Nomenclature (CN) codes listed in Annex I that are imported into the Union and that originat e in or are exported directly or indirectly from the Russian Federation or the Republic of Belarus, shall be subject to an additional 50% ad valorem tariff customs duty that shall apply on top of the applicable Common Customs Tariff rate. Such goods originating in or exported directly or indirectly from the Russian Federation or the Republic of Belarus shall not be eligible for lower import duties for limited quantities (tariff rate quotas), as they apply , because they are either required by Union obligations under the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization, or opened by the Union without such obligation.  2. Goods classified in the tariff lines listed in Annex II that are imported into the Union and that originat e in or are exported directly or indirectly from the Russian Federation or the Republic of Belarus shall be subject to an import duty as follows:  (a) w ith regard to the goods falling under CN code 3102:  (i) 6.5% ad valorem + 40 EUR/tonne from 1 July 2025 until 30 June 2026 ;  (ii) 6.5% ad valorem + 60 EUR/tonne from 1 July 202 6 until 30 June 202 7 ;  (iii) 6.5% ad valorem + 80 EUR/tonne from 1 July 202 7 until 30 June 202 8;  (iv) 6.5% ad valorem + 315 EUR/tonne from 1 July 2028 .  (b) w ith regard to the goods falling under CN codes 3105 20, 3105 30, 3105 40, 3105 51, 3105 59 and 3105 90:  (i) 6.5% ad valorem + 45 EUR/tonne from 1 July 2025 until 30 June 2026 ;  (ii) 6.5% ad valorem + 70 EUR/tonne from 1 July 2026 until 30 June 2027 ;  (iii) 6.5% ad valorem + 95 EUR/tonne from 1 July 2027 until 30 June 202 8;  (iv) 6.5% ad valorem + 430 EUR/tonne from 1 July 2028.  (c) Notwithstanding points (a) and (b), if cumulative import volumes of goods listed in points (a) and (b) reach the thresholds set below, the Commission shall, within 21 days, impose a duty at the level defined under point (a)(iv) or (b)(iv) respectively, for the remaining imports of these goods in the given period:  (i) 2.7 million tonnes from 1 July 2025 until 30 June 2026 ;  (ii) 1.8 million tonnes from 1 July 2026 until 30 June 2027 ;  (iii) 0.9 million tonnes from 1 July 2027 until 3 0 June 2028.  (d) The Commission may adopt an implementing act laying down the arrangements for monitoring the import volumes referred to in paragraph 2. That implementing act shall be adopted in accordance with the advisory procedure set out in Article 4 of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011.  Article 2  1. The Commission shall monitor prices applicable in the Union of the goods listed in Annex II during four years from the application of this Regulation .  2. Should the price levels of the goods listed in Annex II substantially exceed the levels of 2024 in the period referred to in paragraph 1, the Commission shall assess the situation and take all appropriate action s to remedy such surge. This may include, if appropriate, proposing the temporary suspension of tariffs for concerned goods imported from origins other than the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus .  Article 3  This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union . It shall apply from four weeks after its entry into force in respect of the goods listed in Annex I.  This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.  Done at Brussels,  For the European Parliament For the Council  The President The President  LEGISLATIVE FINANCIAL STATEMENT  NAME OF THE PROPOSAL:  Proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the modification of customs duties applicable to imports of certain goods originating in or exported directly or indirectly from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus  BUDGET LINES:  Chapter and article: Chapter 12, Article 120.  Amount budgeted for 2024: EUR 24 620 400 000.  FINANCIAL IMPACT:  ◻ Proposal has no financial implications  X Proposal has no financial impact on expenditure but has a financial impact on the traditional own resources revenue for the following reasons .  In 2023, the total value of the Union’s imports from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus of CN codes within the scope of this proposed regulation and subject to the proposed increase was over EUR 1.69 billion. Of this total, imports of agricultural goods were EUR 380 million and imports of fertilisers were EUR 1.31 billion.  Imports of concerned fertilisers from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus are currently subject to a 6.5% ad valorem tariff. Most of the 2023 fertiliser imports (EUR 516 million) took place under CN code 3102 10 10. Significant imports also took place under CN codes 3105 30 00 (EUR 179 million), 3105 20 10 (EUR 151 million), 3105 40 00 (EUR 91 million) and 3 105 59 00 (EUR 89 million). The overall tariff revenue for the Union from fertiliser imports from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus was EUR 85.2 million, before deduction of collection costs by Member States.  Imports of the concerned agricultural products are subject to varying duties. In 2023 the overall tariff revenue for the Union from imports of those goods from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus was EUR 27 million, before deduction of collection costs by Member States. For these agricultural goods, the increase of tariffs by this proposed regulation is expected to considerably decrease or even stop these trade flows. The collection of increased customs duties corresponding to the proposed increases on agricultural goods is expected to be minimal (close to zero), because trade flows are expected to cease due to the increase in tariff levels.  The collection of increased customs duties corresponding to the proposed increases on fertilisers is expected to cease when the proposed regulation enters into full application upon the end of the three-year transition period, because trade flows are expected to cease due to the increase in tariff levels. These trade flows and associated customs duties are nevertheless expected to remain substantial during the transition period.  On the basis of the abovementioned factors, the impact on the loss of revenue for the Union budget resulting from this proposed regulation is estimated at a maximum of EUR 84 million per year as from the financial year 2029: [(EUR 85.2 million + EUR 27 million) = EUR 112.2 million gross amount, including collection costs] x 0.75.  For 2025, 2026, 2027 and 2028, the impact of the loss of traditional own resources revenue for the Union budget is estimated to be much lower than the amount calculated for 2028. This is because increased duties on fertilisers are expected to bring additional tariff revenues of EUR 77 million per 12-month period (after deduction of collection costs), contributing to an increase of own resources of EUR 58 million. The net reduction of own resources is therefore expected to be no higher than EUR 26 million in the first 12-month period of the application (1 July 2025 – 30 June 2026), corresponding to EUR 14 million for the remaining of the year 2025. It is even possible that own resources may increase if the reduction of imports from the Russian Federation is partially matched by imports from other third countries that do not benefit from tariff preferences under the Union’s free trade agreements.  The loss of revenue in traditional own resources will be compensated by Member States’ Gross National Income (GNI) based on resource contributions.

final  2025/0084(COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulations (EU) 2021/1058 and (EU) 2021/1056 as regards specific measures to address strategic challenges in the context of the mid-term review  EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM  1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  The mid-term review of cohesion policy presents an opportunity for Member States to redirect 2021-2027 resources towards investment in defence capabilities and for the competitiveness and strategic autonomy of the EU and in other emerging priorities, including clean industrial deal objectives by submitting corresponding programme amendments to the Commission. However, the framework for cohesion policy investments set out in the ERDF, Cohesion Fund and JTF regulations is not sufficiently aligned with these new priorities. Furthermore, additional flexibility is required to accelerate investment in these areas, notably to reinforce the resilience of the EU economy and all its regions at a critical geopolitical juncture such as the one the EU is currently facing. This proposal sets out a number of adjustments to these regulations to achieve these objectives.  Aligning cohesion policy investments to new priorities  In recent years, geopolitical dynamics have been marked by profound uncertainty, necessitating a fundamental re-evaluation of the EU’s strategic autonomy, resilience and preparedness. These shifts are unfolding alongside the green, social and technological transitions, which are rapidly reshaping the world around us. The challenges posed by these simultaneous transformations were comprehensively analysed in the report on the “Future of European Competitiveness”, published in September 2024. The report underscores the urgent need to close the innovation gap, accelerate decarbonisation efforts to strengthen economic competitiveness, and reduce external dependencies by diversifying supply chains and scaling-up domestically produced green energy investing in climate resilience, digitalisation and critical sectors.  In response, several major initiatives have already been launched to enhance the EU’s economic resilience and strategic autonomy. These include the “Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform” (STEP), which aims to strengthen Europe’s technological leadership; “REPowerEU”, designed to reduce reliance on external energy sources and accelerate the green transition, to complete interventions already underway via cohesion policy programmes and the “Recovery and Resilience Facility” (RRF), to support structural changes in Member States and regions as well as to enhance their resilience.  As the EU’s main investment instrument within the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), cohesion policy plays a crucial role in supporting these priorities. It drives targeted investments that contribute to economic, social and territorial cohesion while at the same time addressing emerging challenges. However, the regulatory framework governing the 2021-2027 cohesion policy funds was drafted, negotiated and adopted before the series of major geopolitical and economic events that have since reshaped some of the EU’s strategic political priorities.  Similarly, the Partnership Agreements and the national and regional cohesion policy programmes were developed and approved within this same timeframe, hence reflecting the priorities set at the time. Given the evolving global and regional context, the 2025 mid-term review presents a critical opportunity to assess their implementation and the effectiveness of their contribution to the evolving priorities. This review will help determine the extent to which cohesion policy programmes can directly and swiftly respond to rapidly changing political, economic and social realities.  At the same time, it has become evident that the early implementation of the 2021-2027 cohesion policy programmes has faced challenges which have not been conducive to a swift uptake and rapid disbursement of the funds, leading to delays in their implementation compared to previous programming periods. These delays come at a time when strong and accelerated investment is essential to support economic resilience and competitiveness.  · Against this backdrop, the Commission is proposing targeted amendments to Regulations (EU) 2021/1056 and (EU) 2021/1058. These changes aim to adjust investment priorities with the evolving economic, societal, and geopolitical context , as well as with our climate and environment objectives, while at the same time introducing greater flexibility and incentives to facilitate and encourage the rapid deployment of much-needed resources. By refining the 2021-2027 cohesion policy framework, the EU can ensure that its investment mechanisms remain agile and responsive, enabling a more effective response to current and future challenges.  · In order for Member States to make effectively use of the possibilities provided in this proposal, the Commission proposes that they be allowed to re-submit their mid-term review proposal by 2 months after the entry into force of the present proposal for amendment to Regulation (EU) 2021/1058 . Any programme amendment that would be carried out pursuant to the new priorities and flexibilities, shall be without prejudice to the application of any measures adopted under Regulation (EU) 2020/2092 and to the compliance by relevant programmes with the priorities under Article 15 of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060. In this context the Commission will closely monitor the conformity of the programmes with the requirements of relevant EU law.  Competitiveness and decarbonisation  The Commission presented in the Competitiveness Compass, the Clean Industrial Deal and the Affordable Energy Action Plan a concrete path for Europe to regain its competitiveness and secure sustainable prosperity, with decarbonisation and circularity as drivers of growth.  In particular, energy intensive industries play a critical role in our regions and require special attention as part of the reprogramming of EU funds.  These industries face significant challenges, including higher energy costs compared to their global competitors, the continued lack of competitiveness of certain clean technologies, a slow-down in demand in some of the main downstream sectors, increased international competition driven by overcapacities and subsidised production in non-EU countries As a result, these factors undermine the competitiveness of energy intensive industries and weaken Europe’s decarbonisation and resilience objectives.  The cohesion funds can already support investments to climate objectives as laid down in Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 but efforts should be further accelerated in order to ensure that decarbonisation is a driver for growth for European industries and the prosperity of Europeans. In light of the significant investment needs to achieve our decarbonisation and competitiveness objectives, Member States need to continue investing in projects directly contributing to the climate and energy transition in line with the requirements set out in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 which will continue to apply to maintain the level of climate related investments.  Support for projects within the scope of STEP should be made possible in all regions, including in the more developed regions in Member States of the Union with GDP per head above the EU average to the extent it is allowed by State aid rules as set out in Articles 107 and 108 of the Treaty , in particular to the extent such investments contribute to the Union’s strategic objectives as set out in the applicable guidelines such as the future Clean Industrial State aid Framework (currently in public consultation) and in the IPCEI Communication 1 .  Furthermore, other restrictions linked to STEP as regards the ceiling set at 20% of the ERDF allocation for reprogramming should be removed and the deadline for submitting STEP amendments and benefit from the additional one-off prefinancing deleted. This should also help in promoting investments in innovative clean technologies (manufacturing capacities and deployment) that are essential to deliver on the objectives of the Clean Industrial Deal and also in other important support areas for which STEP provides important incentives.  It is important to recognise and strengthen the role also of large enterprises in regional development, as they steer research, innovation, knowledge, and technology transfer towards other companies and create demand and employment throughout the supply chain. With the objective to maximise the impact of EU support to boost growth and competitiveness, the Commission also proposes to expand the possibilities to provide support for productive investments in enterprises other than SMEs under the ERDF in cases where the financial resources are used for (1) supporting investments contributing to the STEP objectives, (2) enhancing the industrial capacities to foster defence capabilities, (3) contributing to  a defence projects and (4) facilitating industrial adjustment linked to the decarbonisation and support to circular processes of production processes and products, such as in the automotive and energy intensive industries, to the extent allowed by State aid rules . Investments in projects directly participating in an IPCEI as approved by the Commission pursuant to Article 107(3), point (b) TFEU, and to Communication C(2021) 8481, in enterprises other than SMEs may also be supported. Support for such enterprises needs to be further facilitated under the Just Transition Fund as well by not requiring a gap analysis. Therefore, it is proposed that Member States are allowed, in line with State aid rules, to directly grant support from ERDF to projects directly participating in an Important Project of Common European Interest approved by the Commission pursuant to Article 107(3), point (b), of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and to Communication C(2021) 8481 .  To further enhance the leverage of InvestEU, the EU flagship programme to boost investments in strategic and critical industries, and further the transfer possibilities already provided by the legislation, the Commission proposes to make possible the transfer of resources from the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund to InvestEU Member State compartments for implementing a new InvestEU financial instrument for the achievement of cohesion policy objectives.  Defence and security  In the face of unprecedented geopolitical instability in decades, the European Union must now make crucial decisions to ensure its readiness and security. To guarantee its own defence deterrence, Europe must be prepared to enter a new era by significantly increasing its support for the development of the defence capabilities, reduced dependencies, infrastructure resilience and the competitiveness of the EU defence industry. This effort will enable the Union to address the short-term urgency of supporting Ukraine while ensuring the continent’s long-term stability.  The Commission has proposed to the European Council an immediate response plan — REARM Europe — amounting to EUR 800 billion, by activating all available financial levers to swiftly and significantly support investment in European defence capacities. Among these levers, the Union budget can further contribute to this collective effort through a new dedicated defence instrument and the strengthening of the European Defence Industry Programme (EDIP).  To complement these tools and further incentivise Member States to directly support defence investments, it is essential that cohesion policy funding can be swiftly mobilised. These investments will reinforce the resilience and EU competitiveness while promoting regional development and growth. They will also tackle the dual challenge faced by the Union’s regions bordering Russia, Belarus and Ukraine: strengthening security while revitalising their economies.  In order to provide for a framework that allows for flexibility and financial support, the Commission proposes to create two new specific objectives within the existing scope of the ERDF support. The first new specific objective allows Member States to reprogramme under their 2021-2027 programmes under the Investments for jobs and growth goal amounts for enhancing productive capacities in enterprises in the defence sector without restriction in terms of geography or size of the enterprise. Productive investments in enterprises other than SMEs and made in all EU regions should also be able to access financial support for defence industry projects of common interest under EDIP and reinforce Europe’s overall defence and preparedness capacities. The second new specific objective related to defence contributes to building resilient defence or dual use infrastructure to foster military mobility in the EU. These specific objectives also help eastern border regions.  It is proposed that Member States, when using the proposed framework, benefit from an additional one-off pre-financing of 30% of the amounts programmed under the dedicated priority and the possibility to apply a Union financing of up to 100% regarding both specific objectives – provided that the programme amendment is submitted in 2025.  Affordable housing (including social housing)  Housing prices and rents have increased significantly over the past years. At the same time, wages have not increased at a similar pace. This uneven evolution has created a widening gap between the availability of affordable housing and the needs of the population.  The average house prices declined after 2008 following the economic recession but have consistently risen throughout the EU since 2013. In total, there was an increase of 59% in the EU between 2013 and the third quarter of 2024, which is about twice the increase in the overall price level (HICP) in the same period.  The escalation of house price growth has not been matched by a corresponding rise in wages, leading to considerable pressure on housing affordability. The price-to-income ratio increased by more than 15pp between 2013 and 2022, and despite some respite in 2023 it is still above its long-term average.  While the issue varies in severity from country to country and region to region, its impact is widespread. High housing costs force many households to allocate a disproportionate share of their income to rent or mortgages, leaving less for other necessities like food, healthcare and education – with a risk of falling into poverty. In 2023, one out of three households that are at risk of poverty spend 40% or more of the household disposable income on housing. House prices differ also between urban and non-urban areas. Housing prices as a proportion of income are higher and have been steadily increasing since 2015 in metropolitan and other urban areas, while they remained stable in other areas. The social impact of these figures is wider if we consider that they include the lack of students housing and of adequate lodgements for prospective new families .  The lack of sufficient affordable housing puts an increasing number of households under severe difficulties, but it also has a competitiveness angle. Indeed, European companies in some areas start to have problems to attract workers because the costs of housing and living in those areas are disproportionately high as compared to income. High prices are also putting public services in certain cities under pressure due to difficulties in attracting essential public workers (teachers, nurses, police, etc.).  Against this background, the political guidelines of the Commission give housing policy strong emphasis by proposing a coordinated approach under the upcoming European ‘Affordable Housing Plan’. As part of this overarching ambition, the Commission now proposes to address the growing investment gap in affordable housing by allowing Member States to reprogramme under their 2021-2027 programmes amounts for supporting investments that promote access to affordable housing. Investments under the New European Bauhaus should make full use of these new possibilities provided.  At the same time, it must be ensured that housing is climate resilient.  The Commission proposes to include corresponding additional specific objectives under three policy objectives thus allowing flexibility for Member States and regions depending on their programming structures and the focus of the housing interventions.  In order to incentivise reprioritising their programmes and uptake, and without prejudice to compliance with State aid rules, it is proposed that Member States, when using the proposed framework, benefit from a 100% Union financing and a pre-financing of 30% of the amounts programmed under the dedicated priority. With a view to enhancing the impact of investments, the scope of interventions now allows to include actions linked to implementing reforms under cohesion policy, provided that the programme amendment is submitted in 2025.  Access to water, sustainable water management and water resilience  Water is a vital resource for the security of our food, energy and economic systems, yet both at EU and global level water resources are facing mounting pressures. Effective water management is essential for safeguarding public health, protecting the environment, and maintaining the EU’s economic competitiveness. Mismanagement, including over-abstraction and pollution, is increasingly constraining critical sectors such as agriculture, energy, manufacturing, and transport. The EU is faced with increasing impacts from climate change which exacerbate the existing pressures on water quality, water quantity and marine ecosystems.  In this context, it is urgent to enhance implementation of the water and marine protection legislation and improve water efficiency, address water scarcity, and progress towards a water resilient Europe, requiring significant efforts and investments. The EU water sector and blue economy sector are significant economic sectors in many regions, driving innovation, and safeguarding public health, and sustainability, e.g. by offering advanced solutions such as desalination, water treatment, water reuse, blue biotechnology etc. The global leadership in water technologies enhances the EU’s export potential and creates jobs in all regions across Europe.  The EU therefore must protect these water ecosystems and infrastructures by scaling up investments and consider water supply and infrastructure through the lens of ensuring access to and supply of water to our citizens and societies in all circumstances.  The EU has established a strong legal framework for the sustainable and secure management of water, but further progress in implementation is essential and more decisive action is urgently needed. For that reason, the EU will come forward with an EU Water Resilience Strategy in the first half of 2025. In line with the Preparedness Union Strategy, water resilience requires a shift from reactive crisis management to proactive, risk-based management and increased preparedness.  In the 2021-2027 period, almost EUR 13 billion are being invested in water services and improved wastewater collection and treatment in cohesion policy programmes. But additional efforts from the public and private sectors are needed to ensure sufficient progress Therefore, to properly emphasise the importance and focus of investments in water resilience, the Commission proposes to modify the wording of the specific objective related to water management under policy objective 2 “A greener, low-carbon transitioning towards a net zero carbon economy and resilient Europe by promoting clean and fair energy transition, green and blue investment, the circular economy, climate change mitigation and adaptation, risk prevention and management, and sustainable urban mobility”.  Cohesion policy investments in sustainable and secure investments should be incentivised, notably to contribute to build a water resilient society, through increased restoration of water bodies, deployment of nature-based solutions to reduce floods risk and increase the capacity of ecosystems to store water, improved control of water abstractions and increased water efficiency and reuse increased digitisation of water infrastructure, mitigation of drought and desertification impacts, flooding and extreme weather events, and compliance with the Water Framework, the Groundwater, the Urban Wastewater Treatment, and the Environmental Quality Standards Directives. It is proposed that Member States, when using the proposed framework, benefit from the possibility of a Union financing up to 100% and a pre-financing of 30% of the amounts programmed under the dedicated priority for this new specific objective.  Energy transition  Another area where cohesion policy investments contribute to EU priorities is climate action and climate transition, where the policy invests more than EUR 110 billion. In light of the significant investment needs of the climate transition, Member States need to maintain their efforts to respect the funds’ climate ambition.  In order to enhance energy security and accelerate the transition across the Union and also to promote clean mobility, a new specific objective should be created to promote energy interconnectors and related transmission infrastructure, and the deployment of recharging infrastructure from ERDF and Cohesion Fund resources.  In order to accelerate the energy transition of industry, notably in energy-intensive sectors, that is necessary for reaching the EU climate objectives and for the EU’s competitiveness and resilience, the Commission proposes to enlarge the scope of support from the ERDF to decarbonisation of projects selected in the context of Union instruments in particular projects in installations that have been awarded a ‘Sovereignty Seal’ under the Innovation Fund established by the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), and to reduce administrative checks for similar support under the JTF.  To increase climate resilience is essential to ensure competitiveness. In line with the Preparedness Union Strategy and the concept of preparedness and security by design, it is vital to ensure sustainable and informed investments, based on proper climate modelling data, so as to protect both vulnerable populations and the EU economy and competitiveness.  Eastern border regions  Given the challenges of the eastern border regions since the Russian aggression against Ukraine, programmes under the Investment for jobs and growth goal with NUTS 2 regions that have borders with Russia, Belarus or Ukraine, should benefit from the possibility of a one-off 9.5% pre-financing of the programme allocation and a 100% Union financing.  Greater flexibility and simplification for accelerating investments  Halfway through the 2021-2027 programming period, the level of payments claimed by the Member States to the Commission is low, owing to a combination of factors: the late adoption of the regulations governing the policy; the need to face successive crises from the COVID-19 pandemic to the war against Ukraine, and to the energy crisis; the pressure to close the previous programming period; and the priority given to implement the instruments of NGEU, given their shorter implementation timeframe. All this has in turn put a strain on the administrative capacities of Member States’ authorities to design and quickly deliver investments. Notwithstanding a rapid acceleration experienced over last year with project selection close to 40% of the allocations, cohesion policy implementation should rapidly pick up pace in a context where the Union is facing a range of new challenges requiring rapid responses. The Commission therefore proposes a set of measures aiming at further enhancing the flexibility and simplification of the use of cohesion policy support for accelerating investments:  – To avoid that programme implementation is delayed because of national budgetary constraints, and to expand the financial capacity of Member States to address the newly emerging challenges, the Commission proposes to provide a one-off 4.5% pre-financing provided from the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund in 2026 to all programmes that reallocate at least 15% of their resources for the new priorities in the context of the mid-term review process . The pre-financing percentage is proposed to be increased to 9.5% in 2026 for programmes under the Investment for jobs and growth goal covering one or more NUTS2 regions bordering Russia, Belarus or Ukraine. To avoid that the risk of delays and corresponding loss of funds reduces willingness to undertake programme amendments and to ensure the proper implementation of the operations concerned, the Commission proposes to extend the time limit for using the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund resources and extend the end date for eligibility by an additional year. This flexibility is proposed to be made available only for programmes that proposed amendments resulting in reallocation of at least 15% of the resources for the new priorities set out in the present proposal and in the context of the mid-term review exercise, once approved.  – Costs related to preparatory actions for reforms will be eligible including for self-standing reforms (i.e. not accompanied by investments).  – To further enhance synergies among EU policies and instruments, it is proposed that the JTF is also covered by the Seal of Excellence ( including the Sovereignty Seal) mechanism and the possibility for a simplified selection procedure under Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 thus providing support to projects selected under other EU instruments, which do not have sufficient funding. In light of the high demand for the Innovation Fund and its track record in supporting projects that are sufficiently mature and have a significant potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and that either demonstrate highly innovative technologies, processes or products, or are aimed at scaling up innovative technologies, processes or products to achieve their broad commercial roll-out across the EU, t he Commission also proposes to align with the possibilities for projects support ed under the Innovation Fund and include a corresponding targeted provision allowing for the production, processing, transport, distribution, storage or combustion of fossil fuels provided these projects were attributed a Sovereignty Seal under the Innovation Fund.  – Recognising the important role of cities in delivering EU objectives, in addressing local challenges and in strengthening the urban-rural links to drive a balanced regional development, the Commission proposes to reinforce the European Urban Initiative (EUI) by introducing the possibility of reallocating resources from the ERDF to the EUI. Such amounts would support actions for the benefit of Member States initiating the reallocation. The Commission also proposes to establish a Seal of Excellence for the EUI, thus enabling support under cohesion policy programmes for EUI projects that have been selected but could not receive funding due to insufficient resources. Member States would also have the possibility to reallocate ERDF resources from their programmes under the Investment for j obs and g rowth goal to the Interregional Innovation Investment Instrument thus having more flexibility in the use of resources. These reallocations are taking place within the same fund, the ERDF, and therefore it is proposed not to count them towards the ceilings set out in Article 26 of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060.  With the objective of easing the successful and effective implementation of the JTF, the Commission proposes to remove the current restrictions applicable to the modification of indicator targets in the Just Transition Plans after their amendment following the mid-term review. These restrictions can be removed only if they do not affect the transition to climate neutrality and fossil fuel phase out commitments.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  The proposal is consistent with the objectives followed by the cohesion policy funds and is limited to a targeted amendment of Regulation (EU) 2021/1058 and Regulation (EU) 2021/1056.  • Consistency with other Union policies  The proposal is limited to a targeted amendment of Regulation (EU) 2021/1058 and Regulation (EU) 2021/1056 and maintains consistency with other Union policies.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  The proposal is based on Articles, 175, 177,178 and 322 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  To encourage Member States to better align their cohesion policy programmes with emerging EU priorities while ensuring greater flexibility and simplification to accelerate investments, amendments to Regulation (EU) 2021/1058 and Regulation (EU) 2021/1056 are proposed. The same result cannot be achieved through actions at national level.  • Proportionality  The proposal aims at incentivising Member States to further align their cohesion policy programmes towards the emerging EU priorities and providing greater flexibility and simplification for accelerating investments. The measures do not go beyond what is necessary to achieve these goals.  • Choice of the instrument  A Regulation is the appropriate instrument as it provides directly applicable rules for the support.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  N/A  • Stakeholder consultations  N/A  • Collection and use of expertise  N/A  • Impact assessment  An impact assessment has been carried out to prepare the proposal for Regulation (EU) 2021/1058 and Regulation (EU) 2021/1056. The limited and targeted changes do not require a separate impact assessment.  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  N/A  • Fundamental rights  N/A  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  The proposal concerns cohesion policy programmes under the 2021-2027 period and will result in additional pre-financing to be paid under the ERDF in 2026. This additional pre-financing will lead to frontloading of payment appropriations to 2026 compared to a no policy-change scenario and is budgetary neutral over the 2021-2027 period. Based on the estimated uptake of the proposal, the total additional pre-financing to be paid in 2026 amounts to EUR 16.1 billion. At the same time, taking into account payment forecasts and implementation shifts, the net budgetary impact is estimated at EUR 3.6 billion, which will be included in the draft budget 2026. The possibility to apply for an increased Union financing rate for investments in defence, housing, water resilience, certain energy infrastructure and for programmes covering eastern border regions will also lead to a partial front-loading of payments, followed by lower payments at a later stage as the overall envelope is unchanged. The actual budgetary impact of the increased co-financing rate on an annual basis will depend on the Member States’ uptake and the pace of submission of payment applications.  The proposed modification does not require changes in the Multiannual Financial Framework annual ceilings for commitments and payments as per Annex I to Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2020/2093.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  The implementation of the measure will be monitored and reported upon in the framework of the general reporting mechanisms established in Regulation (EU) 2021/1060.  • Explanatory documents (for directives)  N/A  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  The proposal involves the amendment of Regulations (EU) 2021/1058 and (EU) 2021/1056 as regards the ERDF, the Cohesion Fund and the JTF:  Specific objectives  Competitiveness and decarbonisation  · The 20% limitation set on reprogramming resources to the STEP specific objectives is removed.  · Support from the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund to enterprises other than SMEs is made possible, to the extent they comply with State aid rules as set out in Articles 107 and 108 of the Treaty , for investments that participate in an Important Project of Common European Interest approved by the Commission pursuant to Article 107(3), point (b), of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), and to Communication C ( 2021 ) 8481, or where the enterprises facilitate industrial adjustment linked to the decarbonisation of production processes and products . In addition, the possibility to support large enterprises is extended to all regions in the context of the STEP specific objectives under policy objectives 1 and 2 , to the extent this is allowed under State aid rules ;  · The possibility for Member States to transfer resources from the ERDF or the Cohesion Fund to the Member State compartment of the InvestEU Fund for the deployment in the new Invest EU financial instrument, as included in the proposal for amendment of the InvestEU Regulation (COM(2025) 84);  · For Important Projects of Common European Interest that have been approved by the Commission pursuant to Article 107(3), point (b), of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and to Communication C ( 2021 ) 8481 , the selection process is simplified as the managing authorities are able, in line with State aid rules, to directly grant support from the ERDF for projects directly participating in such an approved Important Project of Common European Interest .  · Ensuring that investments with cohesion funding increase climate resilience , as it is also an essential part of ensuring competitiveness.  Defence and security  · A new specific objective is introduced under policy objective 1 for the ERDF and under policy objective 3 for the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund in support of investments in the EU’s defence capability and the scope of support is amended to allow for support to enterprises other than SMEs for these specific objectives , to the extent allowed under State aid rules . The specific objective under policy objective 3 will promote resilient defence or dual use infrastructure to foster military mobility in the Union. Furthermore, the Commission will pay, in addition to the yearly pre-financing for the programmes, 30% exceptional one-off pre-financing based on the resources allocated to these specific objectives in dedicated priorities and the maximum co-financing rate for these priorities is set at 100%.  Affordable housing (including social housing)  · To promote investments in affordable housing, including social housing and support to related reforms, three new specific objectives are introduced for the ERDF and one for the Cohesion Fund. For these specific objectives, the Commission will pay, in addition to the yearly pre-financing for the programmes, 30% exceptional one-off pre-financing based on the resources allocated to dedicated priorities and the maximum co-financing rate for dedicated priorities supporting these objectives is 100% . At the same time, it must be ensured that housing is climate resilient.  · Furthermore, the scope of the Just Transition Fund is amended to allow for investments in affordable housing and support for relevant reforms also to take place in support of the implementation of the territorial just transition plans.  Secure access to water, sustainable water management and water resilience  · The amendment of the specific objective into ‘promoting secure access to water , sustainable water management and water resilience ’ reflect s the strategic importance for the EU of resilient water management. To help accelerate investments in this area, the Commission will pay, in addition to the yearly pre-financing for the programmes, 30% exceptional one-off pre-financing based on the resources allocated to dedicated priorities supporting the specific objective and the maximum co-financing rate for dedicated priorities supporting these objectives is 100% .  Energy transition  · In order to enhance energy security and accelerate the transition across the Union and also to promote clean mobility, a new specific objective should be created to promote energy interconnectors and related transmission infrastructure, and the deployment of recharging infrastructure from ERDF and Cohesion Fund resources.  Eastern border regions  · Given the challenges of the e astern border regions since Russia ’s war of aggression against Ukraine, programmes under the Investment for jobs and growth goal - financed by the ERDF or the Cohesion Fund with NUTS 2 regions that have borders with Russia, Belarus or Ukraine - should benefit from the possibility of a one-off 9.5% pre-financing and a 100% Union financing , if programmes reallocate at least 15% of their resources for the newly introduced specific objectives and STEP . Where the corresponding programme covers the entire territory of the Member State, these financial flexibilities should only apply if the programme covering the entire territory of the Member State is the only programme in the Member State that includes the concerned NUTS 2 regions.  Cities  · The European Urban Initiative is strengthened by allowing the attribution of a Seal of Excellence for innovative actions that were assessed and comply with the minimum quality requirements but could not be financed due to budgetary constraints and by allowing Member States to allocate part of their initial national allocation of the ERDF to the European Urban Initiative. This reallocation would not count towards the ceilings set out in Article 26 of Regulation (EU) 2021 / 1060.  Further flexibilities on implementation  Thematic concentration  · The ERDF thematic concentration requirements are revised to accommodate the introduction of the new and amended specific objectives and the specific objectives that were introduced as part of the STEP Regulation. However, the requirements set out in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 in relation to climate-related investments will continue to apply.  Mid-term review  · In order that Member State s could effectively make use of the new priorities and flexibilities, it is proposed they be allowed to re-submit their mid-term review proposal by 2 months after the entry into force of these regulatory amendments .  · To help accelerate the implementation of the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund, all programmes that reallocate at least 15% of their resources for the newly introduced specific objectives and STEP would receive a one-off pre-financing of 4.5% on the basis of their amended programme budget (with the exception of NUTS 2 regions that have borders with Russia, Belarus or Ukraine , that benefit of the higher one-off prefinancing of 9.5% ) . The additional pre-financing related to the above set new priority areas would come in addition.  · In addition, the end-date for eligibility of expenditure is extended by one additional year for ERDF and Cohesion Fund programmes for which at least 15% of the envelope is refocused towards the new priority areas .  · In order to provide flexibility regarding the calculation of climate contribution, where the climate contribution as referred to in Article 6(1)  of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 is exceeded for either the Cohesion Fund or the ERDF, the amount exceeding the target could be taken into account when calculating the climate contribution for the other fund.  Further amendments aimed at streamlining the implementation include:  · The possibility for Member States to reallocate resources from the ERDF to the Interregional Innovation Investments Instrument;  · The possibility to support activities that contribute to the implementation of reforms;  · The duly justified revision of output indicator targets as part of a JTF programme amendment while ensuring that such revisions do not affect the transition to climate neutrality and fossil fuel phase out commitments .  2025/0084 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulations (EU) 2021/1058 and (EU) 2021/1056 as regards specific measures to address strategic challenges in the context of the mid-term review  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 175, 177, 178 and 322 thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 2 ,  Having regard to t he opinion of the Committee of the Regions 3 ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) In recent years, geopolitical dynamics have been marked by profound uncertainty, necessitating a fundamental re-evaluation of the Union ’s strategic autonomy , resilience and security alongside the challenges stemming from the green, social and technological transitions. Th o se simultaneous transformations demonstrate the urgent need to close the innovation gap, accelerate decarbonisation efforts to reinforce economic competitiveness and reduce external dependencies by diversifying supply chains , scaling-up domestically produced green energy, and investing in critical sectors .  (2) As the Union ’s main investment instrument within the Multiannual Financial Framework, cohesion policy plays a crucial role in supporting th o se priorities. It drives targeted investments that contribute to economic, social and territorial cohesion while at the same time addressing emerging challenges.  (3) The legal framework for cohesion policy programmes provides for a mid-term review in 2025, which offers a timely and unique opportunity to refocus programmes on addressing new challenges and opportunities, to accelerate implementation and to increase their effectiveness to respond to both old and new Union priorities.  (4) The Commission presented in the Competitiveness Compass, the Clean Industrial Deal and the Affordable Energy Action Plan a concrete path for Europe to regain its competitiveness and secure sustainable prosperity. The ERDF and the Cohesion Fund already support investments to climate objectives as stipulated in Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 . However , Member States should step up their efforts in order to ensure  that decarbonisation is a driver for growth for European industries and the prosperity of Europeans by, amongst others, scaling up support to clean-tech and the transition to clean energy, investing in energy infrastructure projects that can ensure a true Energy Union as well as supporting decarbonisation of production processes and products.  (5) In light of the unprecedented geopolitical instability and the need for the Union to guarantee its own defence, cohesion policy funding should be swiftly mobilised to directly support investments in defence capabilities . It is therefore necessary to create new specific objectives for support from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the Cohesion Fund established by Regulation (EU) 2021/1058 of the European Parliament and of the Council 4 to finance industrial capacities in the defence sector and to allow for investments in resilient d efence or d ual-use infrastructure with a view to fostering military mobility , in line with the scope of those funds . Industrial capacities to foster defence capabilities should relate to the technological development and production of defence products and other products for defence purposes, as defined in Article 2 of [draft] Council Regulation [xxxx] establishing the Security Action for Europe (SAFE) through the reinforcement of European defence industry Instrument, in particular those referred to in Article 1 of that Regulation. Member States are encouraged to use the possibility foreseen in the current legal framework of voluntarily transferring resources allocated to them in shared management to directly managed programmes with defence and security objectives. In this context, transfers to the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) military mobility envelope would ensure coordinated interventions along the military mobility corridors highlighted in the White Paper on Defence.  (6) Furthermore, in order to quickly inject liquidity to cover the most pressing needs notably for investments in enhanced defence capabilities , additional financing possibilities should be offered . In particular, it is necessary to provide for an additional one-off pre-financing of 30% of the amounts programmed under dedicated priorities for defence under the respective policy objectives of the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund and the possibility to apply a Union co-financing rate of up to 100%.  (7) The ERDF and the Cohesion Fund may , within their respective scopes, already support investments contributing to the objectives of the ‘ Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform ’ (STEP) , which aims to strengthen Europe’s technological leadership . In order to further incentivise investments from the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund in th o se critical fields , the limitation for the overall contribution of the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund to th o se priorities should be removed and the possibility for Member States to receive a higher pre-financing for related programme amendments should be extended . Furthermore, the possibilities for the financing of productive investments contributing to STEP objectives in enterprises other than SMEs should be extended to all regions . Similarly, such investments should also be possible in regions where they facilitate industrial adjustment linked to digital transformation, including digital capacities in cloud, AI and supercomputing, or the decarbonisation and circularity of production processes and products, such as in the automotive industry or the energy intensive industries . In addition, the possibility provided for investments contributing to STEP objectives to finance productive investments in enterprises other than SMEs from the Just Transition Fund (JTF) established by Regulation (EU) 2021/1056 of the European Parliament and of the Council 5 without the need and irrespective of the outcome of a gap analysis should be extended to all investments.  (8) In order to enhance energy security , accelerate the energy transition and clean mobility, the investments under STEP and the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Facility should be complemented by creating a new specific objective for the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund under policy objective 2 to promote energy interconnectors and related transmission infrastructure, and the deployment of charging infrastructure. I n order to accel erate investments in t hese fields , p riorities dedicated to this specific objective should benefit from an additional one-off pre-financing of 30% of the amounts programmed under those priorities and from the possibility to apply a Union co-financing rate of up to 100 %. Managing authorities should aim to leverage a maximum amount of private finance, where relevant. This enhanced investment effort will enable energy-intensive sectors to access more stable and diverse energy sources in a less fragmented internal energy market, buttressing their sustainability and competitiveness. Moreover, expanding the ERDF’s support for decarbonisation projects allows energy-intensive industries to prioritise high-impact innovations aligned with EU climate objectives.  (9) I mportant P rojects of C ommon E uropean I nterest (IPCEI) result from a State aid instrument requiring cross-European cooperation for innovative technologies or pan-European infrastructures. IPCEI are projects that support and promote large-scale, cross-border projects that are considered essential for the economic growth, innovation, and competitiveness of the Union . To help accelerate the design of new IPCEI and the implementation of the existing ones, support from the ERDF for investments in projects participating in an IPCEI as approved by the Commission pursuant to Article 107(3), point (b), of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and to Communication C ( 2021 ) 8481 should be allowed in all categories of region s . F urthermore, operations contributing to an IPCEI approved by the Commission should benefit from simplified selection procedures.  (10) Affordable housing is another challenge that has come to the forefront due to the significant increase in prices and rents in recent years. With a view to incentivis ing Member States and regions to double investments from the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund, within their respective scopes, in the construction and renovation of the affordable housing stock, includ ing social housing, new specific objectives should be created under different policy objectives to provide flexibility for the programming of housing interventions under dedicated priorit ies . Such priorities should entail the possibility to apply a Union co-financing rate of up to 100% and benefit from an additional one-off pre-financing of 30% of the amounts programmed in order to alleviate the burden on public budgets . For example, investments under the ‘New European Bauhaus’ initiative should make full use of those new possibilities. Costs resulting from the temporary renting of alternative accommodation for the occupants during the time of the renovation may also be entitled to support under such priorities , as well as costs of reforms related to housing , such as preparatory work for improvements in housing market regulation and permitting at local and city level. It is also appropriate to clarify the support of the JTF in th at context.  (11) Water has a vital role as a resource for the security of food, energy and economic systems. This is also a key aspect of ensuring climate resilience. Given the challenges posed by the impact of climate change on water resources, f urther investments in water resilience should be encouraged. It is urgent to enhance the implementation of the water and marine protection legislation and improve water efficiency, address water scarcity, and progress towards a water resilient Europe.  This requires important investments. It is therefore appropriate to include a reference to secure access to water, sustainable water management and water resilience in the new specific objective under policy objective 2 to allow for proactive, risk-based management and increased preparedness. Dedicated priorities established for th at specific objective should also benefit from an additional one-off pre-financing of 30% of the amounts programmed and the possibility of a co-financing rate of up to 100% in order to incentivise crucial investments in th at field.  (12) Finally, in order to enhance the effectiveness of investments, it is important to allow for the payment of costs related to the implementation of reforms, also where such costs are not directly linked to the implementation of investments.  (13) In order to enable Member States to carry out a meaningful reprogramming in the context of the mid-term review and focus resources on those new strategic Union priorities, additional restrictions should be lifted. As regards thematic concentration requirements, it is appropriate to allow Member States to count amounts programmed for new strategic priorities , including those contributing to STEP objectives , towards the amounts required to ensure compliance with thematic concentration requirements . This should be accompanied with some flexibility regarding the calculation of the respective climate contribution for the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund as set out in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2 0 21/1060 , while respecting the overall requirements of that Article . In addition, to accelerate the decarbonisation of industry that is necessary for reaching the Union’s climate objectives, it is necessary to provide for the possibility to finance , through the ERDF , investments aimed at achieving the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions also from activities listed in Annex I to Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 6 provided that they have been awarded a Seal Excellence . Similarly , as regards the JTF , the conditions for financing such investments should be simplified. Furthermore, in order to ensure consistency of support between financing granted under direct and shared management, operations that have already been assessed in the context of directly managed programmes and been attributed a ‘ Sovereignty Seal ’ as defined in Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) 2024/795 in a call for proposals under Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/856 by the Commission should not be subject to the fossil fuel exclusion . Member States should also be given the possibility to contribute resources from the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund to the Member State compartment of the InvestEU Fund 7 to deploy them through the InvestEU financial instrument set out in [ Article 10a of Regulation (EU) 2021/523 ] . Finally, in order to allow for a comprehensive reprogramming towards the new strategic priorities in the context of the mid-term review, Member States shou ld benefit from additional time to comple ment the assessment of the outcome of the mid - term review and the submission of related programme amendments . This should also apply to JTF resources where they are included in a programme together with ERDF or Cohesion Fund resources.  (14) In order to accelerate the implementation of cohesion policy programmes more generally and inject the necessary liquidity for key investments to be implemented, an additional one-off pre-financing for the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund should be paid for programmes under both the Investment for jobs and growth goal and u nder European territorial cooperation goal (Interreg) , when the reprogramming concerns a substantial share of the overall prog r amme . The pre-financing percentage should be further increased for certain programmes under the Investment for jobs and growth goal covering one or more NUTS2 regions bordering Russia , Belarus or Ukraine , given the adverse impact on those regions of the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine . In order to incentivise the re-programming towards key priorities in the context of the mid-term review, the additional pre- financing shou ld only be av a ilable where a certain threshold for the reallocat i on of financial resources to specific crucial priorities is reached in that context .  (15) Furthermore, to take account of the time needed to refocus investments in the context of the mid-term review and allow best use of available resources , the deadlines for the eligibility of expenditure as well as decommitment rules should be adjusted for programmes carrying out a reallocation of resources to strategic priorities in the context of the mid - term review exercise . It should also be possible to apply a maximum co-financing rate of up to 100% to priorities in programmes under the Investment for jobs and growth goal covering one or more NUTS2 regions bordering Russia , Belarus or Ukraine, given the adverse impact on those regions of the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine .  (16) The mid-term review should also be used to reinforce the crucial role of cities in delivering many Union objectives by giving Member States the possibility to reallocate f inancial resources from the ERDF to reinforce the European Urban Initiative referred to in Article 12 of Regulation (EU) 2021/1058. In addition, in order to facilitate the uptake of key innovative actions identified under the European Urban Initiative, such actions should benefit from a simplified selection procedure for support under cohesion policy programmes. Member States should also be provided with the possibility to reallocate ERDF resources from their programmes under the Investment for j obs and g rowth g oal to the Interregional Innovation Investment I nstrument referred to in Article 13 of Regulation (EU) 2021/ 1058 to enhance flexibility in the use of resources.  (17) In order to simplify delivery and accelerate investments, it is appropriate to make additional targeted changes to the regulatory framework governing the use of the JTF . In particular, the possibility for a simplified selection procedure for operations that have been attributed a Seal of Excellence should be extended to the JTF. Furthermore, the limitations for the revision of targets should be removed in order to provide for the necessary flexibility in the context of changing implementation circumstances.  (18) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely to refocus investments on critical priorities in the context of the mid-term review and to simplify and accelerate policy delivery by amending Regulations (EU) 2021/1058 and (EU) 2021/105 6 cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union . In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.  (19) Regulations (EU) 2021/1058 and (EU) 2021/1056 should therefore be amended accordingly.  (20) Given the urgen t need to enable crucial investments notably in defence capabilities in the context of pressing geopolitical challenges , this Regulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union ,  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Article 1  Regulation (EU) 2021/1058 is amended as follows:  (1) Article 3 is amended as follows:  (a) paragraph 1 is amended as follows:  (i) in point (a), the following point (vii) is added:  ‘(vii) enhancing industrial capacities to foster dual use as well as defence  capabilities.’;  (ii) in point (b), point (v) is replaced by the following:  ‘(v) promoting secure access to water, sustainable water management and water resilience;’;  (iii) the following points (xi) and (xii) are added:  ‘(xi) promoting access to affordable  housing, and related reforms;  (xii) promoting energy interconnectors and related transmission infrastructure, and the deployment of recharging infrastructure.’;  (iv) in point (c), the following point (iii) is added:  ‘(iii) developing resilient defence or dual use infrastructure to foster military mobility in the Union.’;  (v) in point (d), the following point (vii) is added:  ‘(vii) promoting access to affordable  housing, and related reforms.’;  (vi) in point (e), first subparagraph, the following point (iii) is added:  ‘(iii) fostering integrated territorial development, through access to affordable  housing, and the development of related reforms in all types of territories.’;  (vii) The following subparagraph is added in paragraph 1:  ‘Operations supported under the specific objective set out in point (c)(iii) shall primarlily focus, where relevant, on one or more of the four EU Priority Military Mobility Corridors identified by Member States in Annex II to the Military Requirements for Military Mobility within and beyond the EU as adopted by the Council on [18 March 2025 and with reference ST 6728/25 ADD1].

FRAMEWORK OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE  1.1. Title of the proposal/initiative  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL amending Regulation 2021/1056 and Regulation 2021/1058 […]  1.2. Policy area(s) concerned  Cohesion policy: European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), Cohesion Fund and Just Transition Fund (JTF)  1.3. Objective(s)  1.3.1. General objective(s)  The cohesion policy funds and the JTF provide financing in support of the harmonious development of the EU, through actions that lead to the strengthening of its economic, social and territorial cohesion.

The proposal/initiative relates to:   a new action   a new action following a pilot project / preparatory action 8   the extension of an existing action   a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action  1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative  1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative  Recent economic and geopolitical events have brought to the front important priorities that require substantial investments. Cohesion policy provides a strong framework for such investments, and the specific investments within the scope of this amendment are already possible to a large extent under the current legal framework governing the Funds. Therefore, they are already in line with the overall objective of strengthening economic, social and territorial cohesion. However, the pace and volume of investments need to be increase. The ongoing mid-term review of the 2021-2027 cohesion policy programmes provides a crucial opportunity to assess how these programmes can help deliver on the policy objectives. Therefore, the current amendment creates incentives and flexibilities to allow Member States to put a greater focus with resources from the MFF on these priorities within a relatively short time frame.  1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, great er effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this section 'added value of EU involvement' is the value resulting from EU action, that is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.  Overall :  The amendment is designed to allow Member States to direct necessary cohesion policy funding to investments in policy areas that have been identified as priorities, and to maintain and strenghten the economic, social and territorial cohesion of the EU.  Specific objective 1:  Cohesion policy funding is vital for economic stability, fairness, and integration in the EU. It plays a primary role in reducing regional disparities and ensuring balanced development across all Member States. It ensures that all regions have the resources to grow, innovate, and adapt to future challenges while promoting EU-wide solidarity. Maintaining and accelerateing the flow of funds to the Member States from the EU budget is essential for ensuring the necessery level of public funding in Member States and to achieve the cohesion objectives enshrined in the Treaty.  Specific objective 2  Defence : The Versailles Declaration of March 2022, as well as communications JOIN(2022) 24 and COM(2022) 60 already outlined the need for the EU to step up its own preparedness, capability and resilience to better protect its citizens. The rapidly evolving geopolitical context of the past months has emphasised the need to step up the efforts. The European Council conclusions of 6 March 2025 stress “that Europe must become more sovereign, more responsible for its own defence and better equipped to act and deal autonomously with immediate and future challenges and threats with a 360° approach”. To that end, the EU will accelerate the mobilisation of the necessary instruments and financing. The European Council “calls on the Commission to propose additional funding sources for defence at EU level, including by means of additional possibilities and incentives offered to all Member States, on the basis of the principles of objectivity, non-discrimination and equal treatment of Member States, in the use of their current allocations under the relevant EU funding programmes, and to swiftly present relevant proposals”.  Competitiveness : Strengthening the competitiveness and resilience in strategic sectors and reducing the dependencies of the European economy through the green and digital transformations has been the EU compass over the last years. The STEP Regulation has already introduced increased possibilities for supporting strategic technologies and critical sectors, through the use of the cohesion policy funds. The proposal gives further impetus to use the scale of the EU to invest in areas important for the EU’s future competitiveness.  Affordable housing : The recent cost-of-living crisis has exacerbated a longstanding problem with housing affordability in the EU. The general trend can be observed in all Member States and the political guidelines acknowledge that this is putting a strain on cohesion. To that end, a taskforce has been set up within the Commission and the European Parliament has set up a special Committee on Housing. In anticipation of, and in line with the general objective of the European Affordable Housing Plan, the mid-term review of the cohesion policy programmes provides an opportunity to emphasise the importance of water resilience and to create incentives that would allow Member States to direct parts of their cohesion policy allocations to measures that support affordable housing.  Energy interconnectors and related transmission infrastructure, and recharging infrastructure : Enhancing energy security and integration, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and bolstering energy independence is crucial for the EU to support a sustainable and resilient energy system. Cohesion policy already invests in the developement of smart energy systems and in the deployment of charging infrastructure supporting electric mobility.  To accelerate investment efforts in this area and achieve greater cross-border energy integration, it is however important to provide specific incentives for the promotion of energy interconnectors and related transmission infrastructure, and the deployment of charging infrastructure supporting electric mobility.  Access to water and water management : Despite the EU’s comprehensive legal framework to protect and sustainably manage water resources, structural mismanagement of water has resulted in the continued degradation and pollution of this resource and water-related ecosystems, including coastal and marine ones. Over the last 5 years, floods, prolonged droughts and water scarcity have affected more and more areas of the EU and this is exacerbated by climate change, pollution and biodiversity loss. The transboundary nature of water challenges, their cross-cutting nature and their relevance to delivering EU policies and legislation in various domains provide a clear basis for a European strategy on water resilience. In anticipation of the strategy, the mid-term review of the cohesion policy programmes provides an opportunity to direct the necessary financing to projects that tackle security of access, sustainable water management and water resilience.  1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past  Recent amendments to the 2014-2020 and 2021-2027 Regulations in the context of the COVID-19 crisis, the military aggression of Russia in Ukraine, the energy crisis, and competitiveness (STEP) have resulted in an important uptake of funds to support relevant investments.  1.5.4. Compatibility with the multiannual financial framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments  The amendment does not alter the existing cohesion policy allocations and is intended to help accelerate investments of the Funds in an efficient and effective manner.  1.5.5. Assessment of the different available financing options, including scope for redeployment  The amendment does not alter the core structure of the existing cohesion policy regulatory framework, nor does it alter the fixed Member State allocations. It is intended to emphasise and incentivise support measures that are already possible within the scope of the funds and that are complementary to investments through other financing options either at EU level or at Member State level.  1.6. Duration of the proposal/initiative and of its financial impact  ☑ limited duration  – ☑ financial impact from 2026 to 2029 for payment appropriations. No impact on commitments appropriations.  1.7. Method(s) of budget implementation planned 9  ☑ Shared management with the Member States  2. MANAGEMENT MEASURES  2.1. Monitoring and reporting rules  The monitoring and reporting rules laid down in Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 remain fully applicable:  Programme monitoring committee: minimum once a year  Annual performance review between the Member State and the Commission  Data transmission per programme: five times per year  Annual control (audit) report.  A final performance report for each programme needs to be submitted by 15 February 2031.  2.2. Management and control system(s)  2.2.1. Justification of the budget implementation method(s), the funding implementation mechanism(s), the payment modalities and the control strategy proposed  The proposal for amendment does not alter the existing shared management budget implementation method, nor does it change the implementation mechanisms, the payment modalities or the control strategies defined in Regulation (EU) 2021/1060.  2.2.2. Information concerning the risks identified and the internal control system(s) set up to mitigate them  No specific risks have been identified. The proposal for amendment does not structurally alter the risk-management and control setup of the cohesion policy programmes, which is considered appropriate for the envisaged investments.  2.2.3. Estimation and justification of the cost-effectiveness of the controls (ratio between the control costs  and the value of the related funds managed), and assessment of the expected levels of risk of error (at payment & at closure)  The control framework of cohesion policy remains unchanged and fully applicable. This has been designed to protect the financial interests of the EU and adjusted over multiple programming periods to take into account the recommendations of ECA and OLAF.  2.3. Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities  Member States need to comply with the existing cohesion policy control framework, and need to have in place a management and control system that allows for the prevention, detection and correction and reporting on irregularities, including fraud.  3.

of 18 September 2025
amending Regulations (EU) 2021/1058 and (EU) 2021/1056 as regards specific measures to address strategic challenges in the context of the mid-term review
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 175, 177, 178 and 322 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions(2),
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure(3),
Whereas:
(1) In recent years, geopolitical dynamics have been marked by profound uncertainty, necessitating a fundamental re-evaluation of the Union’s strategic autonomy and resilience and the safeguarding of democratic principles and the rule of law alongside the challenges stemming from the green, social and technological transitions. Those simultaneous transitions demonstrate the urgent need to close the innovation gap, to accelerate decarbonisation efforts, to reinforce economic competitiveness and to reduce external dependencies, by diversifying supply chains, scaling up domestically produced green energy, and investing in critical sectors.
(2) As the Union’s main investment instrument within the multiannual financial framework, cohesion policy drives targeted investments that contribute to economic, social and territorial cohesion, as set out in Article 3(3) of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and Article 174 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), while at the same time addressing emerging challenges. Moreover, the mid-term review is committed to the partnership principle and the principle of multi-level governance to safeguard an effective, regional and citizen-centred implementation of cohesion policy. Therefore, any reallocation under the mid-term review should be carried out in accordance with the European code of conduct on partnership(4).
(3) The legal framework for cohesion policy programmes provides for a mid-term review in 2025, which offers a timely and unique opportunity to refocus programmes on addressing new challenges and opportunities, to accelerate implementation and to increase their effectiveness to respond to both old and new Union priorities, without prejudice to other Union legal acts or to the next multiannual financial framework.
(4) In light of the importance of horizontal enabling conditions applicable to all specific objectives and the criteria necessary for the assessment of their fulfilment, within the meaning of Article 15(1), second subparagraph, of and Annex III to Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 of the European Parliament and of the Council(5)for the effective and efficient use of the overall Union support granted by those Union Funds and the need to ensure the practical effect of those Union Funds, the amounts exceeding the flexibility amount referred to in Article 86(1), second subparagraph, of that Regulation, which correspond to specific objectives that are subject to a negative assessment by the Commission on the basis of the application of those horizontal enabling conditions should not be subject to a programme amendment or transfer on the basis of the new priorities and flexibility provided for in the amending provisions set out in this Regulation. Such a proportionate measure constitutes a necessary incentive, intended to ensure that Member State law and practice continues to comply with the horizontal enabling conditions and that the expenditure covered by the Union Funds meets the Union’s objectives.Since Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2020/2092 of the European Parliament and of the Council(6)is of horizontal application, the same requirement should apply to the amounts corresponding to commitments suspended by measures adopted on the basis of that Regulation. Amounts within the flexibility amount referred to in Article 86(1), second subparagraph, of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 and corresponding to the specific objectives subject to a negative assessment by the Commission on the basis of the application of the horizontal enabling conditions can be subject to a programme amendment or transfer on the basis of new priorities, provided that such new priorities comply with the objectives pursued by the horizontal enabling conditions.
(5) In its communication of 29 January 2025 entitled ‘A Competitiveness Compass for the EU’ as well as its communication of 26 February 2025 entitled ‘The Clean Industrial Deal: A joint roadmap for competitiveness and decarbonisation’ and the accompanying Action Plan for Affordable Energy, the Commission presented a concrete path for Europe to regain its competitiveness and secure sustainable prosperity. The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the Cohesion Fund, established by Regulation (EU) 2021/1058 of the European Parliament and of the Council(7), already support investments to climate objectives as laid down in Regulation (EU) 2021/1060. However, Member States should step up their efforts in order to ensure that decarbonisation is a driver for growth for European industries and the prosperity of European citizens by, inter alia, scaling up support for clean technology and the transition to clean energy, investing in energy infrastructure projects that can ensure a true Energy Union, and supporting decarbonisation of production processes and products.
(6) In light of the unprecedented geopolitical instability and the need for the Union to ensure its own defence and civil preparedness, cohesion policy funding should be swiftly mobilised to directly support investments in defence capabilities and civil security. It is therefore necessary to create new specific objectives for support from the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund to finance industrial capacities in the defence sector and to allow for investments in resilient defence or dual-use infrastructure, including with a view to fostering military mobility and enhancing civil preparedness including cyber and civil security that are not necessarily related to mobility, in line with the scope of those funds and the ‘do no significant harm’ principle and in cooperation with regional and local authorities. In addition, it should be possible to support civil preparedness as part of territorial and local development strategies. Industrial capacities to foster defence capabilities should relate to the technological development and production of defence products and other products for defence purposes, as defined in Council Regulation (EU) 2025/1106(8), in particular those referred to in Article 1 of that Regulation. Member States are encouraged to use the possibility provided for in the current legal framework to voluntarily transfer resources allocated to them under shared management to directly managed programmes with defence and security objectives. In that context, transfers to the military mobility envelope under the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) would ensure coordinated interventions along the military mobility corridors referred to in the Joint White Paper of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the Commission of 19 March 2025 on European Defence– Readiness 2030. When supporting such investments, Member States are to consider, where applicable, the eligibility criteria set out in Article 9 of Regulation (EU) 2021/697 of the European Parliament and of the Council(9), the eligibility rules set out in Article 16 of Regulation (EU) 2025/1106, or the relevant provisions of European defence industry programmes. Investments in dual-use infrastructure and capacities should be prioritised.
(7) Particular attention and exceptional support should be dedicated to the Union’s Eastern border regions neighbouring Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, given their unique security challenges and geopolitical significance. Those regions are particularly exposed to external threats, including hybrid attacks. Strengthening local defence capabilities and community resilience in those regions is essential not only to deter potential aggression and safeguard European security, but also to support regional development, promote social cohesion, generate employment, and improve living conditions.
(8) In the allocation and implementation of cohesion policy resources directed towards defence-related objectives, Member States should prioritise projects that promote employment, skills development and industrial diversification at regional level. Particular emphasis should be placed on supporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and regional clusters active in dual-use technologies, cybersecurity and artificial intelligence, ensuring that such investments serve the Union’s strategic interests and the objective of economic, social and territorial cohesion.
(9) Investments in upgrading transport networks to meet military requirements also deliver significant benefits for civilian mobility, economic connectivity and crisis response capacities within the Union. Such investments improve cross-border infrastructure, reduce bottlenecks, enhance preparedness and contribute to the resilience of regions and critical supply chains. Furthermore, transport hubs enabling the rapid deployment of emergency services and the distribution of essential supplies, contribute significantly to the continuity of vital functions and national security.
(10) Furthermore, in order to quickly inject liquidity to cover the most pressing needs, for investments in enhanced defence capabilities and infrastructure by, in particular, prioritising capabilities and infrastructure of a dual-use nature, and civil preparedness, additional financing possibilities should be offered. In particular, it is necessary to provide for additional one-off pre-financing of 20 % of the amounts programmed under such dedicated priorities under the relevant policy objectives of the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund and the possibility of applying a higher Union co-financing rate.
(11) The ERDF and the Cohesion Fund can, within their respective scope of support, already provide support for investments that contribute to the objectives of the Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (STEP) established by Regulation (EU) 2024/795 of the European Parliament and of the Council(10), which aims to strengthen Europe’s technological leadership. In order to provide further incentives for investments from the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund in those critical fields, the limitation for the overall contribution of the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund to those priorities should be removed and the possibility for Member States to receive a higher pre-financing for related programme amendments should be extended. The priorities which support investments contributing to STEP objectives under a request for a programme amendment that was submitted to the Commission by 31 March 2025 are to receive the exceptional one-off pre-financing applicable at the time of the submission of that request.Furthermore, the possibilities for the financing of productive investments contributing to STEP objectives in enterprises other than SMEs should apply to all Member States and regions with a GDP per capita below the EU-27 average, while preserving a focus on SMEs. Such investments should also be possible in regions where they facilitate industrial adjustment linked to the digital transition, including digital capacities in cloud computing, AI and supercomputing, and the decarbonisation and circularity of production processes and products, such as in the automotive industry or energy intensive industries. In addition, the possibility provided for investments contributing to STEP objectives to finance productive investments in enterprises other than SMEs from the Just Transition Fund (JTF) established by Regulation (EU) 2021/1056 of the European Parliament and of the Council(11)should be extended to all investments, while preserving a focus on SMEs, where such investments are necessary for, inter alia, the implementation of the just transition plan and for job creation.
(12) In order to enhance energy security, accelerate the energy transition and promote clean mobility, investments under STEP and the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Facility provided for by Regulation (EU) 2023/1804 of the European Parliament and of the Council(12)should be complemented by creating a new specific objective for the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund under policy objective 2 to promote energy interconnectors and related transmission, distribution, storage and supporting infrastructure, as well as to protect and safeguard that infrastructure and to enhance the deployment of charging infrastructure. Supporting energy infrastructure refers to any facilities, equipment, and systems that support the interconnection of Member States’ transmission systems by enabling the generation, transmission, distribution, and storage of energy. In order to accelerate investments in those fields, priorities dedicated to that specific objective should benefit from additional one-off pre-financing of 20 % of the amounts programmed under those priorities and from the possibility of applying a higher Union co-financing rate. Managing authorities are expected to aim to leverage a maximum amount of private finance, where relevant. That enhanced investment effort will enable energy-intensive sectors to access more stable and diverse energy sources in a less fragmented internal energy market, buttressing their sustainability and competitiveness. Moreover, expanding the ERDF’s support for decarbonisation projects allows energy-intensive industries to prioritise high-impact innovations that are aligned with the Union’s climate objectives.
(13) Important projects of common European interest (IPCEIs), namely projects that support and promote large-scale, cross-border projects that are considered to be essential for the economic growth, innovation, and competitiveness of the Union, are deemed to be compatible with the internal market where they enable cross-European cooperation for innovative technologies or pan-European infrastructures. To help accelerate the design of new and the implementation of existing IPCEIs, support from the ERDF for investments in projects participating in an IPCEI which the Commission has found to be compatible with the internal market pursuant to Article 107(3), point (b), TFEU having taken into account the Commission communication of 25 November 2021 entitled ‘Criteria for the analysis of the compatibility with the internal market of State aid to promote the execution of important projects of common European interest’, should be allowed in all categories of regions. Furthermore, operations contributing to an IPCEI approved by the Commission should benefit from simplified selection procedures.
(14) Affordable and sustainable housing is another challenge that has come to the forefront due to the significant increase in prices and rents in recent years. Disadvantaged groups and low-income and middle-income families are particularly affected and face more difficulties in accessing housing and a growing risk of homelessness. With a view to providing incentives for Member States and regions to double investments from the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund, within their respective scope of support, in the construction and renovation of the affordable and sustainable housing stock, including social housing, new specific objectives should be created under different policy objectives to provide flexibility for the programming of housing interventions under dedicated priorities, while acknowledging that the definition of affordability can vary according to the circumstances of each Member State. Such priorities should be compatible with Directive (EU) 2024/1275 of the European Parliament and of the Council(13)and should entail the possibility of applying a higher Union co-financing rate and of an additional one-off pre-financing of 20 % of the amounts programmed in order to alleviate the burden on public budgets in all categories of regions. For example, investments under the principles and values of the ‘New European Bauhaus’ initiative should make full use of those new possibilities. Costs resulting from the temporary renting of alternative accommodation for the occupants during the time of the renovation can also be eligible for support under such priorities. It is also appropriate to clarify the support of the JTF in that context.
(15) Water has a vital role as a resource for the security of food, energy and economic systems. Its role as a resource is also a key aspect of ensuring climate resilience. Given the challenges posed by the impact of climate change on water resources, further investments in water resilience should be encouraged. The implementation of water and marine protection legislation should be enhanced, water efficiency should be improved, water scarcity should be addressed, and progress towards a water-resilient Europe should be made, urgently. That implementation requires significant investments, including in water reuse for non-agricultural purposes, blue biotechnology, infrastructure for addressing water stress and drought prevention, the deployment of nature-based solutions, the ecological restoration of freshwater ecosystems, and the improvement of wastewater treatment. For populations living in regions particularly affected by water scarcity, desalination, if carried out in a sustainable manner, as referred to in the Commission communication of 4 June 2025 entitled ‘European Water Resilience Strategy’, can also play a key role in ensuring secure access to water and should therefore be eligible for support. It is therefore appropriate to include a reference to secure access to water, sustainable water management, including integrated water management, and water resilience in the specific objective under policy objective 2 to allow for proactive, risk-based management and increased preparedness. New dedicated priorities established for that specific objective should also benefit from additional one-off pre-financing of 20 % of the amounts programmed and the possibility of a higher co-financing rate in order to provide incentives for crucial investments in that field. It should also be possible to provide support from the JTF for water-related investments where such investments address acute water stress, enhance climate resilience, and support the transition to a sustainable and diversified local economy, even when not directly linked to land restoration projects.
(16) In order to enable Member States to carry out meaningful reprogramming in the context of the mid-term review and to focus resources on those new strategic Union priorities, additional restrictions should be lifted. As regards thematic concentration requirements, it is appropriate to allow Member States to count amounts programmed for new strategic priorities, regardless of whether Member States comply with thematic concentration at national level or at the level of category of region, including those contributing to STEP objectives, towards the amounts required to ensure compliance with thematic concentration requirements. The flexibility with regard to thematic concentration requirements should be accompanied by some flexibility regarding the calculation of the climate contribution for the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund pursuant to Article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060, while respecting the overall requirements of that Article. In addition, Member States should also be given the possibility of contributing resources from the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund to the Member State compartment of the InvestEU Fund established by Regulation (EU) 2021/523 of the European Parliament and of the Council(14)to deploy them through the financial instrument provided for in the InvestEU Programme.Finally, in order to allow for a comprehensive reprogramming towards the new strategic priorities in the context of the mid-term review, Member States should benefit from additional time to complement their assessment of the outcome of the mid-term review and their submission of related programme amendments. That additional time for reprogramming should also apply to JTF resources where they are included in a programme together with ERDF and Cohesion Fund resources or resources of the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+) established by Regulation (EU) 2021/1057 of the European Parliament and of the Council(15). Amendments to programmes under the European territorial cooperation goal (Interreg) are submitted in accordance with Article 19 of Regulation (EU) 2021/1059 of the European Parliament and of the Council(16).
(17) In order to accelerate the implementation of cohesion policy programmes more generally and inject the necessary liquidity for key investments to be implemented, additional one-off pre-financing for the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund should be paid for programmes under both the Investment for jobs and growth goal and under Interreg when the reprogramming concerns a substantial share of the overall programme. The pre-financing percentage should be further increased for certain programmes under the Investment for jobs and growth goal covering one or more NUTS level 2 regions bordering Russia, Belarus or Ukraine, given the adverse impact on those regions of the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine. In order to encourage re-programming towards key priorities in the context of the mid-term review, the additional one-off pre-financing should be available only where a certain threshold for the reallocation of financial resources to specific crucial priorities is reached in that context.
(18) To take account of the time needed to refocus investments in the context of the mid-term review and allow best use of available resources, the final date for the eligibility of expenditure and the decommitment rules should be adjusted for programmes that carry out a reallocation of resources to strategic priorities in the context of the mid-term review exercise. It should also be possible to apply a higher co-financing rate to priorities in programmes under the Investment for jobs and growth goal covering one or more NUTS level 2 regions bordering Russia, Belarus or Ukraine, taking into account the adverse impact on those regions of the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine and with due regard to the need for timely closure, the commencement of new programmes and the full absorption of programme funding.
(19) The mid-term review should also be used to reinforce the crucial role of cities and functional urban areas in delivering many Union objectives by giving Member States the possibility, in close cooperation with the regional and local authorities and keeping in mind the regional specificities and the scope of the cohesion policy, of reallocating financial resources from the ERDF to reinforce the European Urban Initiative referred to in Article 12 of Regulation (EU) 2021/1058. In addition, in order to facilitate the uptake of key innovative actions identified under the European Urban Initiative, such actions should benefit from a simplified selection procedure for support under cohesion policy programmes. To enhance flexibility in the use of resources, Member States should also be provided with the possibility of reallocating ERDF resources from their programmes under the Investment for jobs and growth goal to the Interregional Innovation Investment Instrument referred to in Article 13 of Regulation (EU) 2021/1058.
(20) In order to simplify delivery and accelerate investments, it is appropriate to make additional targeted changes to the regulatory framework governing the use of the JTF. In particular, the possibility for a simplified selection procedure for operations that have been attributed a Seal of Excellence should be extended to the JTF. Furthermore, the limitations for the revision of targets should be removed in order to provide for the necessary flexibility in the context of changing implementation circumstances.
(21) To support Member States in their swift and correct reprogramming, the Commission should provide timely and clear technical clarifications and support to managing authorities, including through a structured system, by answering technical, legal and procedural questions, in particular with regard to measures introduced by this Regulation.
(22) Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely to refocus investments on critical priorities in the context of the mid-term review and to simplify and accelerate policy delivery by amending Regulations (EU) 2021/1058 and (EU) 2021/1056, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
(23) Regulations (EU) 2021/1058 and (EU) 2021/1056 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(24) Given the urgent need to enable crucial investments, in particular in defence capabilities in the context of pressing geopolitical challenges, this Regulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication in theOfficial Journal of the European Union,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in theOfficial Journal of the European Union.

Done at Brussels, 18 September 2025.",https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202501914,"The European Commission has proposed amendments to the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), Cohesion Fund, and Just Transition Fund as part of a mid-term review aimed at addressing strategic challenges and priorities. This proposal seeks to realign resources to enhance the EU's defense capabilities, competitiveness, and strategic autonomy, while also focusing on emerging priorities such as clean industrial deals and climate resilience. Recognizing that the current regulatory framework is outdated due to recent geopolitical and economic shifts, the Commission suggests adjustments to increase flexibility and accelerate investments in critical areas like technological leadership, energy independence, and climate resilience.

The proposal addresses challenges faced by energy-intensive industries, such as higher energy costs and increased international competition, which threaten Europe's decarbonization and resilience goals. To counter these challenges, the cohesion funds are encouraged to support investments aligned with climate objectives, accelerating efforts to ensure decarbonization drives growth for European industries. Member States are urged to invest in projects contributing to the climate and energy transition, with support for projects within the Strategic Energy Technology Plan (STEP) being made possible in all regions, including more developed ones, as allowed by state aid rules.

To provide a flexible financial support framework, the Commission proposes two new specific objectives within the ERDF. The first allows Member States to reprogram funds under their 2021-2027 programs to enhance productive capacities in the defense sector, without geographic or enterprise size restrictions. The second objective focuses on building resilient defense or dual-use infrastructure to improve military mobility in the EU.
