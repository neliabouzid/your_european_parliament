a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulation (EU) 2021/1057 establishing the European Social Fund + (ESF+) as regards specific measures to address strategic challenges  EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM  1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  The mid-term review of cohesion policy presents an opportunity for Member States to redirect 2021-2027 resources towards investment in defence capabilities, for the competitiveness, preparedness and strategic autonomy of the EU and in other emerging priorities, including clean industrial deal objectives by submitting corresponding programme amendments to the Commission. Strengthening these dimensions requires having people with the right skills. In the current demographic context, increasing skills and labour shortages are a main impediment for growth and economic adjustment. Investing in skills development and labour mobility is top priority.  The framework for cohesion policy investments in people set out in the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+) regulation is not sufficiently aligned with these new priorities. The exceptional challenges the Union is confronted with requires additional focus, flexibility and a reinforcement of incentives. The proposed adjustments will help steer reprogramming towards emerging priorities and will support speeding up implementation. This proposal sets out adjustments to the ESF+ regulation to achieve these objectives.  Aligning cohesion policy investments to new priorities  In recent years, geopolitical dynamics have been marked by profound uncertainty, necessitating a fundamental re-evaluation of the EU’s strategic autonomy. These shifts are unfolding alongside the green, social, and technological transitions, which are rapidly reshaping the world around us. The challenges posed by these simultaneous transformations were comprehensively analysed in the report on the “Future of European Competitiveness”, published in September 2024. The report underscores the urgent need to close the innovation gap, align decarbonisation efforts with economic competitiveness, and reduce external dependencies by diversifying supply chains and investing in critical sectors.  In response, several major initiatives have already been launched to enhance the EU’s economic resilience and strategic autonomy. These include the “Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform” (STEP), which aims to strengthen Europe’s technological leadership; “REPowerEU"", designed to reduce reliance on external energy sources and accelerate the green transition; to complete interventions already underway via cohesion policy programmes and the “Recovery and Resilience Facility” (RRF), to support structural changes in Member States and regions as well as to enhance their resilience.  As the EU’s main investment instrument within the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), cohesion policy plays a crucial role in supporting these priorities. It drives targeted investments that contribute to economic, social and territorial cohesion while at the same time addressing emerging challenges. It contributes to Europe’s economic transformation, including through innovation, strengthening competitiveness. However, the regulatory framework governing the 2021-2027 cohesion policy funds was drafted, negotiated and adopted before the series of major geopolitical and economic events that have since reshaped some of the EU’s strategic political priorities.  Similarly, the Partnership Agreements and the national and regional cohesion policy programmes were developed and approved within this same timeframe, hence reflecting the priorities set at the time. Given the evolving global and regional context, the 2025 mid-term review presents a critical opportunity to assess their implementation and the effectiveness of their contribution to the evolving priorities. This review will help determine the extent to which cohesion policy programmes can directly and swiftly respond to rapidly changing political, economic and social realities.  At the same time, it has become evident that the early implementation of the 2021-2027 cohesion policy programmes has faced challenges which have not been conducive to a swift uptake and rapid disbursement of the funds, leading to delays in their implementation compared to previous programming periods. These delays come at a time when strong and accelerated investment is essential to support economic resilience and competitiveness.  Against this backdrop, the Commission is proposing targeted amendments to Regulation (EU) 2021/1057. These changes aim to adjust investment priorities with the evolving economic, societal, environmental and geopolitical context while at the same time introducing greater flexibility and incentives to facilitate and encourage the rapid deployment of much-needed resources. By refining the 2021-2027 cohesion policy framework, the EU can ensure that its investment mechanisms remain agile and responsive, enabling a more effective response to current and future challenges.  In order for Member States to make effectively use of the possibilities provided in this proposal, they are proposed to be allowed to re-submit their mid-term review proposal by 2 months after the entry into force of the present proposal for amendment to Regulation (EU) 2021/1057. Any programme amendment that would be carried out pursuant to the new priorities and flexibilities, shall be without prejudice to the application of any measures adopted under Regulation 2020/2092 and to the compliance by relevant programmes with the priorities under Article 15 of Regulation 2021/1060. In this context the Commission will closely monitor the conformity of the programmes with the requirements of relevant EU law.  Adaptation of workers, enterprises and entrepeneurs to change contributing to decarbonisation and resilience of production capacities  Faced with high energy costs, fierce global competition and significant threats to the rules-based international order governing international trade, European industries need the adjust. They need workers with the right skills set, the definition of which is rapidly evolving. Ensuring that workers have access to obtaining the right skills through re- and upskilling measures and supporting mobility of (high skilled) workers between industries, as structural change is taking place at an unprecedented pace, requires immediate action.  Europe’s competitive strength lies in its people. Our human capital is key to the EU’s prosperity, its economic resilience to increasing our productivity growth, and to fostering cohesion . The EU's workforce must have the necessary skills to support the growing defence industry, strengthening Europe’s preparedness and security, as well as the transition to a low-carbon economy, including skills in clean technologies, digitalisation, and entrepreneurship. The Clean Industrial Deal 1 outlines concrete actions to turn decarbonisation into a driver of growth for European industries.  Defence and security  In the face of unprecedented geopolitical instability, the European Union must now make crucial decisions to ensure its security. To guarantee its own defence deterrence, and security, Europe must be prepared to enter a new era by significantly increasing its support for the development of the defence capabilities and the competitiveness of the EU defence industry. This effort will enable the Union to address the short-term urgency of supporting Ukraine while ensuring the continent’s long-term stability.  The Commission has proposed to the European Council an immediate response plan — REARM Europe — amounting to EUR 800 billion, by activating all available financial levers to swiftly and significantly support investment in European defence capacities. Among these levers, the Union budget can further contribute to this collective effort through a new dedicated defence instrument and the strengthening of the European Defence Industry Programme (EDIP).  To complement these tools and further incentivise Member States to directly support defence investments, it is essential that cohesion policy funding can be swiftly mobilised. These investments will reinforce the resilience and EU competitiveness while promoting regional development and growth. They will also tackle the dual challenge faced by the Union’s regions bordering Russia, Belarus and Ukraine: strengthening security while revitalising their economies.  The right skills are crucial to an effective defence capacity. The capacity of the defence industry to recruit skilled workers, and re- and upskill workers, is a sine qua non for the ability to ramp up production in a very short timeframe. The Union of Skills sets out actions to address skills gaps and shortages in Europe . The Commission will also develop a Skills Guarantee pilot. This scheme will offer workers involved in restructuring processes, or at risk of unemployment, the opportunity to develop further their careers in another company or another sector. This is particularly important in the present circumstances. Furthermore, the Pact for Skills, has established a large-scale partnership on the defence ecosystem 2 . Through skills forecasting, it supports collective anticipation of the skills gaps Europe will face, taking into account industry skills needs and demographic skills forecasts for the next five to ten years. It aims to upgrade upskilling and reskilling programmes to make them more attractive by better engaging and developing talent and improving its retention.  In this context, the ESF+ will actively facilitate the development of skills in the defence industry by providing additional flexibilities to implementation, including increased pre-financing, exemption from the calculation of thematic concentration as well as increased level of co-financing.  Eastern border regions  Given the challenges of the Eastern border regions since the Russian aggression against Ukraine, programmes under the Investment for jobs and growth goal with NUTS 2 regions that have borders with Russia, Belarus or Ukraine, should benefit from the possibility of a one-off 9.5% pre-financing of the programme allocation in 2026 and a 100% Union financing.  Greater flexibility and simplification for accelerating investments  Halfway in the 2021-2027 programming period, the level of payments claimed by the Member States to the Commission is low, owing to a combination of factors: the late adoption of the regulations governing the policy; the need to face successive crises from the COVID-19 pandemic to the war against Ukraine, and to the energy crisis; the pressure to close the previous programming period; and the priority given to implement the instruments of NGEU, given their shorter implementation timeframe. All this has in turn put a strain on the administrative capacities of Member States’ authorities to design and quickly deliver investments. Notwithstanding a rapid acceleration experienced over last year with project selection just above 40% of the allocations, cohesion policy implementation should rapidly pick up pace in a context where the Union is facing a range of new challenges requiring rapid responses. The Commission therefore proposes a set of measures aiming at further enhancing the flexibility and simplification of the use of cohesion policy support for accelerating investments:  – To avoid that programme implementation is delayed because of national budgetary constraints, and to expand the financial capacity Member States to address the newly emerging challenges, the Commission proposes to provide a one-off 4.5% pre-financing provided from the ESF+ in 2026 to all programmes that reallocate at least 15% of their resources for the new priorities and STEP in the context of the mid-term review process.  – The pre-financing percentage is proposed to be increased to 9.5% in 2026 for programmes covering one or more NUTS2 regions bordering Russia, Belarus or Ukraine acknowledging the specific challenges these regions have face since the Russian aggression in Ukraine .  – To avoid that the risk of delays and corresponding loss of funds reduces willingness to undertake programme amendments and to ensure the proper implementation of the operations concerned, the Commission proposes to extend the time limit for using the ESF+ resources and extend the end date for eligibility by an additional year. This flexibility is proposed to be made available only for programmes that proposed amendments resulting in reallocation of at least 15% of the resources for the new priorities and STEP in the context of the mid-term review exercise, once approved.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  The proposal is consistent with the objectives followed by the cohesion policy funds as well as with the latest Commission communication on a reform agenda for Cohesion policy and is limited to a targeted amendment of Regulation (EU) 2021/1057. Consistency with other Union policies  The proposal is limited to a targeted amendment of Regulation (EU) 2021/1057 and maintains consistency with other Union policies.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  The proposal is based on Articles 164, 175, 177 and 322 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  The proposal to encourage Member States to further align their cohesion policy programmes to addressing strategic challenges and to refocus resources to new priorities while ensuring greater flexibility to accelerate implementation, requires amendments to Regulation (EU) 2021/1057. The same result cannot be achieved through actions at national level.  • Proportionality  The proposal aims at incentivising Member States to further align their cohesion policy programmes to addressing strategic challenges and refocus resources to new priorities as well as providing greater flexibility for accelerating investments. The measures do not go beyond what is necessary to achieve these goals.  • Choice of the instrument  A Regulation is the appropriate instrument as it provides directly applicable rules for the support.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  N/A  • Stakeholder consultations  N/A  • Collection and use of expertise  N/A  • Impact assessment  An impact assessment has been carried out to prepare the proposal for Regulation (EU) 2021/1057. The limited and targeted changes do not require a separate impact assessment.  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  N/A  • Fundamental rights  N/A  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  The proposal concerns cohesion policy programmes from the 2021-2027 period and will result in additional pre-financing to be paid under the ESF+ in 2026. This additional pre-financing will lead to frontloading of payment appropriations to 2026 compared to a no policy-change scenario and is budgetary neutral over the 2021-2027 period. Based on the estimated uptake of the proposal as well as taking into account payment forecasts and implementation shifts , the net budgetary impact is estimated to EUR 500 million that will be included in the draft budget 2026.  The possibility to apply for an increased Union financing rate for investments under the dedicated priorities and for programmes covering Eastern border regions will also lead to a partial front-loading of payments, followed by lower payments at a later stage as the overall envelope is unchanged. The actual impact will highly depend on the Member States’ uptake.  The proposed modification does not require changes in the Multiannual Financial Framework annual ceilings for commitments and payments as per Annex I to Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2020/2093.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  The implementation of the measure will be monitored and reported upon in the framework of the general reporting mechanisms established in Regulation (EU) 2021/1060.  • Explanatory documents (for directives)  N/A  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  The proposal involves the amendment of Regulation (EU) 2021/1057 as regards the ESF+ in order to address strategic challenges and allow for Member States to refocus their resources to new priorities.  Defence  It allows for a focused support to development of skills in the defence industry under a dedicated priority that benefits from further flexibilities that include an increased pre-financing on the allocation of the priority, exemption from the calculation of amounts towards thematic concentration and an increased level of co-financing. Nevertheless, such flexibilities are conditioned to reallocating a minimum amount of the programme resources to new priorities.  Adaptation of workers, enterprises and entrepeneurs to change contributing to decarbonisation of production capacities  It allows for a focused support to skilling, up-skilling and re-skilling with a view to adaptation of workers, enterprises and entrepeneurs to change contributing to decarbonisation of production capacities.under a dedicated priority that benefits from further flexibilities that include an increased pre-financing on the allocation of the priority and increased level of co-financing. Nevertheless, such flexibilities are conditioned to reallocating a minimum amount of the programme resources to new priorities.  Facilitating the refocusing of resources by Member States  In order that the Member State could effectively make use of the new priorities and flexibilities, Member States will be allowed to re-submit their assessment to the mid-term review accompanied by a request for programme amendment to establish any of the newly introduced dedicated priorities.  To help accelerate the implementation of the ESF+, all programmes that establish any of the newly introduced dedicated priorities and STEP and reallocate at least 15% of their resources, would receive an additional one-off pre-financing of 4.5% on the basis of their amended programme budget.  Given the challenges of the Eastern border regions since the Russian aggression against Ukraine, programmes financed by the ESF+ with NUTS 2 regions that have borders with Russia, Belarus or Ukraine, should benefit from the possibility of a one-off 9.5% pre-financing and a 100% Union financing. Where the corresponding programme covers the entire territory of the Member State, these financial flexibilities should only apply if the programme covering the entire territory of the Member State is the only programme in the Member State that includes the concerned NUTS 2 regions.  In addition, the end-date for eligibility of expenditure is extended by one additional year for all cohesion policy programmes where programme amendments establishing any of the newly introduced dedicated priorities and reallocating at least 15% of the financial resources of the programme to those priorities have been approved.  2025/0085 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulation (EU) 2021/1057 establishing the European Social Fund + (ESF+) as regards specific measures to address strategic challenges  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 164, 175, 177  and Article 322thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 3 ,  Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions 4 ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) Given the major geopolitical and economic events that have reshaped some of the Union’s strategic political priorities, it is necessary to provide for possibilities for Member States to address those strategic challenges and to refocus their resources to newly emerging priorities.  (2) The W hite paper for European Defence – Readiness 2030 5 paves the way for a true European defence union , including by suggesting to Member States to heavily invest into defence and the defence industry. In that regard, the Communication from  the Commission - the Union of Skills of 5 March 2025 6 (‘the Union of Skills Communication’) sets out actions to address skills gaps and shortages in the Union , also through the Pact for Skills Initiative referred to in that Communication , and its large - scale partnerships, including one on the defence ecosystem. Therefore, it is appropriate to include incentives for the ESF+ established by Regulation (EU) 2021/1057 of the European Parliament and of the Council 7 to facilitate the development of skills in the defence industry.  (3) It is already possible to support the adaptation o f workers, entrepreneurs and enterprises to change under the ESF+ . In line with the decarbonisation measures proposed by the Communication from the Commission – the Clean Industrial Deal: A joint roadmap for competitiveness and decarbonisation of 26 February 2025 8 and t o further facilitate industrial adjustment linked to the decarbonisation of production processes and products, in the context of the objective of providing lifelong opportunities to regularly upskill and reskill people, as set out in the Union of Skills Communication, including through a newly proposed Skills Guarantee, the ESF+ should facilitate the skilling, job maintenance and job creation throughout the decarbonisation process by providing flexibilities to implementation.  (4) It is already possible, under ESF+, to support investments contributing to the objectives of the ‘Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform’ (STEP) established by Regulation (EU) 2024/795 of the European Parliament and of the Council 9 which aims to strengthen the Union’s technological leadership. In order to further incentivise investments from the ESF+ in those critical fields, the possibility for Member States to receive a higher pre-financing for related programme amendments should be extended.  (5) In order to enable Member States to carry out a meaningful reprogramming and focus resources on strategic Union priorities set out in recitals 2, 3 and 4 without causing further delays in implementation, it is appropriate to provide for further flexibilities. The mid-term review should serve as an opportunity to address emerging strategic challenges and new priorities therefore, Member States should benefit from additional time to complete the assessment of the outcome of the mid - term review and the submission of related programme amendments  (6) In order to accelerate the implementation of cohesion policy programmes and alleviate the pressure on national budgets and to inject the necessary liquidity for the implementation of key investments, an additional one-off pre-financing from the ESF+ should be paid for programmes. Because of the adverse impact of the Russian aggression in Ukraine, the pre-financing percentage should be further increased for certain programmes covering one or more NUTS2 regions bordering Russia, Belarus or Ukraine. In order to incentivise the re-programming towards key priorities in the context of the mid-term review , the additional pre-financing should only be available where a certain threshold for the reallocation of financial resources to specific crucial priorities is reached.  (7) Furthermore, to take account of the time needed to refocus investments and to allow best use of available resources, the deadlines for the eligibility of expenditure and the decommitment rules should be adjusted for programmes carrying out a reallocation of resources to strategic priorities.  (8) It should also be possible to apply a maximum co-financing rate of up to 100% to priorities in programmes covering one or more NUTS2 regions bordering Russia, Belarus or Ukraine, given the adverse impact of the Russian aggression on th o se regions.  (9) Since the objective s of this Regulation, namely to address strategic challenges, refocus investments on critical new priorities and simplify and accelerate policy delivery , cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union . In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.  (10) Regulation (EU) 2021/105 7 should therefore be amended accordingly .  (11) [ Given the urgen t need to enable crucial investments in skills in the defence industry as well as in adaptation to change linked to decarbonisation in the context of pressing strategic geopolitical challenges , this Regulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union ,]  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Article 1  Regulation (EU) 2021/1057 is amended as follows:  (1) the following Article 5a is inserted :  ‘ Article 5a  Specific provisions linked to the implementation of ESF+ strand under shared management  (1) In 2026, the Commission shall pay 4,5 % of the total support from the ESF+ as set out in the decision approving the programme amendment as additional one-off pre-financing.

Where, in a Member State, NUTS 2 regions bordering Russia, Belarus or Ukraine are included exclusively in programmes covering the entire territory of that Member State, the increased pre-financing set out in this paragraph shall apply to those programmes.  The additional pre-financing referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph shall only apply where reallocations of at least 15% of the financial resources of the programme to one or more dedicated priorities established in accordance with  Articles 12a, 12c and 12d have been approved; provided that the request for a programme amendment is submitted by 31 December 2025.  The pre-financing due to the Member State which results from programme amendments pursuant to reallocation to the priorities referred to in the second subparagraph of this paragraph shall be counted  as payments made in 2025 for the purposes of calculating the amounts to be de-committed in accordance with Article 105 of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 , provided the request for programme amendment was submitted in 2025.  (2) By way of derogation from Article 63(2) and Article 105(2) of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060, the deadline for the eligibility of expenditure, the reimbursement of costs as well as for decommitment shall be 31 December 2030.

(3) By way of derogation from Article 112 of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060, the maximum co-financing rate for priorities in programmes covering one or more NUTS2 regions bordering Russia, Belarus or Ukraine shall be 100 %. The higher co-financing rate shall not apply to programmes covering the entire territory of the Member State concerned, unless those regions are included only in programmes covering the entire territory of that Member State. The derogation shall only apply where reallocations of at least 15% of the financial resources of the programme to one or more dedicated priorities established in accordance with Articles 12a, 12c and 12d of this Regulation in the context of the mid-term review have been approved, provided that the programme amendment is submitted by 31 December 2025.  (4) In addition to the assessment for each programme on the outcome of the mid-term review to be submitted in accordance with Article 18(2) of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060, Member States may resubmit a complementary  assessment as well as related requests for programme amendments, taking into account the  possibility for dedicated priorities in accordance with Articles 12a, 12c and 12d  within 2 months of the entry into force of  Regulation (EU) XXXX/XXXX [this Regulation]. The deadlines set out in Article 18 (3) of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 shall apply.

FRAMEWORK OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE  1.1. Title of the proposal/initiative  Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL amending Regulation (EU) 2021/1057 as regards specific measures to address strategic challenges  1.2. Policy area(s) concerned  Cohesion policy: European Social Fund Plus (ESF+)  1.3. Objective(s)  1.3.1. General objective(s)  The cohesion policy funds, including the ESF+, provide financing in support of the harmonious development of the EU, through actions that lead to the strengthening of its economic, social and territorial cohesion. In support of this overarching objective, the Funds also contribute to advancing key policy objectives, including strengthening the overall competitiveness and the strategic autonomy of the EU, and addressing challenges and opportunities that are associated with the green, digital and social transitions.  1.3.2. Specific objective(s)  Specific objective No 1  Accelerate the implementation of 2021-2027 cohesion policy programmes financed by the ESF+ by enhancing the flexibility and provide areas of simplification for the use of cohesion policy funds.  Specific objective No 2  Provide support from the ESF+ under the 2021-2027 programmes to development of skills in the defence industry as a short-term reaction to recent geopolitical events by providing additional possibilities for Member States to refocus resources to the defence sector.  Further facilitate industrial adjustment linked to the decarbonisation of production processes and products by providing additional possibilities for Member States to refocus resources to skilling, up-skilling and re-skilling with a view to adaptation of workers, enterprises and entrepreneurs to change throughout the decarbonisation process.  Address specific territorial challenges of the Regions bordering Ukraine, Russia and Belarus.  1.3.3. Expected result(s) and impact  Specify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.  Specific objective No 1  Maximising the use of the resources allocated to the ESF+ under the 2021-2027 MFF.  Specific objective No 2  Increased level of skills matching the demand of the defence industry as well as in sectors affected by the decarbonisation process.  Increased support to address the specific challenges of regions bordering Russia, Belarus and Ukraine.  1.3.4. Indicators of performance  Specify the indicators for monitoring progress and achievements.  Specific objective No 1  Financial data on the amounts related to operations selected and implemented by Member States and on disbursements made from the EU budget to Member States.  Specific objective No 2  Common Output Indicator – Total number of participants  1.4. The proposal/initiative relates to:   a new action  X a new action following a pilot project / preparatory action 10   the extension of an existing action   a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action  1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative  1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative  Recent economic and geopolitical events have brought to the front important priorities that require refocusing of resources within cohesion policy, notably in the ESF+. The specific actions within the scope of this amendment are already possible to be financed under the current legal framework governing the ESF+. Therefore, they are already in line with the overall objective of strengthening economic, social and territorial cohesion. However, the pace and volume of investments need to be increased. The ongoing mid-term review of the 2021-2027 cohesion policy programmes provides a crucial opportunity to assess how these programmes can help deliver on the newly emerging priorities. Therefore, the current amendment creates incentives and flexibilities to allow Member States to put a greater focus with resources from the MFF on these priorities within a relatively short time frame.  1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, great er effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this section 'added value of EU involvement' is the value resulting from EU action, that is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.  The amendment is designed to allow Member States to direct necessary cohesion policy funding to investments in policy areas that have been identified as priorities, and to maintain and strengthen the economic, social and territorial cohesion of the EU.  Specific objective 1:  Cohesion policy funding is vital for economic stability, fairness, and integration in the EU. It plays a primary role in reducing regional disparities and ensuring balanced development across all Member States. It ensures that all regions have the resources to grow, innovate, and adapt to future challenges while promoting EU-wide solidarity. Maintaining and accelerating the flow of funds to the Member States from the EU budget is essential for ensuring the necessary level of public funding in Member States and to achieve the cohesion objectives enshrined in the Treaty.  Specific objective 2:  Development of skills in the defence industry : The Versailles Declaration of March 2022, as well as communications JOIN(2022) 24 and COM(2022) 60 already outlined the need for the EU to step up its own preparedness, capability and resilience to better protect its citizens. The rapidly evolving geopolitical context of the past months has emphasised the need to step up the efforts. The European Council conclusions of 6 March 2025 stress “that Europe must become more sovereign, more responsible for its own defence and better equipped to act and deal autonomously with immediate and future challenges and threats with a 360° approach”. To that end, the EU will accelerate the mobilisation of the necessary instruments and financing. The European Council “calls on the Commission to propose additional funding sources for defence at EU level, including by means of additional possibilities and incentives offered to all Member States, on the basis of the principles of objectivity, non-discrimination and equal treatment of Member States, in the use of their current allocations under the relevant EU funding programmes, and to swiftly present relevant proposals”.  Adaptation of workers, entrepreneurs and enterprises to change throughout the decarbonisation process: Strengthening the competitiveness and resilience in strategic sectors and reducing the dependencies of the European economy through the green and digital transformations has been the EU compass over the last years. The proposal gives further impetus to use the scale of the EU to invest in areas important for the EU’s future competitiveness.  1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past  Recent amendments to the 2014-2020 and 2021-2027 Regulations in the context of the COVID-19 crisis, the military aggression of Russia in Ukraine, the energy crisis, and competitiveness (STEP) have resulted in an important uptake of funds to support relevant investments.  1.5.4. Compatibility with the multiannual financial framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments  The amendment does not alter the existing cohesion policy allocations and is intended to help accelerate investments of the Funds in an efficient and effective manner.  1.5.5. Assessment of the different available financing options, including scope for redeployment  The amendment does not alter the core structure of the existing cohesion policy regulatory framework, including for the ESF+, nor does it alter the fixed Member State allocations. It is intended to emphasise and incentivise support to measures that are already possible within the scope of the ESF+ and that are complementary to investments through other financing options either at EU level or at Member State level.  1.6. Duration of the proposal/initiative and of its financial impact  X limited duration  –  financial impact from 2026 to 2029 for payment appropriations. No impact on  commitment appropriations.  1.7. Method(s) of budget implementation planned 11  –  Shared management with the Member States  Comments  2. MANAGEMENT MEASURES  2.1. Monitoring and reporting rules  The monitoring and reporting rules laid down in Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 remain fully applicable:  Programme monitoring committee: minimum once a year  Annual performance review between the Member State and the Commission  Data transmission per programme: five times per year  Annual control (audit) report.  A final performance report for each programme needs to be submitted by 15 February 2031  2.2. Management and control system(s)  2.2.1. Justification of the budget implementation method(s), the funding implementation mechanism(s), the payment modalities and the control strategy proposed  The proposal for amendment does not alter the existing shared management budget implementation method, nor does it change the implementation mechanisms, the payment modalities or the control strategies defined in Regulation (EU) 2021/1060.  2.2.2. Information concerning the risks identified and the internal control system(s) set up to mitigate them  No specific risks have been identified. The proposal for amendment does not structurally alter the risk-management and control setup of the cohesion policy programmes, which is considered appropriate for the envisaged investments.  2.2.3. Estimation and justification of the cost-effectiveness of the controls (ratio between the control costs  and the value of the related funds managed), and assessment of the expected levels of risk of error (at payment & at closure)  The control framework of cohesion policy remains unchanged and fully applicable. This has been designed to protect the financial interests of the EU and adjusted over multiple programming periods to take into account the recommendations of ECA and OLAF.  2.3. Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities  Member States need to comply with the existing cohesion policy control framework, and need to have in place a management and control system that allows for the prevention, detection and correction and reporting on irregularities, including fraud.  3.

of 18 September 2025
amending Regulation (EU) 2021/1057 establishing the European Social FundPlus(ESF+) as regards specific measures to address strategic challenges
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 164, 175, 177 and 322 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions(2),
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure(3),
Whereas:
(1) Given recent major geopolitical and economic events that have reshaped some of the Union’s strategic political priorities, it is necessary to provide for more structural possibilities to allow Member States to address those pressing strategic geopolitical challenges and to refocus their resources on newly emerging priorities.
(2) The main objectives of the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+), established by means of Regulation (EU) 2021/1057 of the European Parliament and of the Council(4), are to support Member States and regions to achieve social inclusion and social cohesion, to activate the labour market, and to deliver on the principles and the headline targets of the European Pillar of Social Rights. The reprogramming of resources under the ESF+ should not undermine its social approach, but should strengthen its capacity to combat inequality.
(3) In its opinion of 6 May 2025 on the legislative proposal forming the basis for this Regulation, the European Court of Auditors stressed that cohesion policy is often used as an emergency response tool, which risks undermining its primary longer-term aims and objectives. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that any measures taken in the context of emergencies do not obstruct the objectives of cohesion policy.
(4) The Union and its Member States continue to show that they are able to react rapidly to geopolitical events and that they are willing to use sufficient financial resources towards strengthening the defence industry of the Union. At the same time, it is of utmost importance to continue to invest in the social objectives of the Union through the ESF+, as social cohesion is a cornerstone of the Union’s democratic and societal resilience, which is essential for the purpose of facing threats of aggression.
(5) The Joint White Paper of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the Commission of 19 March 2025 on European Defence – Readiness 2030 paves the way for a true European defence union, including by suggesting to Member States to heavily invest in defence and cybersecurity, including dual-use capabilities and civil preparedness, which should be carried out together with social spending, creating employment and up-skilling and re-skilling opportunities. In that regard, the Commission communication of 5 March 2025 entitled ‘The Union of Skills’ (the ‘Union of Skills Communication’) sets out actions to address skills gaps and skills shortages in the Union, including through the strengthened and streamlined Pact for Skills, referred to in that communication, as well as its large-scale partnerships in particular the Large Scale Partnership for Aerospace and Defence. In that context, it is appropriate to incorporate incentives into the ESF+ with a view to facilitating the development of skills in the defence industry. In order to provide more flexibility for Member States to reallocate resources to the development of skills in the defence industry, the amounts allocated to such development should not be subject to thematic concentration requirements, but should be taken into account when contributing to such requirements.
(6) The ESF+ can be used to support the adaptation of workers, enterprises and entrepreneurs to change. In line with the decarbonisation measures proposed in the Commission communication of 26 February 2025 entitled ‘The Clean Industrial Deal: A joint roadmap for competitiveness and decarbonisation’ and in order to further facilitate industrial adjustment linked to the decarbonisation of production processes and products, the ESF+ should facilitate skilling, job maintenance and quality job creation throughout the decarbonisation process, by providing flexibility in the implementation of that process. This should be carried out in line with the objective of providing lifelong opportunities to regularly upskill and reskill people set out in the Union of Skills Communication, including through a Skills Guarantee. Particular consideration should be given to the specific needs and circumstances of less developed regions and rural areas, which should benefit from the green transition, and to ensuring their integration into the Union’s broader economic, social and environmental development.
(7) In light of the importance of horizontal enabling conditions applicable to all specific objectives and the criteria necessary for the assessment of their fulfilment, within the meaning of Article 15(1), second subparagraph, of and Annex III to Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 of the European Parliament and of the Council(5), for the effective and efficient use of the overall Union support granted by those Union Funds and the need to ensure the practical effect of those Union Funds, the amounts exceeding the flexibility amount referred to in Article 86(1), second subparagraph, of that Regulation, which correspond to specific objectives that are subject to a negative assessment by the Commission on the basis of the application of those horizontal enabling conditions, should not be subject to a programme amendment or transfer on the basis of the new priorities and flexibility provided for in this Regulation. Such a proportionate measure constitutes a necessary incentive, intended to ensure that Member State law and practice continues to comply with the horizontal enabling conditions and that the expenditure covered by the Union Funds meets the Union’s objectives. Since Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2020/2092 of the European Parliament and of the Council(6)is of horizontal application, the same requirement should apply to the amounts corresponding to commitments suspended by measures adopted on the basis of that Regulation. Amounts within the flexibility amount referred to in Article 86(1), second subparagraph, of Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 and corresponding to the specific objectives subject to a negative assessment by the Commission on the basis of the application of the horizontal enabling conditions can be subject to a programme amendment or transfer on the basis of new priorities, provided that such new priorities comply with the objectives pursued by the horizontal enabling conditions.
(8) The ESF+ provides for support for investments contributing to the objectives of the Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (STEP), which was established by Regulation (EU) 2024/795 of the European Parliament and of the Council(7). STEP aims to strengthen the Union’s technological leadership and the development of skills in the Union. In order to provide further incentives for investments from the ESF+ in those critical fields, the possibility for Member States to receive higher pre-financing for related programme amendments should be extended. The priorities which support investments contributing to STEP objectives under a request for a programme amendment that was submitted to the Commission by 31 March 2025 are to receive the exceptional one-off pre-financing applicable at the time of the submission of that request.
(9) In order to enable Member States to carry out meaningful and just reprogramming, without diverging from the main objectives of the ESF+, and to focus resources on the strategic Union priorities referred to in this Regulation, without causing further delays in the implementation of programmes, it is appropriate to provide for further flexibility. The mid-term review serves as an opportunity to address emerging social aspects of strategic challenges and new priorities without prejudice to other Union legal acts or to the next multiannual financial framework. Member States should benefit from additional time to complete their assessment of the outcome of the mid-term review and their submission of related requests for programme amendments.
(10) Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine is having a disproportionately heavy impact on NUTS level 2 regions bordering Russia, Belarus or Ukraine, resulting in job losses, less economic activity and social exclusion. In order to accelerate the implementation of cohesion policy programmes and alleviate the pressure on national budgets as well as to inject the liquidity necessary for the implementation of key investments, an additional one-off pre-financing payment from the ESF+ should be paid for programmes. Because of the adverse impact of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, the pre-financing percentage should be further increased for certain programmes covering one or more NUTS level 2 regions bordering Russia, Belarus or Ukraine. In order to encourage re-programming towards key priorities in the context of the mid-term review, the additional one-off pre-financing should be available only where a certain threshold for the reallocation of financial resources to specific crucial priorities is reached.
(11) Furthermore, to take account of the time needed to refocus investments and to allow the best use of available resources, the deadlines for the eligibility of expenditure and the decommitment rules as well as other deadlines related to the performance framework, financial management, reporting and evaluation requirements should be adjusted for programmes carrying out a reallocation of resources to strategic priorities.
(12) It should be possible to apply a higher co-financing rate to priorities in programmes covering one or more NUTS level 2 regions bordering Russia, Belarus or Ukraine, given the adverse impact of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine on those NUTS level 2 regions.
(13) Skills development and the training of young talent as well as entrepreneurs are essential for job creation, and institutions working on skills creation and uptake, in particular vocational education and training institutes, should cooperate closely to align with labour market needs. In that context, Member States should also be able to allocate resources to attract young talent and entrepreneurs, particularly to rural and less developed regions, through incentives and targeted training.
(14) When amending programmes, the Member States should include, in relation to the dedicated priorities, with the close and meaningful participation of the social partners, obligations on the beneficiaries to respect working and employment conditions in accordance with the applicable Union and national law, conventions of the International Labour Organization and collective agreements.
(15) To support Member States in their swift and correct reprogramming, the Commission should provide timely and clear technical clarifications and support to managing authorities, including through a structured system, by answering technical, legal and procedural questions, in particular with regard to measures introduced by this Regulation.
(16) Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely to address the social aspects of strategic challenges, refocus investments on critical new priorities and simplify and accelerate policy delivery, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
(17) Regulation (EU) 2021/1057 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(18) Given the urgent need to enable crucial investments in skills in the defence industry as well as in adaptation to change linked to decarbonisation in the context of pressing strategic geopolitical challenges, this Regulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication in theOfficial Journal of the European Union,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

Done at Brussels, 18 September 2025.",https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202501913,"The European Commission has proposed amendments to the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+) regulation to better align it with the EU's strategic priorities, addressing challenges such as geopolitical shifts, the green transition, and technological advancements. This proposal, submitted to the European Parliament, aims to enhance the EU's economic resilience and strategic autonomy by allowing Member States to redirect resources towards new priorities, including defense capabilities, clean industrial deals, and skills development to tackle labor shortages. The mid-term review of the cohesion policy offers an opportunity to reassess and adjust the implementation of these funds to better respond to current challenges, emphasizing the need for greater flexibility and incentives to accelerate the deployment of resources.

The proposal highlights the importance of equipping Europe's workforce with the necessary skills to support the growing defense industry and the transition to a low-carbon economy. This includes skills in clean technologies, digitalization, and entrepreneurship. In response to geopolitical instability, the EU is considering a significant increase in support for defense capabilities, including a proposed EUR 800 billion response plan, REARM Europe, to bolster European defense capacities. The ESF+ will facilitate the development of skills in the defense industry by providing additional flexibilities, such as increased pre-financing and co-financing.

For Eastern border regions affected by the Russian aggression against Ukraine, the proposal suggests a one-off 9.5% pre-financing of program allocations in 2026 with 100% Union financing. This pre-financing is intended to be paid within 60 days"

7.3.2025  COM(2025) 106 final  2025/0058(COD)  Proposal for a  DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Council Directive 92/43/EEC as regards the protection status of the wolf (Canis lupus)  EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM  1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  On 6 December 2024, the Standing Committee of the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats (the Bern Convention) adopted the European Union’s proposal to change the protection status of the wolf ( Canis lupus ) by moving the species from Appendix II (strictly protected fauna species) to Appendix III (protected fauna species).  That decision entered into force three months later, in line with the procedure set out in Article 17 of the Bern Convention. Following its entry into force and in order to transpose this change under the Bern Convention, it is necessary to amend the annexes of Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora (the Habitats Directive) by moving reference to the species from Annex IV of the Directive to Annex V.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  The legal basis for this proposal is Article 192(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which sets out how the objectives referred to in Article 191 of the Treaty should be implemented.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  To transpose the changes under the Bern Convention into EU legislation, it is necessary to amend the Habitats Directive, which is one of the main instruments for implementing the international obligations of the EU under the Convention. This targeted amendment complies with the subsidiarity requirements.  • Proportionality  The proposed amendment relates solely to the effects of the decision of the Standing Committee of the Bern Convention to change the protection status of the wolf. Therefore, this proposal is strictly limited to the changes to the Habitats Directive that give effect to that decision at EU level. Specifically, it is a limited, targeted amendment to Annex IV and Annex V, solely concerning the wolf.  • Choice of the instrument  As the Habitats Directive transposes the Bern Convention’s provisions on the protection status of the wolf into EU law, it is appropriate to incorporate any changes to the protection of that species into the Habitats Directive through an amending Directive, via the ordinary legislative procedure.  3. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  The monitoring and reporting provisions of the Habitats Directive are not affected by this proposal.  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  Article 12 of the Habitats Directive sets out prohibitions concerning the deliberate capture or killing, deliberate disturbance, and deterioration or destruction of breeding sites or resting places. With this amendment, this strict protection would cease to apply to the wolf.  The wolf would then be subject to the protection set out in Article 14 of the Habitats Directive. Article 14 requires Member States to take measures to ensure that the taking in the wild of specimens of species of wild fauna and flora listed in Annex V as well as their exploitation is compatible with maintaining them at a favourable conservation status.  As with Article 12, Member States may derogate from the requirements of Article 14 provided they satisfy the requirements set out in Article 16 of the Directive.  Proposal for a  DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Council Directive 92/43/EEC as regards the protection status of the wolf ( Canis lupus )  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192(1) thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 1 ,  Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions 2 ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) For the reasons set out in Council Decision (EU) 2024/2669 3 , the Union submitted a proposal to the Standing Committee of the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats 4 (the Bern Convention) to lower the protection level of the wolf species under the Bern Convention . At its 44th meeting o n 6 December 2024, the Standing Committee approved the proposal of the Union to move the wolf ( Canis lupus ) from Appendix II ( ‘ S trictly protected fauna species’ ) to the Bern Convention to Appendix III ( ‘ P rotected fauna species’ ) to the Convention .  (2) In line with Article 17(3) of the Bern Convention, th e change to the protection status of the wolf entered into force on 7 March 2025, three months after the decision of the Standing Committee.  (3) Council Directive 92/43/EEC 5 is a key instrument for the conservation of nature in the Union, particularly in view of the Union’s international obligations under the Bern Convention. For the change to the protection status of the wolf to be transposed into the legal framework of the Union , t he decision of the Standing Committee should be reflected in Directive 92/43/EEC.  (4) Transposing the decision of the Standing Committee requires moving reference to the wolf from Annex IV to Directive 92/43/EEC to Annex V to that Directive, which makes the wolf subject to the protection provided for in Article 14 of Directive 92/43/EEC .  (5) Directive 92/43/EEC aims to contribute to ensuring biodiversity through the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora in the European territory of the Member States to which the Treaty applies.  (6) Directive 92/43/EEC is an instrument in the field of environment, which permits Member States to maintain or introduce more stringent protective measures as long as they are compatible with the Treaties, as provided for in Article 193 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Therefore, for the purposes of Directive 92/43/EEC, Member States remain free to maintain a strict level of protection for the wolf.  (7) Directive 92/43/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly,  HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:  Article 1  Directive 92/43/EEC is amended as follows:  in Annex IV, the following paragraph is deleted:  ‘ Canis lupus (except the Greek populations north of the 39th parallel; Estonian populations, Spanish populations north of the Duero; Bulgarian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Polish, Slovak populations and Finnish populations within the reindeer management area as defined in paragraph 2 of the Finnish Act No 848/90 of 14 September 1990 on reindeer management)’;  in Annex V, the following paragraph:  ‘ Canis lupus (Spanish populations north of the Duero, Greek populations north of the 39th parallel, Finnish populations within the reindeer management area as defined in paragraph 2 of the Finnish Act No 848/90 of 14 September 1990 on reindeer management, Bulgarian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Estonian, Polish and Slovak populations)’  is replaced with the following:  ‘ Canis lupus ’.  Article 2  1. Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by […] [OP please insert date = 18 months after date of entry into force of th is Directive] . They shall forthwith communicate to the Commission the text of those provisions.  When Member States adopt those provisions, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or be accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication. Member States shall determine how such reference is to be made.  2. Member States shall communicate to the Commission the text of the main provisions of national law that they adopt in the field covered by this Directive.  Article 3  This Directive shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union .  Article 4  This Directive is addressed to the Member States.

(As an agreement was reached between Parliament and Council, Parliament's position corresponds to the final legislative act, Directive (EU) 2025/1237.)",,"DIRECTIVE (EU) 2025/1237 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL
of 17 June 2025
amending Council Directive 92/43/EEC as regards the protection status of the wolf (Canis lupus)
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192(1) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee(1),
After consulting the Committee of the Regions,
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure(2),
Whereas:
(1) For the reasons set out in Council Decision (EU) 2024/2669(3), the Union submitted a proposal to the Standing Committee of the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats(4)(the ‘Bern Convention’) to change the protection status of the wolf species under that Convention. At its 44th meeting on 6 December 2024, the Standing Committee approved the proposal of the Union to move the wolf (Canis lupus) from Appendix II (‘Strictly protected fauna species’) to the Bern Convention to Appendix III (‘Protected fauna species’) to that Convention (‘the decision of the Standing Committee’).
(2) In accordance with Article 17(3) of the Bern Convention, the change to the protection status of the wolf entered into force on 7 March 2025.
(3) Council Directive 92/43/EEC(5)is a key instrument for the conservation of nature in the Union, particularly in view of the Union’s international obligations under the Bern Convention. For the change to the protection status of the wolf under the Bern Convention to be transposed into the legal framework of the Union, the decision of the Standing Committee should be reflected in Directive 92/43/EEC.
(4) In order to transpose the decision of the Standing Committee, the entry for the wolf should be deleted from Annex IV to Directive 92/43/EEC and adjusted in Annex V to that Directive, thereby providing the wolf with the protection provided for in Article 14 of Directive 92/43/EEC.
(5) Directive 92/43/EEC aims to contribute to ensuring biodiversity through the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora in the European territory of the Member States to which the Treaty applies.
(6) Directive 92/43/EEC, as an instrument in the field of the environment, permits Member States to maintain or introduce more stringent protective measures as long as they are compatible with the Treaties, as provided for in Article 193 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Therefore, for the purposes of Directive 92/43/EEC, Member States remain free, notwithstanding the amendment introduced by this Directive, to maintain the protection status of the wolf at the level of protection provided to strictly protected fauna species.
(7) Since the objective of this Directive can only be achieved at Union level, because it requires amending an existing Union legal act, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.
(8) Directive 92/43/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:

Article 1

Directive 92/43/EEC is amended as follows:
(1) in Annex IV, point (a), ‘Animals’, the entry for the speciesCanis lupusis deleted;
(2) in Annex V, point (a), ‘Animals’, the entry for the speciesCanis lupusis replaced by the following:‘Canis lupus’.

Article 2

1.   Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 15 January 2027. They shall immediately inform the Commission thereof.
When Member States adopt those measures, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or shall be accompanied by such reference on the occasion of their official publication. The methods of making such reference shall be laid down by Member States.
2.   Member States shall communicate to the Commission the text of the main measures of national law which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive.

Article 3

This Directive shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in theOfficial Journal of the European Union.

Article 4

This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
Done at Strasbourg, 17 June 2025.",https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202501237,"The European Commission has proposed an amendment to the Habitats Directive to align with a recent decision by the Standing Committee of the Bern Convention, which oversees wildlife conservation in Europe. This decision has reclassified the protection status of the wolf (Canis lupus) from ""strictly protected"" to ""protected."" As a result, the EU must update its legislation, moving the wolf from Annex IV, which lists species requiring strict protection, to Annex V, where species are protected but can be subject to certain conditions. This change means that while the wolf remains protected, the strict prohibitions against its capture, killing, and disturbance will be relaxed. Instead, the wolf will be subject to regulations ensuring its conservation status remains favorable, allowing for some controlled activities under specific conditions.

The proposal reflects the EU's commitment to fulfilling its international obligations under the Bern Convention and involves consultation with national parliaments and various EU bodies. Member States are allowed to maintain or introduce more stringent protective measures for the wolf if they are compatible with EU treaties. The directive will come into effect 20 days after its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union, with Member States required to implement necessary laws and regulations within 18 months. This legislative change aims to contribute to biodiversity conservation by adjusting the legal framework governing the protection of the wolf in Europe.

Regarding the budget, the proposal does not anticipate any financial impact. There is no provision for co-financing by third parties, and the proposal has no financial impact on revenue. Additionally"

carbon border adjustment mechanism  (Text with EEA relevance)  {SWD(2025) 58 final}  EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM  1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  In his report on ‘The Future of European Competitiveness’, Mario Draghi emphasised the need for Europe to create a regulatory landscape which facilitates competitiveness and resilience 1 . In the Budapest Declaration on the New European Competitiveness Deal, EU Heads of State and Government called for ‘a simplification revolution, ensuring a clear, simple and smart regulatory framework for businesses and drastically reducing administrative, regulatory and reporting burdens, in particular for SMEs’ 2 . Multiple companies and stakeholders have voiced their concerns about the administrative burden resulting from a number of EU acts, including Regulation (EU) 2023/956 establishing a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (‘CBAM Regulation’) 3 .  In its Communication on the Competitive Compass for the EU, the Commission confirmed that it would deliver an unprecedented simplification effort to achieve the agreed policy objectives in the simplest, most targeted, most effective and least burdensome way. In its Communication entitled ‘A simpler and faster Europe: Communication on implementation and simplification’, the Commission set out an implementation and simplification agenda that delivers fast and visible improvements for people and business on the ground, requiring more than an incremental approach and underlining the need for bold action to streamline and simplify EU, national and regional rules 4 .  Administrative requirements, including reporting requirements, play a key role in ensuring correct enforcement and proper monitoring of legislation. Generally, their costs are largely offset by the benefits they bring. However, reporting requirements can also impose disproportionate burdens on stakeholders, particularly affecting small and medium-sized enterprises and micro-companies.  This proposal will deliver simplifications and cost-efficient improvements to the CBAM Regulation without affecting the achievement of objectives in this policy area. The proposed measures will not undermine the environmental objective of CBAM, rather the measures will enable a more efficient CBAM while the key design principles of the mechanism will remain unchanged.  The proposal will make it easier for importers of goods into the Union to comply with CBAM reporting obligations by simplifying some of those CBAM reporting requirements which rely on complex calculations and data collection processes which would hamper the CBAM’s effective implementation.  In addition, the proposal will strengthen the monitoring and supervision of CBAM. It will increase the ability of the Commission to process data and exchange relevant information with national authorities to ensure that the utility of the information reported by stakeholders is maximised. It will also enable the Commission to better detect risks and the national competent authorities to be better equipped to take appropriate actions where needed  Finally, simplifying the mechanism will also be a key enabler for a potential future scope extension. In the second half of 2025, the Commission will present a comprehensive CBAM review report as provided in Article 30 of the CBAM regulation, which will pave the way for a potential extension of the CBAM scope.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  This proposal is part of a package of measures aiming at simplifying reporting requirements, by looking comprehensively at existing requirements, with a view to assess their continued relevance and to make them more efficient. It builds on existing rules from the CBAM Regulation, Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/1773 of 17 August 2023 laying down the reporting obligations for the transitional period 5 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2024/3210 of 18 December 2024 laying down rules for the CBAM registry 6 .  • Consistency with other Union policies  The proposal is consistent with the objectives of the better regulation agenda, as it will strengthen the Commission’s ability to carry out its general supervision of CBAM, while avoiding the costs (both for the Commission and the entities providing the information) that would otherwise be incurred in collecting the information through other means.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  The proposal amends an existing regulation. Therefore, the legal basis for the proposal is the same as the legal basis of the amended Regulation, namely Article 192(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (‘TFEU’) in the area of environment protection.  In accordance with Articles 191 and 192(1) of TFEU, the Union shall contribute to the pursuit, inter alia, of the following objectives: preserving, protecting and improving the quality of the environment, promoting measures at international level to deal with regional or worldwide environmental problems, and in particular combating climate change.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  The CBAM Regulation created a common uniform framework ensuring an equivalence between the carbon pricing policy applied in the EU’s internal market and the carbon pricing policy applied on imports.  The simplifications to that regulation envisaged by this proposal will further enhance legal certainty and rationalise the reporting requirements.  • Proportionality  The simplification of administrative requirements, including reporting requirements, simplifies the legal framework by introducing changes to existing requirements that do not affect the substance of the policy objectives. The proposal is therefore limited to those changes that are necessary to decrease the compliance burden and to ensure compliance in a more efficient manner without changing the substance of the legislation concerned.  The proposal is consistent with the principle of proportionality as it does not go beyond what is necessary to meet the objectives of the Treaties. The proportionality of the proposal has a number of important aspects.  Firstly, it is recognised that it is challenging for importers to deal with the CBAM reporting requirements while at the same time Member States’ competent authorities must carry out important supervision tasks. This will be mitigated by introducing a threshold to exempt from CBAM obligations certain importers.  Secondly, for importers within the CBAM scope, the proposal contains changes to the reporting requirements, targeting those which are necessary to decrease the compliance burden and ensure compliance in a more efficient manner.  • Choice of the instrument  The proposal requires amending the CBAM Regulation. It lays down the specific rules necessary for the simplified application of certain provisions of the CBAM Regulation, where the goals pursued cannot be reached through the adoption of implementing measures as they require amending basic provisions of the CBAM Regulation. This concerns the de minimis derogation, the reporting obligations, the calculation of embedded emissions and the calculation of the financial adjustment.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  The proposal relies on the experience gained in implementing the CBAM Regulation since the mechanism started to apply in its transitional phase on 1 October 2023.  • Stakeholder consultations  Since the CBAM started to apply in its transitional phase on 1 October 2023, the Commission Services have continuously been consulting stakeholders in the Union and in third countries relevant for CBAM via multiple communication channels. In 2023, the Commission Services renewed the mandate of the expert group on CBAM 7 whose mission is to assist the Commission services in the development and implementation of the CBAM, harness technical expertise and bring exchanges of experience and good practices in CBAM implementation.  In 2023, the Commission Services also launched a broad communication campaign to raise awareness about CBAM including in third countries , explain the rules and provide useful advice in how CBAM could be implemented by the relevant stakeholders (such as importers, third country producers, national authorities). This communication campaign relied on publicly available live webinars in several EU languages. Useful materials have been provided on the CBAM-dedicated webpage 8 : targeted e-learning materials, Q&A, guidance (also translated to non-EU official languages).  The Commission was also in regular contact with national competent authorities for CBAM, to discuss various issues concerning implementation of CBAM, with a view to improve its functioning and effectiveness.  On 6 February 2025, the Commission hosted a high-level consultation day with key stakeholders to test the main ideas of the legislative package on simplification on targeted policies, including the CBAM, and to collect input and feedback ahead of its adoption on 26 February 2025.  Based on these actions and repeated public meetings with relevant business representatives from the Union and third countries, the Commission Services have collected sufficient feedback from stakeholders to adopt the best measures to achieve the objective of the proposal: simplify the complex reporting rules to reduce the compliance burden and ensure CBAM is efficiently rolled out while preserving its environmental objective and climate objective.  • Collection and use of expertise  The proposal has been elaborated following a process of internal scrutiny of existing reporting obligations and is based on experience in implementing the related legislation, including the data collected through the quarterly CBAM report submitted by declarants. Since this is a step in the process of continuous assessment of reporting requirements in Union legislations, the scrutiny of such burdens and of their impact on stakeholders will continue in the future.  • Impact assessment  The proposal concerns targeted changes of the CBAM Regulation to simplify some of its requirements, including reporting. The main measures are based on experience in implementing this Regulation and abovementioned related implementing acts. The proposed targeted changes ensure a more efficient and effective implementation of the existing mechanism.  This proposal is accompanied by an analytical document , the Commission Staff Working Document (SWD) “Towards a simpler and more effective Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism” 9 . The analytical document builds on and further complements the analysis carried out in the original impact assessment conducted in 2021.  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  In the 2021 impact assessment accompanying the CBAM legislative proposal 10 , the Commission concluded that, since CBAM is initially applied to imports of selected basic materials and their products, large businesses would be the primary ones affected, but that in practice the CBAM would result in relatively higher compliance costs for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) compared to large enterprises in scope of CBAM, e.g. those importing CBAM goods above the derogation .  Based on the experience in implementing CBAM in its transitional phase, and on the assessment of stakeholders’ feedback since 1 October 2023, it has become clear that CBAM requires two types of main simplifications: a broader derogation from CBAM requirements of importers of very small quantities of CBAM goods, and a set of simplifications for the rest of the importers of CBAM goods to facilitate their compliance with the administrative requirements.  The proposed simplification is expected to exempt around 90% of importers from CBAM obligations, while maintaining more than 99% of embedded emissions in scope of CBAM, thereby safeguarding the environmental nature of the mechanism.  • Fundamental rights  The proposal respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the Union. In particular, it contributes to the objective of a high level of environmental protection in accordance with the principle of sustainable development as laid down in Article 37 of the Charter.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  This proposal will have implications for the EU budget. Its impact is assessed in the legislative financial and digital statement accompanying this proposal.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  As the proposal amends the CBAM Regulation, it does not have additional implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements beyond the existing ones under the said Regulation.  It is however important to recall that the Commission will continue ensuring that arrangements are in place to monitor and evaluate the functioning of the CBAM, including its enforcement against circumvention practices, and evaluate it against the main policy objectives. Given that the CBAM is one of the policy proposals under the ‘Fit for 55 Package’ adopted by the Commission in July 2021 11 , monitoring and evaluation will be carried out in alignment with the other policies of the package.  The Commission will monitor how CBAM is implemented to feed into its analysis and will regularly report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the application of the CBAM Regulation. As part of that reporting, the Commission will propose possible changes to improve its functioning, collect the necessary information for a potential further extension of the scope of CBAM, including on other goods that could be at risk of carbon leakage, such as downstream products. Those reports should also contain an assessment of the impact of the CBAM on carbon leakage, including in relation to exports, and its economic, environmental, social and territorial impact throughout the Union.  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  The proposal contains two types of simplifications.  First, importers of small quantities of CBAM goods, which represent very small quantities of embedded emissions imported into the Union and in most cases correspond to SMEs and individuals, will be exempt from CBAM obligations. For those importers, the administrative burden resulting from compliance with CBAM obligations significantly outweighs the environmental and regulatory benefit. This is due to the combination of (i) the insignificant share of embedded emissions in all their CBAM goods imported into the Union and (ii) the inability of national authorities to enforce the rules due to the large numbers of importers of small quantities of CBAM goods.  Second, the proposal contains a set of simplifications for importers of CBAM goods above the threshold to facilitate their compliance with the reporting requirements. In particular, the proposal simplifies and streamlines the authorisation procedure for national competent authorities and the Commission, the data collection processes from third country producers to authorised CBAM declarants, the calculation of embedded emissions for certain goods, the emission verification rules, the calculation of the authorised CBAM declarants’ financial liability during the year of imports into the EU and the claim by authorised CBAM declarants for carbon prices paid in third countries where goods are produced.  Article 1(1) amends the derogation from the CBAM obligations by introducing a new mass threshold as laid out in a new Annex VII to the CBAM Regulation, to exclude importers of very small quantities of goods.  Article 1(2) amends the definitions of importer and operator to facilitate reporting requirements.  Articles 1(3) and 1(4), point (b), draw the consequences of the new threshold on the rules related to the authorisation that importers must be granted to import goods above that threshold, and provide for the possibility for authorised CBAM declarants, which remain legally responsible of their CBAM obligations, to technically delegate in the CBAM Registry the reporting requirements to third parties to facilitate compliance.  Articles 1(4)(a) changes the annual deadline for submitting the annual CBAM declaration.  Article 1(4)(c) introduces the possibility for authorised CBAM declarants to claim a carbon price paid in a third country other than the country of origin.  Articles 1(4), point (d), and 1(6) amend the rules on emission verification so that the obligation to verify embedded emissions only applies to actual values.  Article 1(5) amends the calculation of embedded emissions in the case of relevant input materials (precursors).  Article 1(7) introduces the possibility for authorised CBAM declarants to use default carbon prices calculated and made available by the Commission and claim carbon prices paid in third countries other than the country of origin of the goods.  Article 1(8) facilitates reporting obligations by introducing several changes to the portal established pursuant to Article 10 to register operators and installations in third countries.  Article 1(9) creates the registration of accredited verifiers so they can access the CBAM registry and carry out certain relevant tasks to facilitate reporting obligations.  Article 1(10) strengthens the empowerment Member States give to their national competent authority to carry out the CBAM-related duties and responsibilities.  Articles 1(11) and 1(13) draw the consequences of the changes introduced by this proposal on the requirements applying on the CBAM registry, risk analysis and monitoring.  Article 1(12) streamlines the consultation of other competent authorities and the Commission to reduce excessive administrative burden.  Article 1(14) sets the start date of the sales of CBAM certificates to February 2027 to address significant uncertainties related to the year 2026, which is the first year of the post-transitional period, and streamlines the information exchanges between the CBAM registry and the common central platform.  Articles 1(15) and 1(18) draw the consequences of the move of certificate sales to 2027 on the determination of the financial adjustment for the year 2026.  Article 1(16) simplifies the calculation as from 2027 by authorised CBAM declarants of their expected financial liability during the year of imports.  Article 1(17) modifies the repurchase limit to facilitate the way authorised CBAM declarant may manage their CBAM financial liability and draws the consequence of the change of the CBAM declaration submission annual deadline.  Articles 1(19) modifies the scope of information exchanged with customs authorities, the competent authorities and the Commission to reflect the introduction of the derogation.  Articles 1(20) and 1(22) introduce the rules and information exchanges on the monitoring of the derogation.  Article 1(21) introduces the possibility for competent authorities to modulate the penalty based on relevant facts and circumstances and draws the consequences of the new derogation.  Article 1(23) amends the empowerments given to the Commission by the co-legislators to adopt delegated acts in light of the simplifications made by this proposal.  Article 1(24) complements the reporting by the Commission to the co-legislators with the application of the derogation as amended by this proposal.  Article 1(25) amends the list of CBAM goods to exclude non-calcined kaolinic clays.  Article 1(26) adds electricity to the list of CBAM goods for which only direct emissions are to be taken into account in the calculation of the embedded emissions.  Article 1(27) amends Annex IV to Regulation (EU) 2023/956 to exclude input materials which have been subject to the EU ETS or to a carbon pricing system that is fully linked with the EU ETS.  Article 1(28) introduces a new Annex VII to set the threshold referred to in Article 1(1) point (b).  Finally, the Annexes contain several simplifications of embedded emission calculation to facilitate reporting obligations, for instance in the case of default values or precursors produced in the EU.  2025/0039 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulation (EU) 2023/956 as regards simplifying and strengthening the carbon border adjustment mechanism  (Text with EEA relevance)  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192(1) thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 12 ,  Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions 13 ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) During the transitional period , which started on 1 October 2023, the Commission has been collecting data and information on the implementation of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (‘CBAM’) as provided for in Regulation (EU) 2023/956 of the European Parliament and of the Council 14 , including through the analysis of quarterly reports submitted by reporting declarants. The information collected and the exchanges with the stakeholders, including as part of the expert group on the CBAM, have outlined possibilities for simplification s and improvement of the CBAM. The Union is committed to ensure a smooth roll-out of the CBAM during the post-transitional period starting on 1 January 2026 .  (2) Based on the experience acquired and data collected during the transitional period, t he distribution of importers of CBAM goods into the Union shows that only a small proportion of importers accounts for the vast majority of embedded emissions in those goods . The derogation applied to the importation of goods of negligible value referred to in Article 23 of Regulation (EC) No 1186/2009 (consignments of a value below EUR 150) appears insufficient to ensure that the CBAM applies to importers in proportion to their impact on emissions covered by Regulation (EU) 2023/956. For th o se importers of small quantities of goods, compliance with CBAM reporting and financial obligations could be unduly burdensome . Furthermore, as part of the 2023 Customs reform package, the Commission proposed to remove this derogation 15 . Therefore, a n ew derogation should be introduced to exempt importers of small quantities in terms of mass of CBAM goods from CBAM obligations, while preserving the environmental objective of th a t mechanism and its capacity to achieve its climate objective .  (3) A new threshold based on cumulative mass per importer per year should be introduced in Regulation (EU) 2023/956, ensuring that more than 99% of emissions are maintained in scope. This is a robust and targeted approach as it accurately reflects the environmental nature of the CBAM by taking into account all imported emissions over a period of time in determining the threshold. It also eliminates the risk of circumvention through the artificial splitting of consignments by a single importer.  (4) A mass-based threshold reflecting the average emissions intensity of the volume of imported CBAM goods would better translate the climate objective of the CBAM. A single mass-based threshold applying cumulatively to all CBAM goods in the iron and steel, aluminium, fertilisers and cement sectors imported by importers during a calendar year is the simplest design for importers, as they will not have to obtain or provide any data additional to those provided in the customs declaration, thereby reducing substantially any CBAM-related administrative burden for these importers. A threshold set at a level of 50 tonnes will exempt the vast majority of importers from obligations under Regulation (EU) 2023/956 while maintaining more than 99% of embedded emissions in the scope of the CBAM . To establish the threshold, a new Annex VII should be introduced.  (5) The main principles governing the threshold, including ensuring that nearly all embedded emissions remain in the scope of the CBAM, should be laid down in Regulation (EU) 2023/956 to provide legal certainty. Regulation (EU) 2023/956 should also provide for the possibility to re-c alculate the threshold on the basis of updated average emission intensities of imported goods or significant changes in trade patterns or practices of circumvention affecting the coverage of embedded emissions in the scope of the CBAM .  (6) To ensure that the derogation is sufficiently targeted, it should apply to the importer. The indirect customs representative, due to the nature of its activity and the related obligations under Regulation (EU) 2023/956, should always be required to obtain an authorisation .  (7) The competent authorities and the Commission should – based on customs information – monitor the quantities of goods imported to assess compliance with the threshold. To allow the competent authorities to make an informed decision, the customs authorities and the Commission should make the necessary information and data available to the competent authorities. Where the competent authority concludes that an importer has exceeded the threshold, it should communicate that information to the customs authorities who , in turn, should not allow further importation of goods from that importer until the end of the calendar year , or until th at importer has obtained the status of authorised CBAM declarant .  (8) Where an importer expects to exceed the annual threshold or intends to import goods after exceeding the threshold, the importer should apply for authorisation pursuant to Article 5 of Regulation (EU) 2023/956. For importers who have not been granted the authorisation before exceeding the threshold, penalties should apply for the entirety of the imported goods in accordance with Article 26(2) of Regulation (EU) 2023/956. The payment of the penalty in accordance with Article 26(2) of that Regulation should release the importer from the obligation to submit a CBAM declaration and to surrender CBAM certificates .  (9) T o ensure that the definition of an importer covers all relevant customs procedures, it is necessary to amend it to include the case of the simplified customs procedure where only a bill of discharge is submitted pursuant to Article 175(5) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/2446 16 .  (10) T o strike a balance between the effectiveness of the authorisation procedure and the risk profile of the applicants, the consultation procedure should be optional for the competent authority. The consultation procedure should allow the competent authority to consult other competent authorities and the Commission when considered necessary based on the information submitted by the applicant and customs information made available in the CBAM registry .  (11) To provide additional flexibility, the authorised CBAM declarant s should be able to delegate the submission of the CBAM declaration to a third party. The authorised CBAM declarant should remain liable for the submission of the CBAM declaration . To provide the required delegation and access, th at third party should fulfil certain technical credentials, including holding an Economic Operators Registration and Identification (EORI) number and being established in a Member State .  (12) Authorised CBAM declarants are required to submit their annual CBAM declaration and surrender the corresponding number of certificates by 31 May of the year following the year of import. In order to provide authorised CBAM declarants flexibility to comply with their oblig ations , a later date of submission would provide authorised CBAM declarants more time to collect the necessary information, ensure that embedded emissions are verified by an accredited verifier, and purchase the corresponding number of CBAM certificates . The date for the cancellation of CBAM certificates should be adjusted accordingly.  (13) The embedded emissions of some aluminium and steel goods currently included in the scope of CBAM are primarily determined by the embedded emissions of input materials (precursors), while the emissions arising during the production steps of th o se goods are typically relatively low. They consist of finishing processes that are carried out by separate installations not covered by the EU e missions t rading s ystem ( ‘EU ETS ’ ) as provided for in Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 17 , except for the case of integrated facilities. The embedded emissions of those production processes should be excluded from the system boundaries of the calculation of emissions .  (14) Where input materials (precursors) have already been subject to the EU ETS or to a carbon pricing system that is fully linked with the EU ETS , the embedded emissions of th o se precursors should not be accounted for in the calculation of the embedded emissions of complex goods .  (15) Authorised CBAM declarants are required to submit an annual CBAM declaration containing the calculation of embedded emissions on the basis of either default values or actual values verified by accredited verifiers . Default values will be calculated and made available by the Commission. Therefore, the verification of embedded emissions should only apply to actual values .  (16) Information collected during the transitional period illustrates difficulties for reporting declarants to obtain the required information on the carbon price effectively paid in a third country. To facilitate the deduction of the carbon price, the Commission should, where possible, establish an annual average carbon price expressed in EUR/tCO 2 e of the effective carbon price paid, based on the best available data from reliable, publicly available information and information provided by third countries , including on a conservative basis .  (17) Authorised CBAM declarants may claim a reduction in the number of CBAM certificates to be surrendered corresponding to the carbon price effectively paid in the country of origin for the declared embedded emissions. Since the carbon price may be paid in a third country other than the country of origin of the imported goods, such carbon price should also be eligible for deduction .  (18) To improve the reliability of the emissions data contained in the CBAM registry and to facilitate the submission of data, accredited verifiers should be allowed to access the CBAM registry to verify the embedded emissions upon request from an operator in third countrie s . In addition, parent companies or related undertakings of th ose operator s should be allowed to access the CBAM registry for the purpose of registering and sharing relevant data on be half of the controlled operator . The o perators should be required to provide a corporate or activity registration number to ensure their identification .  (19) To foster the implementation of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 at national level, Member States should ensure that the competent authorities have the necessary powers to perform their duties .  (20) To provide authorised CBAM declarants sufficient time to prepare for compliance with the amended obligations under Regulation (EU) 2023/956, Member States should start selling CBAM certificates in 2027 for emissions embedded in goods imported during the year 2026. The price of CBAM certificates , purchased in 2027 and corresponding to emissions embedded in goods imported into the EU in 2026 , should reflect the prices of EU ETS allowances in 2026 .  (21) The obligation for the authorised CBAM declarant s to ensure that the number of CBAM certificates on their account in the CBAM registry at the end of each quarter corresponds to at least 80 % of the emissions embedded in the goods they have imported since the start of the year , is insufficiently tailored to the expected financial adjustment. It is therefore necessary to both reduce the ratio from 80 % to 50 % and integrate the free allocation of EU ETS allowances. Furthermore, the authorised CBAM declarant should be able to rely on the information submitted in the CBAM declaration in the previous year, for the same goods and third countr ies .  (22) The repurchase limit should likewise align more accurately with the number of CBAM certificates which the authorised CBAM declarants are required to purchase during the year of imports .  (23) Since CBAM certificate s are cancelled without any compensation , there is no need for an exchange of information from the common central platform to the CBAM registry at the end of the working day.  (24) The competent authorities, when applying penalties, should be able to take into account the specific circumstances such as the intentional or negligent behaviour of the declarant. Th at would allow for a reduction of the amount of the penalty where minor or unintentional errors are made .  (25) The CBAM applies to certain carbon-intensive goods imported into the U nion . The list of CBAM goods in Annex I of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 includes ‘ [o] ther kaolinic clays’ in the list of cement goods. While calcined kaolinic clays are carbon-intensive products, this is not the case for non-calcined kaolinic clays. Non-calcined kaolinic clays should therefore be excluded from the scope of the CBAM .  (26) Annex II to Regulation (EU) 2023/956 lists the goods for which only direct emissions should be taken into account in the calculation of embedded emissions. For goods not listed in that Annex, both direct and indirect emissions should be taken into account. Since indirect emissions are not relevant in the case of electricity generation, electricity should be added to the list of goods in that Annex .  (27) It is also necessary to simplify the means for determining default values when reliable data for the exporting country would not be available for a certain type of goods. In such cases, to prevent carbon leakage, the default value should be set at the level of the average emission intensity of the ten exporting countries with the highest emission intensities for which reliable data is available , which is an appropriate average to ensure the environmental objective of the CBAM . This is without prejudice to the possibility to adapt these default values based on region-specific features pursuant to point 7 of Annex IV of the CBAM.  (28) In order to amend certain non-essential elements of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 , the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of amending the threshold in Annex VII to that Regulation, where necessary, as determined in accordance with Article 2(3a) of that Regulation . It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making*. In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States' experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.  * Interinstitutional Agreement between the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission on Better Law-Making, Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making, (OJ L 123, 12.5.2016, p. 1–14, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/agree_interinstit/2016/512/oj ) .  (29) Since the objectives of this Regulation cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States , namely simplifying certain obligations and strengthening the mechanism that the Union has adopted to prevent the risk of carbon leakage and thereby reduce global carbon emissions but can rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.  (30) Regulation (EU) 2023/956 should therefore be amended accordingly ,  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Article 1  Amendments to Regulation (EU) 2023/956  Regulation (EU) 2023/956 is amended as follows:  (1) Article 2 is amended as follows:  (a) paragraph 3 is replaced by the following:  ‘3.

FRAMEWORK OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE  1.1. Title of the proposal/initiative  Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism  1.2. Policy area(s) concerned  Climate policy  1.3. Objective(s)  1.3.1. General objective(s)  In light of the EU’s increased climate ambitions, the introduction of a CBAM has the overarching objective of addressing climate change by reducing GHG emissions in the EU and globally.  The amending proposal aims at simplifying the compliance burden on importers of CBAM goods.  1.3.2. Specific objective(s)  The overarching objective of addressing climate change is further articulated in a number of specific objectives, namely: (i) Addressing the risk of carbon leakage under increased EU ambition. (ii) Contributing to the provision of a stable and secure policy framework for investments in low or zero carbon technologies. (iii) Ensuring that domestic production and imports are subject to similar level of carbon pricing. (iv) Encouraging producers in third countries who export to the EU to adopt low carbon technologies. (v) Ensuring that the measure is effective, minimising the risk of being circumvented, thus providing environmental integrity. (vi) Ensuring a proportionate administrative burden for businesses and public authorities in the application of the measure.  The amending proposal aims at: (i) reducing administrative burden; (ii) improving the functioning of CBAM.  1.3.3. Expected result(s) and impact  Specify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.  The introduction of a CBAM envisages a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions both in the EU-27 and in the rest of the world in the sectors covered by CBAM. The CBAM is also expected to reduce the risks of carbon leakage, therefore gradually replacing the free allocation of allowances under the EU ETS.  As regards economic impacts, the modelling conducted before the adoption of the CBAM Regulation indicated that the introduction of a CBAM and other measures needed to reach the EU’s increased climate ambitions could lead to a GDP contraction for the EU 27 by 0.22 % to 0.23 % in 2030. Impact on the investment side is modest. On the consumption side CBAM appears to have a slightly stronger negative effect relative to the scenario of increased climate ambition and no CBAM.  By effectively reducing carbon leakage, the introduction of a CBAM leads to a reduction in imports in the EU 27. Overall, the social impacts of CBAM are limited.  Administrative impacts on the Commission, businesses national authorities, are expected. Altogether, compliance costs for businesses and authorities, while significant, are expected to be proportionate, and manageable in light of the environmental benefits of the measure. While revenue generation is not an objective of CBAM is expected to generate additional revenue, which for 2030 is estimated at above EUR [2.1 billion to be updated].  The amending proposal expects to:  (i) reduce the number of entities subject to CBAM obligations while preserving the environmental integrity of the mechanism and its capacity to achieve its climate objective;  (ii) enhance the functioning of the mechanism by simplifying and streamlining processes and procedures. The proposal will make it easier for importers of goods into the Union to comply with CBAM reporting obligations by simplifying some of those CBAM reporting requirements which relate to complex calculations or rely on hazardous data collection processes which hamper effective CBAM implementation.  In addition, the proposal will also strengthen the monitoring and supervision of CBAM. It will increase the ability of the Commission to process data and exchange relevant information with national authorities to ensure that the utility of the information reported by stakeholders is maximised. It will also enable both the Commission to better detect risks and national authorities to be better equipped to take appropriate actions where needed.  1.3.4. Indicators of performance  Specify the indicators for monitoring progress and achievements.  Exempt from CBAM obligations importers of small quantities of CBAM goods  Optimisation of processes to increase effectiveness and reduce administrative burden  1.4. The proposal/initiative relates to:   a new action   a new action following a pilot project / preparatory action 18   the extension of an existing action   a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action  1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative  1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative  The CBAM was introduced from October 2023. A simplified system of the CBAM scheme is currently in place until the end of 2025. Specifically, a transitional period (dry-run for data collection) currently applies to facilitate the smooth roll out of the CBAM and allow traders and importers to adjust.  Commission services are in charge of implementing and enforcing CBAM both during the transition period (2023-2025) and will also be during the definitive phase (from 2026).  During the transition period this implies collecting information from importers of CBAM goods in the EU on the embedded GHG emissions of these goods and analysing data.  The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) calls for a progressive introduction of the different functions necessary for its effective implementation. Firstly, a number of reports and reviews need to be prepared in order to facilitate the financial obligation to be set in place. Recognizing this, the CBAM regulation foresees its implementation in two consecutive periods: the Transitional Period from October 2023 until end of 2025 and the Definitive Period as from early 2026.  During the Transitional Period the obligation placed on importers and the EU Authorities (customs) is limited to the filing of the quarterly CBAM reports in addition of the Import declarations.  During the transitional period, transitional information management system (CBAM Transitional Period – CBAM TP) were put in place to support the submission and collection of quarterly reports, as well as the assimilation of data from each report into an aggregated database, to allow for their effective analysis for the purposes of reporting in line with the provisions of the Regulation.  Additionally, during the transitional period, customs authorities are tasked with informing customs declarants of the obligation to report information, so as to contribute to the gathering of information as well as to the awareness on the need to request the status of authorised declarant when applicable (before the first importation of CBAM goods from 1 January 2026).  The Definitive Period is planned to start on the 01.01.26 for the core CBAM declaration and certificates management services as listed here and one year earlier for authorised declarants registration and processing of CBAM authorisations by the competent authorities:  - importers are only entitled to import these goods after they have been granted an authorisation (except in case of the derogation proposed in the amending Regulation) by competent authorities, or if they would appoint a representative authorised as CBAM declarant. Customs authorities should not allow the importation of CBAM goods without a authorised CBAM declarant being involved. Furthermore, the customs authorities may carry out checks on the goods, including with respect to the identification of the authorised CBAM declarant, the eight-digit CN code, the quantity and the country of origin of the imported goods, the date of declaration and the customs procedure. The Commission should include the risks relating to CBAM in the design of the common risk criteria and standards pursuant to Article 50 of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013  - The CBAM should be based on a declarative system where an authorised CBAM declarant, who may act on its own behalf or represent one or more importers, submits annually a declaration of the embedded emissions in the goods imported to the customs territory of the Union and surrenders a number of CBAM certificates corresponding to those declared emissions.  - An authorised CBAM declarant should be allowed to claim a reduction in the number of CBAM certificates to be surrendered corresponding to the carbon price already effectively paid for those emissions in other jurisdictions. The amending Regulation proposes to introduce a default carbon price which would allow declarants to claim a deduction where it cannot be demonstrated that a carbon price has been effectively paid.  - The embedded declared emissions should be verified by a person accredited by an EU national accreditation body where actual emissions are declared.  - The CBAM central system should allow operators of production installations in third countries to register in the CBAM registry and to make their verified embedded GHG emissions from production of goods available to authorised CBAM declarants. The Commission should manage the CBAM registry containing data on the authorised CBAM declarants, operators and installations in third countries. The amending Regulation proposes to allow accredited verifiers to access the registry to improve the reliability of emission data shared by operators with declarants through the registry.  - To reduce the risk of carbon leakage the Commission should take action to address practices of circumvention  - For the sale and re-purchase of CBAM certificates a common central platform should be established. For the purpose of oversight of the transactions on the common central platform, the Commission should facilitate the exchanges of information and the cooperation between competent authorities, and between those authorities and the Commission. Additionaly, a swift flow of information between the common central platform and the CBAM registry should be establised.  - The Commission should carry out risk-based controls and should review the content of the CBAM declarations accordingly. For enforcement purposes, Member States may also carry out reviews of individual CBAM declarations. The conclusions of the reviews of individual CBAM declarations should be shared with the Commission and should be made available to other competent authorities in the CBAM registry.  - Member States should be responsible for the correct establishment and collection of revenues arising from the application of this Regulation.  Therefore, during the definitive period the number of tasks attributed to the EC increase drastically, requiring an increase in staffing needs. The tasks carried out by this team will include the supervision of authorisation of CBAM declarants made by MS competent authorities, the management of the central database and central registry, coordination and information exchange with MS competent authorities, review of declarations and oversight of the external platform and lastly, tasks requiring legal competencies such as litigation and recovery and financial responsibility oversight. The structure of the team is further defined below.  During the definitive period the Commission will be in charge of the majority of the tasks resulting from the CBAM regulation.  CBAM IT Budget  The CBAM Budget to be engaged/ committed for the period 2023-2027 have been assessed at 101,74 M€.The CBAM IT budget encompasses Analysis & Development services, Deployment services, Operations services, cloud services and/or on premises hardware and software licenses for the Transitional and Definitive CBAM System as detailed below :  - The CAPEX cost has been estimated based on the actual budget engaged and the budget authorised by EC IT Corporate Governance in the form of approved Vision Documents for the following past projects of DG TAXUD IT projects, due to their similarities in terms of IT Architecture Model: CDS, CRMS2, SURV3, REX, CSRD2, EBTI, Customs Trans-European Declaration Management Systems developed and operated by DG TAXUD.  - The OPEX cost has been assessed on the basis of the current annual infrastructure and operational costs of DG TAXUD, their provisions for IT infrastructure, IT Support and Service Desk activities for the production systems delivered by the projects referenced above.  - The pricing is based on the current Framework Contracts pricing in place.  In the IT Policy budget line, the budget of the joint procurement between the COM and MS of the platform for buying and selling of certificates for managing operations is not included.  The CBAM team would consist of 90 EC staff (including 15 IT staff) in 2027.  The amending Regulation proposes to introduce rationalisations of administrative requirements, including reporting. Since those requirements were introduced by Union Law, their rationalization is also  best done at EU level to ensure legal certainty and consistency of reporting. This change corresponds to additional IT cost of 18,95 M€ for the period of 2025-2027.  This will ensure a level playing field for companies and authorities across the Union, which will be benefiting from the rationalisation of reporting requirements arising from this proposal.

The CBAM IT team consists of 15 members of specialised IT profiles for defining and managing CBAM IT System Architecture and Project Organisation and planning, the activities in terms of development, deployment, the organisation of the Service Model, the management of operations and support in front of Trade, COM services, climatic and Customs authorities, in parallel of the Transitional and definitive CBAM IT systems.  The CBAM IT team would consist of 15 EC staff structured as presented in the graph below:  The proposed plan of deploying the CBAM IT team is the following:  Table: Row 1 — Year; 2023; 2024; 2025; 2026; 2027 Row 2 — No of Resources; 8; 12; 15; 15; 15 Row 3 — AD; 4; 5; 5; 5; 5 Row 4 — CA; 4; 7; 10; 10; 10  1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, great er effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this section 'added value of EU involvement' is the value resulting from EU action, that is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.  Reasons for action at EU level (ex-ante) Reducing GHG emissions is fundamentally a trans-boundary issue that requires effective action at the largest possible scale. The EU as a supranational organisation is well-placed to establish effective climate policy in the EU, like it has done with the EU ETS.  There exists already a harmonised carbon price at EU level. This consists of the price resulting from the EU ETS for the sectors covered by the system. The only meaningful way to ensure equivalence between the carbon pricing policy applied in the EU’s internal market and the carbon pricing policy applied on imports is to take action at the level of the Union.  Any initiative needs to be implemented in a way that provides importers, regardless of country of origin and port of entry or destination within the EU, with uniform conditions and incentives for GHG emission reductions that are equivalent to those of domestic producers. The single effective way to do this is by taking action at the level of the EU.  The proposed simplification introduced by the amending Regulation is best done at EU level to ensure legal certainty and consistency. This will ensure a level playing field for companies and authorities across the Union, which will be benefiting from the rationalisation of reporting requirements arising from this proposal.  Expected generated  EU added value (ex-post) In parallel to the EU ETS, reduction of GHG emissions and protection against the risk of carbon leakage in the EU single market can be established most adequately at the EU level. Additionally, the need for minimal administrative costs is best achieved by establishing consistent rules for the entire single market, further underlining the added value of an intervention at the EU level.  The public consultation has confirmed the added value of taking action on the CBAM at the EU level. In particular, stakeholders agree that an EU CBAM is needed due to existing differences of ambition between the EU and the rest of the world and in order to support the global climate efforts. In addition, in view of the EU’s position in international trade, if it introduces a CBAM the environmental effect on international climate ambitions will be most effective as a potential example to follow.  Thus, the objective of reducing emissions and climate neutrality requires – without equally ambitious global policies – action by the European Union.  1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past  The CBAM is a new mechanism. The preferred option in the Impact Assessment draws from the EU Emissions Trading System and aims at replicating some of its features.  If sufficient ressources are not made available to enforce CBAM correctly, there is a serious risk that businesses will avoid CBAM.  The amending proposal relies on the experience gained in implementing CBAM since the mechanism started to apply in its transitional phase on 1 October 2023.  1.5.4. Compatibility with the multiannual financial framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments  In the interinstitutonal agreement of 16 December 2020, signed in the context of the negotiations, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed that ""the institutions will work towards introducing sufficient new own resources with a view to covering an amount corresponding to the expected expenditure related to the repayment"" of NextGenerationEU. As part of the mandate received, the Commission was invited to put forward a proposal for a CBAM in the first semester of 2021.  The final agreement by co-legislators foresees that most of the implementation and enforcement of CBAM will be the responsibility of the Commission. Therefore, in order to ensure the correct deployment of the proposal the appropriate financing means need to be made available within the current MFF.  The amending proposal is consistent with the objective of the better regulation agenda, as it will strengthen the Commission’s ability to carry out its general supervision of CBAM, while reducing administrative the costs (notably for small importers, but also for Member States’ authorities) that would otherwise be incurred in collecting the information through other means.  1.5.5.

Comments  N/A  2. MANAGEMENT MEASURES  2.1. Monitoring and reporting rules  The Commission will ensure that arrangements are in place to monitor and evaluate the functioning of the CBAM and evaluate it against the main policy objectives.  Before the end of the transitional period at the end of 2025 and every two years thereafter, the Commission will publish comprehensive assessments of the functioning of the CBAM, including its governance. The 2025 report will also review the scope of the CBAM to examine the possibility of extending it to cover emissions of other EU ETS sectors at risk of carbon leakage, products further down the value chain as well indirect emissions for all sectors. For this, it is necessary to monitor the effect of CBAM on the shortlisted sectors.  2.2. Management and control system(s)  2.2.1. Justification of the budget implementation method(s), the funding implementation mechanism(s), the payment modalities and the control strategy proposed  A significantly centralised set-up allows a very uniform and efficient implementation of CBAM across the EU including in Member states with more limited administrative capacity on climate issues. The majority of the implementation and enforcement functions have been attributed to Commission services. These also require an increased number of control functions in order to ensure the correct implementation and management of the CBAM. The Commission has also foreseen an increased number of measures for fraud prevention.  While this simplification package will significantly reduce the administrative burden for importers, notably SMEs, as well as national authorities, this is made possible by Commission services taking up increased responsibilities and more tasks, notably in the monitoring and enforcement.  2.2.2. Information concerning the risks identified and the internal control system(s) set up to mitigate them  The CBAM will be based on a declarative system, which entails the risk of non-declaration or misdeclaration.  In order to address the risk of non-declaration, the system requires an authorisation before importing goods in the scope of the Regulation. National Customs Authorities will be in charge of enforcing this rule by not releasing into free circulation these goods as long as the declarant is not authorised according to this Regulation.  In order to address the risk of misdeclaration a system of auditing on risk assessment criteria as well as random audits will be in place coupled with sanctions set up as a sufficiently high level to serve as deterrent. Auditing will take place both at the level of CBAM declaration by the national authorities and at the level of import declarations by customs authorities.  2.2.3. Estimation and justification of the cost-effectiveness of the controls (ratio between the control costs  and the value of the related funds managed), and assessment of the expected levels of risk of error (at payment & at closure)  Commission services will control the correct application of CBAM, in particular the surrender of CBAM certificates and the correct application of the de minimis threshold. A strong risk management system will be applied to ensure cost-effective controls and tackle risks of circumvention.  2.3. Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities  The financial interests of the Union should be protected through proportionate measures throughout the expenditure cycle, including the prevention, detection and investigation of irregularities, the recovery of funds lost, wrongly paid or incorrectly used and, where appropriate, administrative and financial penalties.  Efficient anti-fraud actions require active cooperation, including knowledge-sharing and exchange of information, between customs authorities and competent authorities, both at national level and EU level; it may also require cooperation with third countries. A specific attention should be drawn to non-reliable economic operators (e.g. shell company, missing traders) and cross-border trade inside the EU.  Quick anti-fraud action should be put in place to react to new/newly detected fraud risks. Authorities in charge should report and share knowledge on fraudulent patterns.  Where an authorised CBAM declarant or an importer fails to comply with the obligations in the CBAM regulation, penalties will be applied. The amount of the penalty will be based on penalties in the EU ETS.  In case of repeated offences, the national competent authority may decide to suspend the account of the declarant.  Commission services, together with national competent authorities and national customs, have set up CBAM risk management network, which will work on a joint anti-circumvention strategy.  3.

Compatibility with the current multiannual financial framework  The proposal/initiative:  –  can be fully financed through redeployment within the relevant heading of the multiannual financial framework (MFF)  –  requires use of the unallocated margin under the relevant heading of the MFF and/or use of the special instruments as defined in the MFF Regulation  –  requires a revision of the MFF  Additional IT expenditures are needed to cover IT development needed to implement changes related to implementation of the CBAM simplification procedures and implement the IT tools supporting detection of the irregularities and limiting the risk of fraud: 6.350M in 2025, 6.850M in 2026 and 5.750M in 2027 – in commitment appropriations. In addition, 2M are needed on an annual basis to cover studies, including to assess regularly the effectiveness of the CBAM as well as outreach activities, including external communication and training sessions with stakeholders. These costs were not covered in the previous LFS. The proposal requires transfering up to 25M from Heading 4 (11.0301 – CCEI) to Heading 3 (09.200401 – CBAM).  3.2.7.

For assigned revenue, specify the budget expenditure line(s) affected.  CBAM – 09 20 04 01  Other remarks (e.g. method/formula used for calculating the impact on revenue or any other information).  Estimates on share of revenue affected was based on internal Commission calculations using Customs import data and default values. These were applied on revenue estimates from the Commission’s 2021 impact assessment, which stood at approximately EUR 2.1 billion in 2030.  Since less than 1% of emissions would not be captured under the new de minimis threshold, the foregone implied revenue for the year 2030 due to emissions not captured is estimated at approximately EUR 21,000,000.  4. Digital dimension s  There are not changes in that Digital concepts and architecture approved by CBAM Definitive system project charter, in terms of digital requirements, data used, digital solution, reusability assessment and Measures to support digital implementation.  The only change is related to the Risk management, Circumvention monitoring which was analyse and assessed and included in Project charter as place holder but not included in the Project Charter estimates. The key objective of the Risk management component is supporting detection of the irregularities and limiting the risk of fraud  Also, the simplification changes do not result in a change of the digital solution architecture, however, requires additional budget to implement the change to features and services already build by CBAM.  4.1. Requirements of digital relevance  Table: Row 1 — As shown in diagram abvoe , the CBAM Registry gets import information for the CBAM goods from the EU Customs systems either from the MS or via DG TAXUD, along with the importers customs identification and the Customs classification of the imported goods. The CBAM system makes in return the CBAM authorisations of the CBAM Declarants available to the National Customs Import Systems to enforce the CBAM regulation at the import clearance of the CBAM goods. The CBAM Information system exchanges as well risk management information with the EU Customs systems. The interface with the EU Customs Systems is a vital feed for the operation of CBAM as the whole concept of CBAM is to avoid double capture of information by requesting the CBAM Declarants to complement their imports with a report of the emission incurred during their production in third Countries. The “data provided once” is a basic principle of CBAM. CBAM will also interact with the new CBAM Mechanism (IT systems or other means) of the National Competent Authorities to foster the integration of the national CBAM enforcement processes across the MS and the national processes for the collection of penalties and recovery information. Another key new external system for CBAM is the Common Central Platform (CCP), the Information System by which the CBAM Declarants will purchase the CBAM certificates from the Member States. The price of the certificates will be set by the allowance price defined in the ETS system. The CBAM Declarants will need to keep their CBAM accounts in an 80% balance on a quarterly basis to ensure that they are in position to surrender the required number of certificates for offsetting their declared emissions and emission prices already paid in third Countries. The Commission will re‑purchase the surplus certificates from the CBAM Declarants in name of the Member States. The Commission and the Member States must jointly establish and manage this platform, which is however outside the scope of the CBAM Registry. The interface with the CCP is vital for the CBAM Declarants to provision the necessary certificates in their CBAM accounts. The accounts and the certificates will be highly sensitive information. The ETS system will simply set the selling price of the certificates. The primary users of the CBAM Registry are the CBAM Declarants. DG TAXUD anticipates that they may amount to 200.000 in 2026 (following the adoption of the simplification the number of declarants will be reduced but it will be further extended by the CBAM extension for the downstream goods). They will use the CBAM Registry to declare the emission accrued on the production of their imported goods on a yearly basis (May of each year), to monitor the quarterly balance of their CBAM accounts in term of certificates versus declared imports and to interact with the National Customs Authorities during review of their CBAM declarations. The CBAM Declarants will first be vetted by the National Competent Authorities via the CBAM Registry and then be granted an authorisation to import CBAM goods and be given a CBAM account. The CBAM Declarants will then be able to declare annually their emissions in the CBAM Registry and to surrender the required certificates. The Operators of the Installations producing the CBAM goods in the third countries will register on the CBAM Registry before entering the emission details of their products. The CBAM Declarants will be able to refer to the entries of the Operators to justify their reported emission. It is a significant measure to reduce the compliance burden of the CBAM Declarants and to improve the quality of the CBAM data. While there is no evidence to support an estimate at this stage, DG TAXUD guestimates the number of Operators at 50.000 in 2026. The CBAM National Competent Authorities (NCA) will use the CBAM Registry to grant the access to the CBAM Declarants, to manage the CBAM Authorisations, to monitor the CBAM accounts and declarations and interact with the CBAM Declarants to ensure their compliance with the CBAM regulation. They are the single point of contact to the CBAM Declarants. Other Authorities will be granted access to the CBAM Registry to contribute to the risk management and the enforcement from their respective areas of responsibilities. The CBAM Registry will coordinate and support the inter-agencies collaboration in fostering compliance. The National Customs Administrations will validate the CBAM Authorisation during the control of the import declarations using the replication and validation services of the CBAM Registry via the EU CSW-CERTEX. The Commission will assign and maintain the CBAM accounts of the CBAM Declarants up to date in the CBAM Registry, combining the information from the imports received from National Customs Administrations, the emissions from the yearly declarations, the quantity of certificates, their purchase reported by the CCP, their yearly surrendering confirmed by the CBAM Declarant, and the re-purchase of unused certificates. The Commission will use the CBAM Registry to monitor the imported goods and associated emissions, for the risk management, and particularly the risk of circumvention. The CBAM Registry will also offer a secure forum for the exchange of sensitive information between all Authorities having a responsibility in the enforcement of the CBAM regulation. The access of all actors to the CBAM Registry via dedicated portals supported by a distributed access management across the stakeholders: · The NCA will manage the access of the CBAM Declarants to the CBAM Declarant portal, using either national credentials already granted by the National Customs Administrations or an EU login one; · The Commission will manage the access of the Operators of the third countries Installations, to the same name portal, using credentials granted by EU login. It remains to be clarified whether the Commission will rely on external trusted parties to delegate them the granting of the authorisation to access the CBAM Registry; · The NCA, the Commission and other Authorities will each manage the access to their users. The CBAM Core Registry depicts the automated processes that the Commission will operate to fulfil its obligations under the CBAM regulation, as summarised above. The Reference Data Management will be a key -office process ensuring the consistency and integrity of all automated processes serving the collaboration and cooperation between all stakeholders. Beyond the “simple” list of goods, of National Competent Authorities, and of the price of emission, they will list the specific parameters used to report emissions according to specific methodologies and the default value for the emissions as established. The default value is key for the plausibility validation of the declared emissions.  4.2. Data  Table: Row 1 — CBAM will be processing following data assets · CBAM Declarant Data.

Digital solutions  Table: Row 1 — CBAM Registry High Level architecture will be made of 3 layers: · The portal layer offering different portals for each of the user communities of the CBAM Registry: CBAM Declarants, Operators of the third countries Installations, CBAM National Competent Authorities, the Commission, The National Customs Administrations, OLAF, and other EC services; · The User Access Management layer : to manage the Authentication and Authorisation of the users of the CBAM Registry. The National Competent Authorities will need to provide and manage the access of the CBAM Declarants (expected to be above 200.000 parties in 2026) while the Commission will do the same for the third countries Operators (estimated at 50.000 parties in 2026) each MS and EU administrations being in charge of the access of its own users;, each MS and EU administrations being in charge of the access of its own users; · The Back End : to support all data and rule management required for CBAM as well as all interactions with external systems. To be noted that: to support all data and rule management required for CBAM as well as all interactions with external systems. To be noted that: o CBAM will implement numerous workflows, notifications, and exchanges of information across the Commission, the National Competent Authorities and the CBAM Declarants, in particular in the areas of declaration submission, review (including risk assessment); o The management of the Declarant accounts, the management CBAM certificates (potentially financial assets), the risk management and the secure exchange of information have high security requirements.  4.4. Interoperability assessment  Table: Row 1 — CBAM is cross border by design as it supports the CBAM lifecycle across the EU, and in particular the orchestration of the Risk Assessment, review of the CBAM Declarations across all NCA and the Commission. Collaboration across National Customs systems will be ensured, by leveraging the Commission’s IT services and interfaces (such as SURV3, EU CSW - CERTEX), as well as new components, specifically designed for CBAM purposes. The CBAM Registry has been designed to support interoperability by emphasizing use on openness, modularity, decoupling and robust interfaces. It will interact with the CBAM national systems, with the Common Central Platform, the EU Customs systems from DG TAXUD and the National Customs Administrations, with the other DG’s systems via open interfaces The CBAM Central Repository will use the existing interfaces of the EU Customs Systems managed by DG TAXUD and will define dedicated formats for the Customs Import and Inward Processing records to be provided by the National Customs Administrations. The new interfaces with the National Customs Systems will be published early 2024 to allow the National Customs Administrations enough lead time to prepare their systems accordingly. The S2S interface between the CBAM Registry and the CCP will be based on structured messages exchange and be available early 2024 to allow enough lead time for both the CBAM Registry and the CCP to integrate their respective interfaces by mid-2025. The S2S interface between the CBAM Registry and the CBAM National Systems (to be developed by the MS) will be based on structured message exchanges and also be made available early 2024. The S2S interface with the systems of the other EU Authorities will be specified and developed on a bilateral basis during the elaboration and build of the CBAM Registry. All these interfaces will be structured messages based and will comply as far as possible with the EUCDM and with the UCC Annex B. The A2B and B2B specifications will be referred in a CBAM Implementing Act Reusability Constraints The reusability is at the very heart of the architecture principles adopted for the CBAM Central Register. There are two sides to the reusability: use of external services by the CBAM Registry and re-use components in the build of the CBAM Registry. Reusability from DG TAXUD services and components The CBAM Registry will use the EU Customs Services offered by DG TAXUD out of the box to: · retrieve the EORI information of the trader; · get the customs import records available from Surveillance 3; · get the CBAM goods from the TARIC system; · offer the CBAM Authorisations Replication and Validation service to the National Customs Systems via the EU CSW-CERTEX and; · exchange secure information with the CRMS2 system. The user access management of the portals of the CBAM Registry will be entrusted to UUM&DS, allowing the willing MS to re-use the Customs credentials of the CBAM Declarants to provide them access to the CBAM Declarant portal and the Commission (or trusted third parties) to grant access right to the Operators of the third countries Installations to their EU Login authentication credentials. The CBAM Registry will reuse several technology components of the DG TAXUD and Corporate IT landscape without compromising its compliance with the floatability principle spelt out in the Architecture Overview in appendix 2, namely: · The DG TAXUD TSOAP middleware architecture which will be reused in each of the CBAM Registry compartments; · The monitoring and auditing COTS Elk and Kafka; · The sources of the Customs application framework management (TATAFng) of DG TAXUD; · The documentation and source code of the Customs Decision Management System of DG TAXUD for the built of the CBAM Authorisation system; · The documentation and source code of the Customer Reference System of DG TAXUD to provision the CBAM Authorisations to the National Customs Systems for their control during the import clearance; · The documentation and source code of the Customs Risk Management System 2 (CRMS2) of DG TAXUD to provision the Secure Forum for Exchange of Information; · The DG TAXUD TEMPO methodology, including PM²; · The 2 Data Centres of DG TAXUD for the testing, integration and for as long as the CBAM Registry operation is entrusted to DG TAXUD, along with their firewalling, Active-Active clustering, the load balancing and the 2 DC Active-Passive to ensure the scalability, High Availability, Disaster Recovery, some of the security needed by the CBAM Registry. To be noted that DG TAXUD has followed all recommendations from DIGIT since 2014 when designing Business Application Services, Data Services and Utility Services for its generation of SOA applications. Reusability from EU corporate services and components The CBAM Registry will use EU Login for the authentication of the CBAM declarants of the MS being UUM&DS type D, of the Operators of the third Countries Installations and all officials of the National Competent Authorities, of the Commission, of the National Customs Administration and other Commission services. The CBAM Registry will use the Customs eIDAS eID network for the authentication of the CBAM Declarants from the MS UUM&DS type A, B & C. The CBAM Registry will use UUM&DS for the authorisation of all its users. A migration from UUM&DS to EU Access will be considered when all functionalities of UUM&DS will be offered by EU Access, including the support of the Customs eIDAS eID network. The CBAM Registry will make available the CBAM public information on Europa. In addition, DG TAXUD is keen to maximize the re-use of Corporate services and components that would meet some of the CBAM requirements, de-risk its timely deployment and secure the quality of its operation while lowering its CAPEX and OPEX.  4.5. Measures to support digital i mplementation  Table: Row 1 — The CBAM regulation defines the deployment of the CBAM Registry in two periods declined in 3 consecutive phases: · Period perspective : a progressive deployment during a Transitional Period from the Q4 2023 until the Q4 2025, followed by a Definitive Period from Q1 2026. o During the Transitional Period, the CBAM importers report the emission of their imported goods quarterly but do not have to purchase and surrender certificates. It is the running in period of the CBAM scheme. o During the Definitive Period , starting on 01 January 2026, the CBAM Declarants must be authorised, they declare their emissions once per year, they purchase certificates to keep their CBAM account at minimum 80% balance between their emissions and the purchased certificates, and they surrender their certificates with their yearly declarations. · Phase & Part perspective : o CBAM Phase 1 : the “CBAM reports” by the importers of CBAM goods (so called Part 1), to be used during the whole Transitional Period as from Q4 2023 (out of scope of the Project Charter); o CBAM Phase 2: the “CBAM reports” provided by the importers of CBAM goods (Part 1), the CBAM Declarant Authorisation and the registration of the Operators of third countries Installations (so called Part 2) as from 31 December 2024 in anticipation of the Definitive Period; o CBAM Phase 3: The Part 2 augmented with the CBAM declarations and certificates along with the full CBAM account management (so called Part 3) as from the start of the Definitive Period but without Part 1 “CBAM Reports” as from the end of the Transitional Period 31 December 2025.  Table: Row 1 — Deployment in two phases/parts of the CBAM Registry The CBAM Phase 1 (implementation of CBAM Part 1 and its operation from Q4 2023 until end 2025 is entirely covered by the Project Charter of the Transitional Period The two figures below illustrate the approach to deliver the full scope of the Definitive System in two phases, depicting the user communities, the external systems at play and the main entities being managed in the scope of the respective phases. Refer to the next section for the definition of the external systems and entities. CBAM Part 2 Scope: on top of Part 1, The “CBAM reports” by the importers of CBAM goods, comes the Part 2 “CBAM Authorisation and Installations” (both in green in the following diagrams), which will enter in operation on 31 December 2024 as mandated by the CBAM regulation. Both Part 1 and Part 2 will then be further maintained and evolved during the remaining of the Transitional Period. The “CBAM Authorisation and Installation” will be integrated in the CBAM Definitive System while the “CBAM reports” will be phased out at the end of the Transitional Period. The Part 1 and Part 2 interface the CBAM Registry with the National Customs Import Systems, with the National Customs Inward Processing Systems and the supporting EU Customs systems of DG TAXUD to foster compliance at minimal burden for trade. CBAM Part 2 comes in anticipation of the Definitive System by delivering its first component. The CBAM Phase 2 Timeline : It starts on the 31 December 2024 and ends on the 31 December 2025 with the start of the Definitive Period. The user community is extended to the Operators of the Installations in the third countries while the CBAM Declarants will need to obtain the required authorisations for the Definitive Period.  Table: Row 1 — CBAM Part 3 Scope: The “CBAM Declarations, Accounts and Risk Management” part (in purple in the following diagram), will enter in operations at the start of the Definitive Period scheduled for the 1 January 2026. It constitutes the core of the CBAM definitive system. CBAM Part 3 also includes the interfaces with the National Import Systems for the CBAM Authorisations via the EU CSW-CERTEX, the Common Central Platform for the purchasing of CBAM Certificates, ETS, OLAF, and the Systems of the National Competent Authorities. Furthermore, it adds the CBAM Certificates capabilities to the CBAM Registry as well as all the Risk Management ones. As the CBAM Certificates and Risk Management modules handle confidential information and monitor cases of circumvention and non-compliance, CBAM Part 3 manages sensitive information and requires highly secure processes. This part will be further maintained and evolved during the Definitive Period. The CBAM Phase 3 Timeline : It starts on the 1 January 2026 and matches with the Definitive Period. During this phase, only the parts 2 & 3 of CBAM will operate in parallel and in close interaction, as the Part 1 was specific for the Transitional Period and is phased out. The user community is extended to the National Customs Administrations CBAM Part 3 Scope: The “CBAM Declarations, Accounts and Risk Management” part (in purple in the following diagram), will enter in operations at the start of the Definitive Period scheduled for the 1 January 2026. It constitutes the core of the CBAM definitive system. CBAM Part 3 also includes the interfaces with the National Import Systems for the CBAM Authorisations via the EU CSW-CERTEX, the Common Central Platform for the purchasing of CBAM Certificates, ETS, OLAF, and the Systems of the National Competent Authorities. Furthermore, it adds the CBAM Certificates capabilities to the CBAM Registry as well as all the Risk Management ones. As the CBAM Certificates and Risk Management modules handle confidential information and monitor cases of circumvention and non-compliance, CBAM Part 3 manages sensitive information and requires highly secure processes. This part will be further maintained and evolved during the Definitive Period. The CBAM Phase 3 Timeline : It starts on the 1 January 2026 and matches with the Definitive Period. During this phase, only the parts 2 & 3 of CBAM will operate in parallel and in close interaction, as the Part 1 was specific for the Transitional Period and is phased out. The user community is extended to the National Customs Administrations.

(2) point 4.1 is amended as follows :  (a) the fourth sentence is replaced by the following:  ‘When reliable data for the exporting country cannot be applied for a type of goods, the default values shall be based on the average emission intensity of the ten exporting countries with the highest emission intensities for which reliable data can be applied for that type of goods.’;  (b) the fifth sentence is deleted;  (3) in point 7 , the second paragraph is replaced by the following:  ‘Where declarants for goods produced in a third country, a group of third countries or a region within a third country can demonstrate, on the basis of reliable data, that alternative region-specific adaptations of default values are lower than the default values determined by the Commission, such region-specific adaptations can be used.’  ANNEX II  The following Annex VII is added:  ‘ANNEX VII  Threshold referred to in Article 2(3a)  1. The threshold referred to in Article 2(3a) shall be set at 50 tonnes of net mass.  2. For determining the threshold, the following methodology shall be applied:  Where:  – is the mass -threshold in tonnes allowing to capture a given target share of emissions;  – Annual emissions per importer; ;  – is the imported volume in tonnes by importer of the CN code ;  – is the number of CN codes imported by importer among the four sectors considered (aluminium, cement, fertilisers, iron and steel);  – is the emission intensity for CN code 1  – : the total emissions in CO2 of the four CBAM sectors considered, that is the sum of corresponding emissions for all importers: , where is the number of importers;  – : the total volume in tonnes of CBAM goods imported by importer ;  – is an indicator function equal to when (that is, when an importer is importing volumes higher than the mass-threshold ), 0 otherwise.  To capture uncertainty over changes in trade patterns while maintaining the environmental objective of this Regulation, a margin of 0.25 percentage points is added to the level of 99% of the embedded emissions as referred to in Article 2(3a) of this Regulation.  For simplicity, the threshold shall be rounded to the nearest ten.  By July of each calendar year, the Commission shall, based on import data covering a reference period of 12 months preceding the month 2 of this assessment, assess whether the value derived from the methodology deviates by more than 5 tonnes from the threshold laid down in point 1.’",['https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-10-2025-0178_EN.html'],"European Parliament legislative resolution of 10 September 2025 on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) 2023/956 as regards simplifying and strengthening the carbon border adjustment mechanism ( COM(2025)0087 – C10-0035/2025 – 2025/0039(COD) )

of 8 October 2025
amending Regulation (EU) 2023/956 as regards simplifying and strengthening the carbon border adjustment mechanism
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192(1) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee(1),
After consulting the Committee of the Regions,
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure(2),
Whereas:
(1) Since the start of the transitional period on 1 October 2023 laid down in Regulation (EU) 2023/956 of the European Parliament and of the Council(3), the Commission has been collecting data and information on the implementation of the carbon border adjustment mechanism (the ‘CBAM’) as provided for therein, including through the analysis of quarterly reports submitted by reporting declarants. The information collected and the exchanges with the stakeholders, including exchanges within the expert group on the CBAM, have indicated areas to simplify and strengthen the CBAM in line with the Union’s commitment to ensure a smooth implementation of the CBAM once the transitional period ends on 1 January 2026.
(2) Based on the experience acquired and data collected during the transitional period on the distribution of importers of goods listed in Annex I of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 into the Union, only a small proportion of those importers account for the vast majority of emissions embedded in imported goods. The derogation applied to the importation of goods of negligible value, namely those not exceeding a total of EUR 150 per consignment, referred to in Article 23 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1186/2009(4)appears insufficient to ensure that the CBAM applies to importers in proportion to the impact of those importers on the emissions covered by Regulation (EU) 2023/956. For importers of small quantities of goods, compliance with reporting and financial obligations laid down in Regulation (EU) 2023/956 could be unduly burdensome. A new derogation should therefore be introduced to exempt from obligations under Regulation (EU) 2023/956 importers of small quantities in terms of mass of goods listed in Annex I of that Regulation, while preserving the environmental objective of the CBAM and its capacity to achieve the envisaged climate objective.
(3) A new threshold based on cumulative net mass of the imported goods in a given calendar year per importer (the ‘single mass-based threshold’) should be introduced in Regulation (EU) 2023/956, and initially be set at a level of 50 tonnes. A single mass-based threshold should apply cumulatively to all goods in the sectors of iron and steel, aluminium, fertilisers and cement. Where the net mass of all goods imported by an importer in a given calendar year does not cumulatively exceed the single mass-based threshold, such an importer, including any importer with the status of an authorised CBAM declarant, should be exempted in a given calendar year from the obligations under Regulation (EU) 2023/956 (the ‘de minimisexemption’). Where, within a relevant calendar year, an importer exceeds the single mass-based threshold, that importer should be subject to obligations under Regulation (EU) 2023/956 in respect of all emissions embedded in all goods imported during that relevant calendar year, including, in particular, the obligation to obtain the status of authorised CBAM declarant, the obligation to submit a CBAM declaration in respect of all emissions embedded in all goods imported in that relevant calendar year and the obligation to purchase and surrender CBAM certificates in respect of all those emissions.
(4) In the electricity and hydrogen sectors, key features such as quantity of imports, trade patterns, customs information and emission intensities differ substantially from those in the iron and steel, aluminium, fertilisers and cement sectors. Those differences imply that making electricity and hydrogen imports subject to a single mass-based threshold would require introducing complex adjustments that would not allow for the substantial reduction of administrative costs for importers in those sectors. Imports of electricity or hydrogen should therefore not be included under thede minimisexemption.
(5) The establishment of the single mass-based threshold that reflects the average emissions intensity of the quantity of the imported goods pursues the objective of ensuring that at least 99 % of emissions embedded in imported goods remain within the scope of the CBAM and that therefore thede minimisexemption applies to no more than 1 % of emissions embedded in imported goods. Thede minimisexemption would represent a robust and targeted approach as it accurately reflects the environmental nature and the climate objective of the CBAM while substantially reducing the CBAM-related administrative burden for importers, the vast majority of whom will be exempted from the obligations under Regulation (EU) 2023/956. At the same time, the CBAM continues to apply to at least 99 % of emissions embedded in the imported goods. Such a single mass-based threshold also eliminates the risk of circumvention through an artificial splitting of consignments by a single importer.
(6) The Commission should each year assess, on the basis of import data for the preceding 12 calendar months, whether a material change has occurred in the average emission intensities of the goods or in the pattern of trade in goods, including practices of circumvention. In order to ensure that at least 99 % of emissions embedded in the imported goods remain within the scope of the CBAM, the Commission should adopt delegated acts in order to amend the single mass-based threshold by using the methodology set out in point 2 of Annex VII of Regulation (EU) 2023/956. To ensure effectiveness and certainty, the Commission should only adopt such acts where the value of the resulting threshold deviates from the applicable threshold by more than 15 tonnes. Where the single mass-based threshold is amended, it should apply as from the beginning of the following calendar year.
(7) To ensure that the derogation is sufficiently targeted, the single mass-based threshold should apply to each importer, including those importers with the status of authorised CBAM declarant. For that purpose, imports of an importer should be taken into account irrespective of whether they have been declared by the importer itself or an indirect customs representative. The indirect customs representative, due to the nature of its activity and the related obligations under Regulation (EU) 2023/956, should always be required to obtain the status of an authorised CBAM declarant prior to acting on behalf of an importer in respect of goods listed in Annex I to Regulation (EU) 2023/956. Where an importer represented by one or more indirect customs representatives has exceeded the single mass-based threshold, each indirect customs representative that is acting as an authorised CBAM declarant should submit a CBAM declaration in respect of the goods imported into the customs territory of the Union by that indirect customs representative, including any goods below the single mass-based threshold, for those represented importers that have exceeded the single mass-based threshold, and should surrender the number of CBAM certificates which correspond to emissions embedded in those goods.
(8) For the purposes of legal certainty, it is appropriate to expressly provide that where an indirect customs representative acts as an authorised CBAM declarant on behalf of an importer, the indirect customs representative should be subject to the obligations applicable to that importer pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2023/956, in particular the obligation to submit a CBAM declaration in respect of the goods imported by the indirect customs representative on behalf of that importer and to surrender the CBAM certificates in respect of emissions embedded in those goods. As a result, in the event of non-compliance, it should be the indirect customs representative that is subject to penalties under Regulation (EU) 2023/956. However, the indirect customs representative should not be subject to penalties where an indirect customs representative acting on behalf of an importer established in a Member State has not agreed to act as an authorised CBAM declarant.
(9) Based on customs information, the Commission should monitor the quantities of goods imported to assess compliance with the single mass-based threshold. The competent authorities should also be able to carry out such monitoring. To allow the competent authorities to make an informed decision, it is necessary to lay down appropriate arrangements for making the necessary information and data available to the competent authorities. Each competent authority should be able to request necessary information and evidence from customs authorities, including the name, address and contact information of importers where such information is not otherwise available to the competent authority. Where the customs authorities become aware that an importer has exceeded the single mass-based threshold, including on the basis of information from the competent authority, they should not allow further importation of goods by that importer until the end of the relevant calendar year, or until that importer has obtained the status of authorised CBAM declarant.
(10) An importer that expects to exceed the annual single mass-based threshold should submit an application for an authorisation. Such an importer should obtain the status of authorised CBAM declarant before the single mass-based threshold is exceeded. Importers that have not been granted the authorisation before exceeding the single mass-based threshold should be subject to penalties.
(11) The obligation to obtain the status of authorised CBAM declarant before the single mass-based threshold is exceeded could result in a high number of applications being lodged at the beginning of 2026. In order to facilitate the application of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 after the expiry of transitional provisions, and avoid potential import disruptions, it is appropriate to allow importers and indirect customs representatives that have submitted an application for an authorisation by 31 March 2026 to continue importing the goods in 2026 even after exceeding the single mass-based threshold pending the decision on granting of the authorisation. In order to avoid circumvention of Regulation (EU) 2023/956, where granting of the authorisation is refused, the importers and indirect customs representatives should be subject to penalties in accordance with Article 26(2a) of that Regulation.
(12) To ensure that the definition of an importer covers all relevant customs procedures, it is necessary to amend it to include the case of the simplified customs procedure where only a bill of discharge is presented pursuant to Article 175(5) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/2446(5).
(13) To achieve a balance between the effectiveness of the authorisation procedure and the risk profile of the applicants, the consultation procedure should be optional for the competent authority. The consultation procedure should allow the competent authority to consult other competent authorities and the Commission where it is considered necessary based on the information submitted by the applicant and customs information made available in the CBAM registry.
(14) To provide additional flexibility, the authorised CBAM declarant should be able to delegate the submission of the CBAM declaration to a third party. The authorised CBAM declarant should remain responsible for the submission of the CBAM declaration. In order to enable the authorised CBAM declarant to provide the required delegation and access to a third party, that third party should fulfil certain technical credentials, including holding an Economic Operators Registration and Identification (EORI) number and being established in a Member State.
(15) Authorised CBAM declarants should submit their annual CBAM declaration and surrender the corresponding number of certificates by 30 September of the year following the year of importation of the goods. In order to provide authorised CBAM declarants flexibility to comply with their obligations, a later date of submission would provide authorised CBAM declarants more time to collect the necessary information, ensure that embedded emissions are verified by an accredited verifier, and purchase the corresponding number of CBAM certificates. The date for the cancellation of CBAM certificates should be adjusted accordingly.
(16) The embedded emissions of some aluminium and steel goods currently included in the scope of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 are primarily determined by the embedded emissions of input materials (precursors), while the emissions arising during the production steps of those goods are typically relatively low. Those production steps consist of finishing processes that are carried out by separate installations not covered by the EU emissions trading system (the ‘EU ETS’) as provided for in Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(6), except for the case of integrated facilities. With a view to ensuring coherence with EU ETS rules and to simplifying the application of CBAM rules for operators in third countries, the embedded emissions of those production processes should be excluded from the system boundaries for the calculation of emissions, by aligning the system boundaries of production processes with those covered by the EU ETS.
(17) Electricity generated on the continental shelf or in the exclusive economic zone of a Member State or a third country is considered as originating in that Member State or that third country, respectively. Hydrogen originating on the continental shelf or in the exclusive economic zone of a Member State or a third country is considered as originating in that Member State or that third country, respectively.
(18) Where input materials (precursors) have already been subject to the EU ETS or to a carbon pricing system that is fully linked with the EU ETS, the embedded emissions of those precursors should not be accounted for in the calculation of the embedded emissions of complex goods.
(19) Authorised CBAM declarants are required to submit an annual CBAM declaration containing the calculation of embedded emissions on the basis of either default values or actual values verified by accredited verifiers. Default values should be calculated and made available by the Commission. The verification of embedded emissions should therefore only apply to actual values.
(20) Information collected during the transitional period indicates that reporting declarants have difficulties in obtaining the required information on the carbon price effectively paid in a third country. To facilitate the deduction of the carbon price, the Commission should, where possible, establish an annual average carbon price expressed in EUR/tonne of CO2e of the effective carbon price paid, including on a conservative basis, based on the best available data from reliable, publicly available information and information provided by third countries to the Commission.
(21) The evidence required for the deduction of a carbon price effectively paid relies on information relevant for the determination and verification of actual embedded emissions. Where the embedded emissions are declared on the basis of default values, it should only be possible to claim the deduction of the carbon price by reference to yearly default carbon prices, where available. Furthermore, since the embedded emissions of precursors should not be accounted for where they have already been subject to the EU ETS or to a carbon pricing system that is fully linked with the EU ETS, the carbon price associated with those embedded emissions is not relevant for the deduction.
(22) Authorised CBAM declarants can claim a reduction in the number of CBAM certificates to be surrendered corresponding to the carbon price effectively paid in the country of origin for the declared embedded emissions. Since the carbon price can be paid in a third country other than the country of origin of the imported goods, such a carbon price should also be eligible for deduction.
(23) To improve the reliability of the data on embedded emissions contained in the CBAM registry and to facilitate the submission of data, accredited verifiers should access, upon request from operators in third countries, the CBAM registry to verify the embedded emissions. In addition, parent companies or controlling entities of those operators should be allowed to access the CBAM registry for the purpose of registering and sharing relevant data on behalf of those operators. The operators should be required to provide a corporate or activity registration number to ensure their identification.
(24) To ensure consistency with Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council(7), as well as Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2067(8), a verifier should be a legal person that is accredited for the purpose of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 by a decision of a national accreditation body. In taking that decision, the national accreditation body should take into account the relevant groups of activities under Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2067 for the assessment of the qualifications of the legal person.
(25) To foster the implementation of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 at national level, Member States should ensure that the competent authorities have all the powers necessary for the performance of their functions and duties.
(26) The costs incurred in connection with the establishment, operation and management of the common central platform should be financed by fees payable by authorised CBAM declarants. For the duration of the first joint public procurement contract for the establishment, operation and management of the common central platform, those costs should initially be borne by the general budget of the Union and, to that end, the revenues generated by those fees should be assigned to the Union budget to cover the relevant costs. In view of the nature of the revenues, it is appropriate to treat the revenues as internal assigned revenues. Any revenues remaining after covering those costs should be assigned to the Union budget. The Commission should be empowered to adopt delegated acts that determine the structure and level of fees so that the organisation and use of the common central platform is cost-efficient, that the fees are set so as to strictly cover the relevant costs and that undue administrative costs are avoided. The Commission should also adopt delegated acts that determine for the duration of the subsequent joint procurement contracts that the fees should directly finance the costs of the operation and management of the platform.
(27) To provide authorised CBAM declarants sufficient time to prepare for compliance with the amended obligations under Regulation (EU) 2023/956, Member States should start selling CBAM certificates in 2027 for emissions embedded in goods imported during the year 2026. The price of CBAM certificates purchased in 2027 and corresponding to emissions embedded in goods imported into the Union in 2026 should reflect the prices of EU ETS allowances in 2026.
(28) The obligation for the authorised CBAM declarants to ensure that the number of CBAM certificates on their account in the CBAM registry at the end of each quarter corresponds to at least 80 % of the emissions embedded in the goods they have imported since the start of the year is insufficiently tailored to the expected financial adjustment. It is therefore necessary to both reduce the percentage from 80 % to 50 % and integrate the free allocation of EU ETS allowances. Furthermore, the authorised CBAM declarant should be able to rely on the information submitted in the CBAM declaration in the previous year for the same goods and same third countries.
(29) Similarly, the repurchase limit should align more accurately with the number of CBAM certificates which the authorised CBAM declarants are required to purchase during the year of importation.
(30) Since CBAM certificates are cancelled without any compensation, there is no need for an exchange of information from the common central platform to the CBAM registry at the end of the working day.
(31) Where an authorised CBAM declarant fails to surrender the correct number of CBAM certificates as a result of incorrect information provided by a third party, namely an operator, a verifier or an independent person certifying the carbon price documentation, the competent authorities, when applying penalties, should be able to take into account the specific circumstances concerned, such as the duration, gravity, scope, intentional or negligent nature or repetition of the non-compliance or the level of cooperation of the authorised CBAM declarant. This would allow for a reduction of the amount of the penalty where minor or unintentional errors are made.
(32) Importers other than authorised CBAM declarants that have exceeded the single mass-based threshold should be subject to a penalty provided in Article 26(2a). For that purpose, the entirety of the emissions embedded in the goods imported by such an importer without authorisation in the relevant calendar year should be taken into account. It is appropriate to provide that the payment of the penalty releases the importer from the obligation to submit a CBAM declaration and surrender CBAM certificates in respect of those imports. In order to take into account a minor infringement or its unintentional nature, the competent authorities should be able to impose a lower penalty where the single mass-based threshold has been exceeded by no more than 10 % of that threshold or where the importer has provisionally continued to import goods and its application for the status of authorised CBAM declarant has been refused.
(33) Regulation (EU) 2023/956 applies to certain carbon-intensive goods imported into the Union. Goods listed in Annex I to Regulation (EU) 2023/956 include ‘other kaolinic clays’ in the list of cement goods. While calcined kaolinic clays are carbon-intensive products, this is not the case for non-calcined kaolinic clays. Non-calcined kaolinic clays should therefore be excluded from the scope of Regulation (EU) 2023/956.
(34) Annex II to Regulation (EU) 2023/956 lists the goods for which only direct emissions should be taken into account in the calculation of embedded emissions. For goods not listed in that Annex, both direct and indirect emissions should be taken into account. Since indirect emissions are not relevant in the case of electricity generation, electricity should be added to the list of goods in that Annex.
(35) It is necessary to simplify the means for determining default values when reliable data for the exporting country would not be available for a certain type of goods. In such cases, to prevent carbon leakage, the default value should be set at the level of the average emission intensity of the 10 exporting countries with the highest emission intensities for which reliable data is available, which is an appropriate average to ensure the environmental objective of the CBAM. This is without prejudice to the possibility to adapt these default values based on region-specific features pursuant to point 7 of Annex IV to Regulation (EU) 2023/956.
(36) In order to supplement and amend certain non-essential elements of Regulation (EU) 2023/956, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of amending the single mass-based threshold in Annex VII to that Regulation, where necessary, as determined in accordance with Article 2(3a) of that Regulation, and supplementing that Regulation in order to determine that the fees payable by authorised CBAM declarants directly finance the costs of the operation and management of the common central platform. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making(9). In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States’ experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.
(37) Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely simplifying certain obligations and strengthening the mechanism that the Union has adopted to prevent the risk of carbon leakage and thereby reduce global carbon emissions, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but can rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives;
(38) In order to allow for the timely adoption of delegated and implementing acts under Regulation (EU) 2023/956, this Regulation should enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in theOfficial Journal of the European Union.
(39) Regulation (EU) 2023/956 should therefore be amended accordingly,

Article 2

This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in theOfficial Journal of the European Union.
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.
Done at Strasbourg, 8 October 2025.",https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202502083,"The European Commission has proposed a regulation to refine and enhance the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), aiming to align carbon pricing for imported goods with those produced within the EU. This initiative seeks to reduce the administrative burden on businesses, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, by simplifying complex reporting requirements and data collection processes. The proposal maintains CBAM's environmental objectives, ensuring it continues to effectively address climate change by aligning carbon pricing for imports with internal EU standards. It also enhances the Commission's ability to monitor and supervise CBAM, improving data processing and information exchange with national authorities to maximize the utility of reported data and better detect risks.

To ease compliance, the proposal introduces a threshold to exempt certain importers from CBAM obligations, targeting those within the CBAM scope with changes to reporting requirements. This threshold considers all imported emissions over a period, applying a mass-based threshold reflecting the average emissions intensity of imported goods in specific sectors cumulatively during a calendar year. Importers established in a Member State must apply for the status of authorized CBAM declarant before importing goods into the EU.

The proposal also includes specific amendments, such as refining the classification of certain goods and adding new tables for greenhouse gas emissions related to electricity. These changes are part of a broader initiative to create a more efficient regulatory environment that supports European competitiveness and resilience. The overarching objective of the CBAM is to address climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions both within the EU and globally.

CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  a) Security of supply  The EU’s energy-security challenges are mainly linked to its primary energy supply dependence on non-EU countries. With the introduction of the European Green Deal, the EU has set out important steps it will take to reduce its dependence on imported fossil fuels by setting ambitious renewables and energy-efficiency targets. However, the 2022 energy crisis and the energy-price shock that followed highlighted the need to do more and take further steps to decrease the EU’s dependency on non-EU sources of primary energy. In particular, the REPowerEU plan sets out important steps to shield households and businesses from supply shocks by: (i) strengthening underground storage capacity of gas; (ii) upgrading and extending liquefied-natural-gas infrastructure; and (iii) diversifying both the sources and routes of pipeline gas.  To deliver on these objectives, the extension of some of the measures, mainly the November gas storage filling target, adopted previously for a limited period of time, is necessary. At the same time, market conditions have changed. With this proposal, and building upon the Commission Recommendation adopted today, the Commission aims to ensure energy security and resilience of the European union energy system while supporting Member States by providing an even higher degree of flexibility on filling trajectories to fulfil filling targets for gas storage at their own pace, reducing system stress and minimizing the room for market distortions.  b) Role of gas storage, current problems and flexibility  Gas storage contributes to security of supply by providing additional supply if there is strong demand or if supply is disrupted. Storage supplies 25-30% of gas consumed in the EU in winter. During the heating season, storage reduces the need to import additional gas and helps to absorb supply shocks.  Recognising this fact, and taking actions against both the weaponisation of Russian gas supplies and market volatility, the Commission drafted in spring 2022 – and the co-legislators quickly approved – amendments to Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 on the security of gas supply with regard to gas storage. 1 The amendments introduced a target to ensure that gas - storage facilities were 90% full by 1 November (filling target), with a series of intermediate targets for each Member State in February, May, July and September of the year thereafter (filling trajectory) . At the same time, the amendments introduced certification requirements for storage system operators (SSOs) to improve control over strategic assets and avoid the risk of there being insufficient gas in storage ahead of the winter .  As a consequence of these amendments, the dramatic 2022 scenario of price spikes in gas was not repeated in 2023 or 2024, and the obligation to certify SSOs eliminated the practice (which occurred in 2021) where some of the third-party owned gas-storage facilities were intentionally filled below capacity or late ahead of the winter months.  The European gas market remains tight. The competition for global LNG supplies has increased and exposure to price volatility is stronger than before. This is evidenced by the gas market price development during winter 2024/2025.  From the security of supply perspective, the existence of a storage filling target and filling trajectory fosters predictability and sends important signals to market players. Under this framework, actions undertaken by the EU have improved the situation since 2022. However, ultimately, the single most important objective is to strengthen the security of supply of the EU energy system in particular for the winter, which translates into the compliance of Member States with the mandatory 1 November target.  At the same time, the overall framework to meet this 1 November target must be flexible enough during the filling season to allow a swift reaction to constantly changing market conditions and in particular to take advantage of the best purchasing conditions. The purpose of intermediary filling targets, agreed upon each year by the Member States, is to ensure that the mandatory 1 November target is met. However, these targets are indicative and if necessary, can be modified in such a way that there is maximum flexibility available for market participants throughout the year. Such approach combined with better coordination among Member States, guarantees sufficient level of flexibility to fill storage at their own pace, while reducing system stress and avoiding market distortions.  The Commission will continue to closely monitor the filling of the storage facilities, and through coordination and active dialogue with the Member States, including via the Gas Coordination Group, will make sure that potential substantial and sustained deviations from the filling trajectories do not endanger security of supply and that potential risks are mitigated. In addition, the Commission will do a comprehensive assessment as part of the review of the security of supply framework to examine the added value of any permanent storage measures for security of supply post 2027.  c) Objective of the proposal  The amendments in Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 on gas storage are set to expire at the end of 2025. The continuing tight situation in the global gas-market calls for an extension of these provisions beyond 2025.  At the same time, the European Commission plans to review the EU’s energy-security framework, including by making an assessment as to whether a potential legislative proposal should incorporate permanent storage-filling measures for Member States. However, this proposal is not planned for next year.  A temporary extension of the existing gas-storage provisions is necessary to continue providing predictability and transparency in the use of gas-storage facilities across the EU.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  The gas-storage provisions in Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 were introduced through Regulation (EU) 2022/1032 for a period of three years. The provisions expire at the end of 2025. The proposal aims to extend the existing provision by a further two years on a temporary basis until a new energy-security framework is potentially put in place, most likely in the course of 2027. The extension would be consistent with the existing policy and would help to improve energy security and gas-market stability. The proposal for prolongation does not aim to alter any other aspects of the gas-storage provisions.  • Consistency with other Union policies  Following geopolitical developments, in March 2022, the Commission issued the ‘REPowerEU’ Communication for a joint European action to promote more affordable, secure and sustainable energy. Consequently, the Commission presented a legislative proposal (the Gas Storage Regulation – Regulation (EU) 2022/1032) to ensure a sufficient level of annual storage from winter 2022/2023 and into the future.  As part of a fitness check of the current energy-security framework, the Commission launched a public consultation to gather the views of a broad range of stakeholders on the benefits and possible future challenges facing Europe in the area of energy security. The public consultation, concluded at the end of November 2024, is also taking stock of the gas-storage provisions and their contribution to overall energy security.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  This proposal amends Regulation (EU) 2017/1938, the legal base of which was Article 194(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. This proposal is based on Article 194(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  The planned measures of the present initiative are fully in line with the subsidiarity principle. There is a need for an EU-level action because interruption to the EU’s gas supply: (i) poses high risks; (ii) would have significant effects on many Member States; and (iii) would affect gas prices across the EU.  • Proportionality  The initiative complies with the proportionality principle. Although the ultimate annual filling target for 1 November is laid down through the Regulation, the targets take into account the situation of individual Member States and the size of the gas-storage facilities located on their respective territories. Exemptions/derogations laid down by Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 relate to the Netherlands (Article 6a.3) and also to Austria, Czechia, Hungary, Latvia, and Slovakia (Article 6a.2). The proposed 90% filling rate is a necessary and appropriate level to ensure security of supply over the winter in the event of serious supply disruptions, without putting an excessive burden on Member States, energy companies or the public.  Intermediary filling targets are laid down on an annual basis, after consultation with the Member States (through their participation in the Gas Coordination Group). These targets allow for a sufficient level of flexibility for Member States to reflect both the existing energy situation as well as gas-market fundamentals.  • Choice of the instrument  This is a proposal to amend Regulation (EU) 2017/1938, and therefore the instrument chosen is an amending Regulation. Given that this is not a full revision of the Regulation, a recast is not considered appropriate.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  This proposal is accompanied by a report on the implementation and impact of gas-storage provisions, which concludes that both the gas-storage filling trajectories and the certification process for gas-storage facilities have had a positive impact on the security of energy supply.  The Commission submits annual reports, prepared in consultation with Member States, that include an analysis of the potential effects of the Regulation on gas prices and potential gas savings.  Additionally, as part of the fitness check of the energy-security framework, and in order to gather the views of a wide range of stakeholders, the Commission launched a public consultation. The consultation process was launched in September 2024 and lasted until November 2024. Over 100 participants provided insights and views to the consultation, including on the role of gas storage in the overall energy-security framework. Upon analysing the results of the public consultation, the Commission may conclude that a wider revision of the energy-security framework is needed and, in that context, may propose a continuation of the mandatory intermediate and ultimate annual targets for storage filling. However, the revision process is likely to last at least two years. Recognising the significant role that gas storage has played so far in boosting the energy security of Member States, a temporary prolongation of the mandatory filling target and of the intermediary targets requirement is considered necessary.  • Stakeholder consultations  As part of the public consultation related to the fitness check, stakeholders were consulted on the importance of gas storage and the utility of setting mandatory filling targets.  • Collection and use of expertise  During 2025, as part of the fitness check of the overall energy-security framework, the Commission intends to mandate an external contractor to carry out an impact assessment. The contractor would also be asked to collect external views and expertise at the same time.  • Impact assessment  As mentioned in the paragraph above, the Commission intends to carry out an impact assessment during 2025. Questions related to the gas-storage provisions will be part of the impact assessment. Due to the shortness of time remaining and the expiration of current provisions in December 2025, no impact assessment is being carried out for this temporary measure.  • Fundamental rights  The measure will enable support to be targeted at some of the most vulnerable customers, and in particular those already experiencing energy poverty.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  The impact on the EU budget associated with this proposal concerns the staffing and other administrative expenditures of the European Commission’s Directorate-General (DG) for Energy. The proposal seeks to prolong provisions improving the EU’s architecture for the security of its gas supply. These prolonged provisions would entail continued obligations for Member States and, correspondingly, a continued strengthened role for DG Energy in a wide range of areas identified in the original proposal, namely:  · o verall management and implementation of the Regulation (1 FTE) ;  · m anagement of the strengthened r ole of the Gas Coordination Group (0.5 FTE s ) ;  · m onitoring of filling rates and drawing up of technical implementation specifications , such as filling trajectories (including economic and technical analysis and data management) (1.5 FTE s ) ;  · a ssessment of the notifications on burden-sharing set out in A rticle 6c (1 FTE) ;  · a dministrative support (1 FTE).  In addition, the implementation, coordination and follow-up of this amending regulation among Member States will require additional administrative appropriations of up to EUR 150 000 a year for official trips and expert meetings, in particular meetings of the Gas Coordination Group.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  All current gas-storage-related provisions of Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 introduced by Regulation (EU) 2022/1032 would remain unchanged except the Article setting the application/validity date, which would be changed to 31 December 2027.  2025/0051 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  Amending Regulation (EU)2017/1938 as regards the role of gas storage for securing gas supplies ahead of the winter season  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 194(2) thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) Regulation (EU) 2022/1032 of the Parliament and of the Council 2 was adopted in reaction to the gas-supply crisis and unprecedented price increases caused by the escalation of the Russian military aggression against Ukraine since February 2022, impelling the Union to act in a coordinated and comprehensive manner to avoid potential risks resulting from further gas - supply disruptions .  (2) Regulation (EU) 2022/1032 amended Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 by introducing a temporary legal framework for measures regarding the filling level of underground storage facilities to strengthen the security of gas supply in the Union, in particular gas supplies to protected customers.  (3) Gas-storage facilities provide for 30% of the Union’s gas consumption during the winter months, and well-filled underground gas-storage facilities contribute substantially to the security of gas supply by providing additional gas in the event of high demand or supply disruptions.  (4) The laying down of a mandatory target to ensure that gas-storage facilities are 90% full by 1 November (filling target), with a series of intermediate targets for each Member State in February, May, July and September of the year thereafter (filling trajectory), proved to be fundamental amidst the energy crisis sparked by the weaponisation of Russian gas supplies and invasion of Ukraine in both: (i) weathering the gas-supply shortages; and (ii) reducing market uncertainties and price volatility.  (5) Despite the substantial improvement of the gas market situation compared to 2022-2023 period, the European gas market remains tight. More intense competition for global LNG supplies can increase Member States exposure to price volatility . The gas price development during the 2024/2025 winter may confirm the trend. In such situation, the role of gas storages remains paramount. Predictable filling trajectories increase transparency and prevent market distortion.  (6) Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 the obligation of the Member States to follow an annual filling trajectory and to ensure that the filling target is achieved by 1 November of each year expires on 31 December 2025.  (7) At the same time, the overall framework to meet this 1 November target must be flexible enough during the filling season to allow a swift reaction to constantly changing market conditions and in particular to take advantage of the best purchasing conditions.  (8) The purpose of intermediary filling targets, agreed upon each year by the Member States, is to ensure that the mandatory 1 November target is met. However, these targets are indicative and should allow for storage filling in such a way that there is sufficient flexibility available for market participants throughout the year in accordance with Recommendation XXX .

of 18 July 2025
amending Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 as regards the role of gas storage for securing gas supplies ahead of the winter season
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 194(2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee(1),
After consulting the Committee of the Regions,
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure(2),
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EU) 2022/1032 of the European Parliament and of the Council(3)was adopted in reaction to the gas supply crisis and the unprecedented increases in gas prices caused by Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine since February 2022, impelling the Union to act in a coordinated and comprehensive manner to avoid potential risks resulting from further gas supply disruptions.
(2) Since the start of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, the Union aims to further advance its independence from Russian energy. This highlights the urgency to ensure alternative energy supplies from international partners via LNG or pipeline gas, without creating new dependencies. In that context, securing alternative energy supplies from reliable partners will be critical. On 17 June 2025, the Commission presented a proposal for a regulation to fully phase out Russian gas imports into the Union, which includes, in particular, an amendment to Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 of the European Parliament and of the Council(4). In addition, the Commission’s proposal includes measures allowing for the introduction of a robust and efficient system of tracking the Russian gas that crosses the Union’s border. Such measures would also help with monitoring whether the Russian gas is stored in the Union. The full phase out of Russian gas imports will allow for the reinforcement of the provisions on gas storage laid down in Regulation (EU) 2017/1938, helping the Union to have a more resilient energy system. In view of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, the Union should progress quickly towards full independence from Russian fossil fuels. Extending the measures regarding the filling level of gas storage facilities would not only contribute to the continued safeguarding of security of supply, but would also constitute a key instrument in the Union’s efforts to eliminate its dependence on imports of gas originating in Russia.
(3) Regulation (EU) 2022/1032 amended Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 by introducing a temporary legal framework for measures regarding the filling level of gas storage facilities to strengthen the security of gas supply in the Union, in particular gas supplies to protected customers.
(4) Gas-storage facilities store gas amounting to 30 % of the Union’s gas consumption during the winter months, and well-filled underground gas storage facilities as well as voluntary gas demand reduction contribute substantially to the security of gas supply by providing additional gas in the event of tight supply and demand adequacy or supply disruptions.
(5) The laying down of a binding filling target and a filling trajectory with a series of intermediate targets for each Member State in February, May, July and September to ensure that gas storage facilities are 90 % full by 1 November of a respective year, proved to be fundamental during the energy crisis sparked by Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine for the purpose of both weathering the gas supply shortages and reducing market uncertainties and price volatility.
(6) Despite the substantial improvement in the state of the gas market compared to the period 2022-2023, the European gas market remains tight and the geopolitical situation remains unclear. More intense competition for global LNG supplies can increase Member States’ exposure to price volatility. In those cases, the role of gas storage remains paramount.
(7) Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2017/1938, the obligation of the Member States to follow an annual filling trajectory and to ensure that the filling target is met by 1 November of each year expires on 31 December 2025.
(8) The changed global political environment has to be taken into account with regard to the reliability of gas suppliers and gas-supplying countries.
(9) In light of the European success in reducing the risks associated with its gas import structure, the overall framework to meet the Union’s need for gas should strike a balance between energy security and the return to market-based principles. It should therefore be flexible enough during the filling season to allow for a swift reaction to constantly changing market conditions and, in particular, to take advantage of the best purchasing conditions in order to reduce gas prices in Europe. In particular, it should be possible for Member States to meet the filling target at any point in time between 1 October and 1 December, taking into account the start of the Member States’ gas storage withdrawal period, without being required to maintain the storage level corresponding to the filling target until 1 December.
(10) The purpose of filling trajectories, set by Member States each year to represent their annual filling plan, is to ensure that the binding filling target is met within the timeframe from 1 October to 1 December in a given year. However, the filling trajectory should be indicative and should allow for storage-filling in such a way that there is sufficient flexibility available for market participants throughout the year, taking into account Commission Recommendation C(2025)1481 of 5 March 2025 on the implementation of the gas storage filling targets in 2025.
(11) In the case of difficult conditions, such as indications of trading activities hindering cost-effective storage filling, low seasonal price spread, high price environment, storage levels below the trajectory at Member State level or unforeseen technical circumstances that would make storage injection difficult and costly, limiting the ability to ensure that the gas storages are filled in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017/1938, Member States should have the possibility to deviate from the filling target by up to ten percentage points.
(12) Moreover, in the case of persistent unfavourable market conditions, such as indications of possible market manipulation, or of trading activities hindering cost-effective storage-filling, that significantly limit the ability to ensure that the gas storages are filled in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017/1938, the Commission should be empowered to further increase the level of deviation allowed by means of a delegated act. That increase should not exceed an additional five percentage points.
(13) The Commission’s assessment of the current energy security framework has confirmed the positive impact of the storage-filling requirements on the security of gas supply, and those positive effects should be preserved beyond 2025.
(14) At the same time, this Regulation should respond to current and future changes in the gas markets, contribute to the strategic objective of bringing down energy prices and facilitate the gradual return towards market-based mechanisms for storage-refilling.
(15) In order to maintain the security of supply and the appropriate level of filling of gas storage facilities, the Commission should continuously monitor the market and explore ways that could help meet the filling target, including by making more effective use of the opportunities offered by the demand aggregation and joint purchasing mechanism set up under Council Regulation (EU) 2022/2576(5).
(16) It is therefore necessary to extend until the end of 2027 the relevant gas storage-filling provisions that provide predictability and transparency as to the utilisation of gas storage facilities across the Union, while at the same time introducing some flexibility into those provisions.
(17) Considering that the relevant gas storage-filling provisions should apply as a matter of urgency before the start of the next winter season in order for Member States to meet their target in time, this Regulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication in theOfficial Journal of the European Union.
(18) In line with the principles of better regulation and simplification, and reflecting the overall improvement in the Union’s energy security framework, this Regulation should avoid introducing unnecessary administrative complexity.
(19) As outlined in the Commission communication of 26 February 2025 entitled ‘Action Plan for Affordable Energy’, the recent energy crisis, the most severe Europe has seen yet, underscored the importance of EU-level coordination in managing price spikes in the internal market. To increase resilience in the face of any possible future energy crisis, Member States need tools for effective action and the security of supply regulatory framework needs to be strengthened, incorporating the lessons learned from recent developments. Among other issues, the concept of protected customers, the prevention of the distortion of competition and the proper functioning of the internal market, as well as the role of energy sources alternative to gas such as renewable energy sources and hydrogen, together with the role of energy efficiency, in an evolving energy mix should be given due consideration.
(20) Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 should therefore be amended accordingly,

Done at Brussels, 18 July 2025.",https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202501733,"The European Commission has proposed a regulation to amend existing legislation concerning the role of gas storage in securing gas supplies ahead of the winter season. This proposal, submitted to the European Parliament, aims to extend measures initially introduced to address the 2022 energy crisis, which underscored the EU's reliance on non-EU energy sources. The proposal seeks to bolster the EU's energy security by enhancing underground gas storage capacity, upgrading liquefied natural gas infrastructure, and diversifying gas sources and routes.

A central element of the proposal is the extension of the November gas storage filling target, which mandates that gas storage facilities be 90% full by November 1st. This target, along with intermediate targets set for February, May, July, and September, is designed to ensure a stable gas supply during the winter months. The proposal also introduces flexibility for Member States to adjust their filling trajectories based on market conditions, allowing them to respond swiftly to changes and capitalize on favorable purchasing opportunities.

The proposal underscores the importance of gas storage in maintaining supply security, as it provides additional supply during periods of high demand or disruptions. Amendments introduced in 2022, including certification requirements for storage system operators, have helped prevent price spikes and ensure sufficient gas reserves. The Commission will continue to monitor storage levels and coordinate with Member States to mitigate risks and ensure compliance with the November target. The proposal also includes a commitment to review the security of supply framework post-2027 to assess the long-term value of permanent storage measures.

CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  T he Competitiveness Compass 1 is guid ing the economic policy of the Commission in the current mandate . It b uild s on the European Council ’s Budapest Declaration 2 and the Antwerp Declaration 3 of European business and trade union representatives . The Competitiveness Compass defines a joint roadmap for decarbonisation and competitiveness as one of three transformational imperatives to boost competitiveness .  This imperative is developed in the Clean Industrial Deal 4 . It aims to strengthen the EU’s competitiveness while remaining on track to achieve climate neutrality. The focus is on supporting and creating the right conditions for companies to achieve this goal. It also aims to increase the EU’s economic and ener gy security by decreasing its dependence on imported fossil fuels and increasing the share of energy produce d from decarbonised generation with in the EU .  The Competitiveness Compass and the Clean Industrial Deal pay particular attention to the automotive sector . Th is sector is undergoing a profound and transformative shift , driven by technological changes such as digitali s ation and decarboni s ation. With this in mind , t he Commission has adopted an I ndustrial A ction P lan for the European automotive sector 5 .  These three strategies identify decarbonisation as a powerful driver of growth and put forward concrete measures to provide EU industries with a stronger business case for clean production. The action plan contains specific incentives to boost the uptake of zero-emission vehicles, including heavy-duty vehicles.  In 2022, the h eavy-duty road transport sector cause d 27. 5 % of road transport CO 2 emissions 6 despite making up only 2.4% of the vehicle fleet 7 . CO 2 emissions in th e heavy-duty road transport sector account ed for more than 6.9 % of all emissions in the EU and were 2 0 % higher than in 199 5 .  Road freight transport is a ‘hard-to-abate sector’, meaning that the cost of reducing its emissions is higher than in other economy sectors. Furthermore, the market of road freight transport services is highly competitive and is characterised by low profit margins, which constrain investment in expensive abatement technologies such as zero-emission vehicles.  I nnovation from heavy-duty vehicles manufacturers ha s in recent years led to the roll - out of zero-emission models that cover all use cases , including long-haul 8 . The ir deployment has increased substantially since 2019 9 . I n 2024 , 3.9 % of all new heavy-duty vehicles were zero-emission vehicle s 10 , including 1 . 2% of new heavy goods vehicles weighing more than 12 tonnes. However , t he share of zero-emission vehicles in the heavy-duty vehicle fleet remains extremely low 11 .  T he 2025 CO 2 reduction target for heavy-duty vehicles of 15% compared with 2019 values 12 can be achieved through efficiency improvements in conventional vehicles, but the deployment of zero-emission vehicles must rapidly increase to achieve subsequent targets 13 . However, the upfront investment for acquiring a zero-emission vehicle is approximately 2.5 time s higher than the cost of equivalent conventional vehicles 14 and remains one of the main barriers to the ir wide r deployment.  Unlike the market for passenger cars, the market for heavy-duty vehicles is a business-to-business market. Investment choices are driven by a vehicle’s cost over its entire lifetime . This is known as the total cost of ownership 15 (TCO) . The market for heavy-duty vehicles is price sensitive . This means that the purchase decision of operators when investing in a new vehicle is likely to be driven by the vehicle’s TCO . In other words, operators will have a business case to invest in a zero-emission vehicle once its cost become s lower than the cost of a conventional vehicle powered by fossil fuels.  Differentiated road charges may reduce operational costs and therefore the TCO of zero-emission vehicles. They can thus help to build a stronger business case for investing in those vehicles.  Directive (EU) 2022/362 16 enabled r oad charging 17 on the basis of CO 2 emissions. Directive (EU) 2022/362 amended Directive 1999/62/EC 18 by provid ing , among other changes , for the variation of infrastructure and user charges ( favouring the deployment of cleaner vehicles ) and/ or for the internalisation of externa l costs of CO 2 ( penalising vehicles that are more polluting ) . Both measures reduce the gap between the TCO of conventional vehicles and the TCO of zero-emission vehicles.  V ariation of road charges consists in granting a 50% to 75% reduction in infrastructure or user charges for zero-emission vehicles 19 . The external-cost charge adds the external cost for traffic-based CO 2 emissions to the infrastructure charge. The Directive provides for reference values for this charge , based on a CO 2 price of EUR 100 per tonne of CO 2 emitted 20 .  The Directive further strengthen s those two mechanisms by allowing Member States to set greatly reduced rates or even grant a full exemption for zero - emission vehicles from the infrastructure or user charge until 31 December 2025 21 . I t also allows Member State s to apply higher external-cost charge s for traffic-based CO 2 emissions up to twice the reference values of the Directive 22 .  T he monetary support in a Member State that makes full use of the se provisions to incentivise an operator to invest in a zero-emission motor vehicle that can weigh up to 40 tonnes is estimated to be as high as EUR 45 000 in the first year of operation 23 . S maller vehicles receiv e a lower level of support . For some use cases, the Directive helps to achiev e cost parity between zero-emission heavy-duty vehicles and conventional vehicles 24 .  The transposition of these provisions into national legislation was due to be completed by 25 March 2024. The option of applying significantly reduced rates to zero-emission vehicles or exempting them from infrastructure or user charges is due to end on 31 December 2025. This period is too short to sufficiently incentivise demand for new zero-emission heavy-duty vehicles.  The Commission therefore proposes to extend the applicability of this exemption. To support European manufacturers in achieving their target of reducing CO 2 emissions from new heavy-duty vehicles by 43% in the 2030 reporting period (as laid down in Regulation (EU) 2019/1242), the Commission proposes that the exemption should be extended until the end of the 2030 reporting period, which ends on 30 June 2031. This change would ensure a coherent legislative framework.  The current exemption is due to end on 31 December 2025 and national authorities would have to transpose the provisions of the currently proposed Directive into national law. The Commission is therefore inviting the European Parliament and Council to consider fast-tracking the adoption of this proposal.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  This proposal would prolong an existing provision that has been recently introduced and is therefore consistent with the existing policy framework on road charging. Where implemented, this provision had a positive impact on creating a business case for zero-emission vehicles. The exemption from infrastructure or user charges complements the application of external-cost charges because both measures reduce the gap between the operational costs and thus between the TCOs of zero-emission and conventional vehicles. Both measures are therefore important in strengthening the business case for investment in zero-emission vehicles.  • Consistency with other Union policies  Th is proposal exten ds a measure on the demand side of the market for new heavy-duty vehicles in order to accelerate their deployment . I t therefore complements the CO2 emission performance standards of the H eavy-duty V ehicles Regulation 25 , which act s on the supply side of the market for new heavy-duty vehicles, and which set s out a 43% CO2 reduction target for manufacturers by 2030 ( and subsequent higher targets until 2040 ) . Manufacturers can achieve the targets by (i) improving the efficiency of conventional vehicles ; and/or (ii) increasing the number of zero-emission vehicles that they put on the market . This proposal helps manufacturer s ramp up the deployment of zero-emission vehicles .  T he internalisation of the cost of carbon reduces the gap in the TCO between cleaner vehicles and more polluting vehicles by increas ing the operational costs of conventional vehicles . Directive 1999/62/EC internalis es the cost of carbon by imposi ng an external-cost charge. From 2027, road transport emissions will also be covered by the emission trading system in Directive 2003/87/EC ( ETS2 ) 26 . The consistency between th ose two measures will be the subject of a r eport from the Commission that will be presented by 2027, in accordance with Articles 7cb ( 4 ) and 7ga ( 8 ) of Directive 1999/62/EC. The assessment will also address the effect of energy taxation on carbon pricing , as regulated under Council Directive 2003/96/EC 27 .  R echarging infrastructure is a n enabling condition for the faster deployment of zero-emission heavy-duty vehicles. The recently revised TEN-T Regulation 28 and the Alternative Fuel s Infrastructure Regulation 29 set targets for the deployment of recharging and hydrogen refuelling stations , including specific targets for heavy-duty transport . Furthermore, t he i ndustrial a ction p lan for the EU’s automotive sector stated that the Commission will work on European Clean Transport Corridors in order to fast-track the deployment of heavy-duty vehicle charging hubs . It also stated that additional proposals will be made in the upcoming Sustainable Transport Investment Plan .  In order to reduce CO 2 emissions, it is essential to shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources . Renewable energy became the leading source of electricity production in the EU in 2023 30 . However, expanding the electricity grid infrastructure is equally important to support this transition . G rid connections are crucial for the deployment of the recharging infrastructure for heavy-duty transport . Several actions are already planned under t he EU Action Plan for Grids 31 and this will also be supplemented by the Grid Package and the Electrification Action Plan . The Commission will issue Guidance and Recommendations to the Member States on shortening the waiting time for recharging points’ connections to grids and their priority treatment and will recommend that Member States consider that charging stations and their connection to the grid are in the overriding public interest in the context of permitting procedures.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  The legal bases of Directive 1999/62/EC are Articles 91 and 113 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). This proposal pertains to the imposition of road charges on vehicles, an area to which Article 91(1) TFEU applies. The legal basis of this proposal is therefore Article 91(1) TFEU.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  The EU shares competence with Member States to regulate in the field of transport pursuant to Article 4(2)(g) TFEU, but only the EU can adapt the existing EU rules. Directive 1999/62/EC defines the cases in which reductions or exemptions from tolls and user charges may be granted. National authorities have discretion in deciding how to use those possibilities. The significantly reduced rates or exemption for zero-emission vehicles from infrastructure or user charges can only be extended beyond the end of 2025 by amending the Directive. The choice of whether to make use of this possibility or not lies with the national authorities.  • Proportionality  The proposed measures do not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the EU’s objectives of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, while also ensuring fairness and environmental integrity.  • Choice of the instrument  The legal act to be amended is a Directive, so the amending act should take the same form.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  The short time that has elapsed since the new rules had to be implemented (i.e. 25 March 2024) means that there is not sufficient information for a fully-fledged ex post evaluation of Directive (EU) 2022/362. Moreover, this proposal would merely extend a provision that already exists.  • Stakeholder consultations  While preparing this proposal, the Commission held targeted consultations with specific stakeholders, including transport operators’ and vehicle manufacturers’ associations, civil society and national authorities.  • Collection and use of expertise  The Commission has relied on publicly available information to assess both the current level of deployment of zero-emission vehicles and the effectiveness of the exemption from infrastructure or user charges. All sources used by the Commission are available in the footnotes to the text in Section 1 above.  • Impact assessment  The Commission conducted a n impact assessment accompanying the proposal which led to the adoption of Directive (EU) 2022/362 32 . The current proposal only amends the end date of an optional provision . There is therefore no need to conduct a new impact assessment .  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  This proposal would merely change a date and therefore does not have any consequences for the simplification of EU law.  • Fundamental rights  The proposal respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  The extension of the exemption from infrastructure or user charges has no implications for the EU’s budget.  The Directive ’s provision s would have different implications for national budgets depending on the Member States’ individual implementation strateg ies . R educ ing or exempti ng cleaner vehicles from road charges may negative ly impact revenues and therefore national budgets unless the average rate for other vehicles is increased 33 . Conversely, e xternal-cost charges generate revenue and positive ly impact national budgets. The Directive offers th r ee options to Member States , which may implement:  road charge reductions or exemptions in order to incentivise investment in cleaner vehicles;  external-costs charges in order to factor those external costs into the investment decisions of the private sector;  both these instruments simultaneously in order to maximise the reduction in the TCO gap between conventional vehicles and zero-emission vehicles.  In the short and medium terms (i.e. the temporal scope of this proposal ) , t he potential negative effect of road charges reductions on national budgets can be expected to be less than the positive effect of external-cost charges . The reason is that today zero-emission vehicles are still a very small part of the vehicle fleet 34 and by 2030 they are expected to be 5% to 9% of the heavy-duty vehicle fleet 35 . Accordingly , if both instruments are applied simultaneously , the revenues from external-cost charges can be expected to be greater than the foregone revenues of road charges reductions or exemptions . The use of the revenues generated by road charges (infrastructure or user charges) and by external-cost charges is regulated under Article 9(2) of Directive 1999/62/EC.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  Article 11 of Directive 1999/62/EC sets a five-yearly reporting obligation. The latest deadline was 25 March 2025, and the next deadline will be 25 March 2030. Article 11(2)(c) requires reporting on ‘ the variation of infrastructure charges or user charges according to the environmental performance of vehicles, pursuant to Article 7g, 7ga or 7gb ;’. The next deadline is before the proposed end date of the exemption and will therefore be appropriate for assessing its implementation. No additional reporting obligation is therefore planned.  • Explanatory documents (for directives)  This proposal would prolong an existing optional provision, so no explanatory document is required. Member States that use this option should nevertheless inform the Commission.  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  Article 1 amends the fifth subparagraph of Article 7ga(1) of Directive 1999/62/EC by extending the exemption laid down in that provision until 30 June 2031.  Article 2 requires Member States to immediately inform the Commission of measures taken pursuant to this Directive.  Article 3 sets the date of entry into force of the Directive.  Article 4 specifies that the Directive is addressed to the Member St ates.  2025/0188 (COD)  Proposal for a  DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Directive 1999/62/EC as regards the extension of the period in which zero-emission heavy-duty vehicles can benefit from significantly reduced rates of infrastructure or user charges or from exemptions to pay them  (Text with EEA relevance)  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 91(1) thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 36 ,  Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions 37 ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) T he registration figures of new zero-emission heavy-duty vehicles ha ve recently increased in the Union but remain too low to achieve the CO 2 emission reduction targets of the transport sector set in the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy 38 . O ne of the main barriers to wider deployment of zero-emission heavy-duty vehic les is t he high upfront cost of acquir ing such a vehicle . Securing a strong er business case for investing in zero-emission vehicles means working towards cost parity with conventional vehicles. T he total cost of ownership consist s of the upfront investment made to acquir e the vehicle and the operati onal costs incurred during the vehicle ’s lifetime . The gap of th e total cost of ownership between co n ve n tio nal and zero-emission vehicles can be reduced by lowering the operati onal costs of zero-emission vehicles . Th o se costs include road charges .  (2) Directive (EU) 2022/362 of the European Parliament and of the Council 39 amended Directive 1999/62/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 40 by, among other changes, making it possible to set road charges according to vehicles’ CO 2 emissions. It introduced the possibility to vary infrastructure and user charges and /or to internalise the externa l costs of CO 2 emissions . Both measures affect the operati onal costs of vehicles . The variation of charges decreases the operati onal costs of less-polluting vehicles , while externa l -cost charges increase the operati onal costs of more - polluting vehicles. Both measures reduce the gap in the total cost of ownership between zero-emission and conventional vehicles . Both measures are important to strengthen ing the business case for invest ing in zero-emission vehicles .  (3) Article 7ga(1), fifth subparagraph, of Directive 1999/62/EC currently gives Member States the possibility to apply reduced rates of infrastructure or user charges without putting any ceiling on such reductions, or to apply full exemption s from such charge s , only until 31 December 2025. Member States were required to transpose th at provision , introduced by Directive (EU) 2022/362 , into national law s by 25 March 2024 . T hat end date for transposition implies a very short implementation period of less than two years . Th at period is too short to meaningfully incentivise the demand of new zero-emission heavy-duty vehicles . Therefore t h at end date should be postponed in order t o create the right conditions for the wider deployment of zero-emission vehicles.  (4) The variation of road charges affects investment decisions of transport operators acquiring a new vehicle . It therefore has an effect on the demand side of the market for new heavy-duty vehicles . Heavy-duty v ehicle manufacturers constitute the supply side of the same market . They have a CO 2 emis s ions reduction target of 43% by 2030 , as set out in Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 of the European Parliament and of the Council 41 . While e fficient conventional vehicles also contribut e to the achievement of th is target, the wider deployment of zero-emission vehicles is necessary in order to achiev e it . The first year when manufacturers are to achieve th at target is the reporting period 2030, with a deadline of 30 June 2031.  (5) T o ensure a clear and coherent legal framework and to support Union companies in the automotive sector in achieving the ir CO 2 emissions reduction targets, the timing of the measures on the demand and supply side of the market of heavy-duty vehicles should be aligned . T he end date until when it is possible for Member States to apply significantly reduced rates of infrastructure or user charges or to exempt zero-emission vehicles from such charges should therefore be postponed until 30 June 2031 .  (6) T he optional nature of the amended provision means that Member States are not obliged to transpose this Directive . T hey should nevertheless immediately inform the Commission if they use the option to grant zero-emission vehicles significantly reduced rates of infrastructure and user charges or exempt ions to pay them after 31 December 2025 ,  HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:  Article 1  In of Article 7ga(1), fifth subparagraph, of Directive 1999/62/EC, the date ‘31 December 2025’ is replaced by ‘30 June 2031’, and the date ‘1 January 2026’ is replaced by ‘1 July 2031’.  Article 2  Member States shall immediately inform the Commission of measures taken pursuant to this Directive.  Article 3  This Directive shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union .

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 91(1) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1) ,
After consulting the Committee of the Regions,
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2) ,
Whereas:
(1)  The registration figures of new zero-emission heavy-duty vehicles in the Union have recently increased but remain too low to achieve the CO 2 emission reduction targets of the transport sector set in the Commission communication of 9 December 2020 entitled ‘Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy – putting European transport on track for the future’. One of the main barriers to wider deployment of zero-emission heavy-duty vehicles is the high upfront cost of acquiring such a vehicle. Securing a stronger business case for investing in zero-emission vehicles means working towards cost parity with conventional vehicles. The total cost of ownership consists of the upfront investment made to acquire the vehicle and the operational costs incurred during the vehicle’s lifetime. The gap in the total cost of ownership between conventional and zero-emission vehicles can be reduced by lowering the operational costs of zero-emission vehicles. Those costs include road charges.
(2)  Directive (EU) 2022/362 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) amended Directive 1999/62/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) by, among other changes, making it possible to set road charges according to vehicles’ CO 2 emissions. It introduced the possibility of varying infrastructure and user charges and/or internalising the external costs of CO 2 emissions. Both measures affect the operational costs of vehicles. The variation of charges decreases the operational costs of less-polluting vehicles, while external cost charges increase the operational costs of more-polluting vehicles. Both measures reduce the gap in the total cost of ownership between zero-emission and conventional vehicles. Both measures are important for strengthening the business case for investing in zero-emission vehicles.
(3)  Article 7ga(1), fifth subparagraph, of Directive 1999/62/EC currently gives Member States the possibility of applying reduced rates of infrastructure or user charges without putting any ceiling on such reductions, or of applying full exemptions from such charges, until 31 December 2025. Member States were required to transpose Directive (EU) 2022/362 into national law by 25 March 2024. That transposition deadline implies a very short implementation period of less than two years, which is too short to meaningfully incentivise the demand of new zero-emission heavy-duty vehicles. The implementation period should therefore be extended in order to create the right conditions for the wider deployment of zero-emission vehicles.
(4)  The variation of road charges affects investment decisions of transport operators acquiring a new vehicle. It therefore has an effect on the demand side of the market for new heavy-duty vehicles. Heavy-duty vehicle manufacturers constitute the supply side of the same market. They have a CO 2 emissions reduction target of 43 % by 2030, as set out in Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5) . While efficient conventional vehicles also contribute to the achievement of that target, the wider deployment of zero-emission vehicles is necessary in order to achieve it. The first year when manufacturers are to achieve that target is the reporting period 2030, with a deadline of 30 June 2031.
(5)  To ensure a clear and coherent legal framework and to support Union companies in the automotive sector in achieving their reduction targets for CO 2 emissions, the timing of the measures on the demand and supply side of the market of heavy-duty vehicles should be aligned. The date until which it is possible for Member States to apply significantly reduced rates of infrastructure or user charges or to exempt zero-emission vehicles from such charges should therefore be postponed to 30 June 2031.
(6)  The optional nature of the amended provision means that Member States are not obliged to transpose this Directive. They should nevertheless immediately inform the Commission if they use the option to grant zero-emission vehicles significantly reduced rates of infrastructure and user charges or exemptions to pay them after 31 December 2025,

Done at Strasbourg, 26 November 2025.",https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202502459,"The European Commission has proposed a directive aimed at extending the period during which zero-emission heavy-duty vehicles, such as trucks and buses, can benefit from reduced road charges or exemptions. This initiative is part of the EU's broader strategy to promote cleaner technologies and reduce reliance on fossil fuels, with the ultimate goal of achieving climate neutrality. The heavy-duty road transport sector, a significant contributor to CO2 emissions, faces challenges in reducing emissions due to its competitive market and low profit margins, which limit investment in zero-emission vehicles.

To address the high upfront costs associated with zero-emission vehicles, the proposal offers reduced infrastructure or user charges, thereby lowering the total cost of ownership and making these vehicles more attractive to operators. This approach is intended to accelerate the adoption of zero-emission vehicles, which is crucial for meeting future CO2 reduction targets. The directive builds on existing legislation that allows for differentiated road charges based on CO2 emissions, further incentivizing the shift towards cleaner vehicles by reducing operational costs.

Member States are permitted to apply higher external-cost charges for traffic-based CO2 emissions, potentially providing up to EUR 45,000 in monetary support in the first year of operation for zero-emission vehicles weighing up to 40 tonnes. This support varies for smaller vehicles and aims to achieve cost parity between zero-emission and conventional vehicles in some cases. The current exemption from reduced rates or charges is set to end on December 31, 2025, but the Commission proposes extending this until June 30"
