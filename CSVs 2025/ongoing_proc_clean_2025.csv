C ONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  This proposal provides for a date of application as of 1 January 2028 and is presented for a Union of 25 Member States. For Ireland and Denmark, the provisions of Protocols No 21 and No 22 annexed to the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) apply, as illustrated in the section on variable geometry on page 8.  · Reasons and objectives  Article 3 of TEU states that ‘ The Union shall offer its citizens an area of freedom, security and justice ’. Justice is closely linked to Union values, as enshrined in Article 2 TEU. These core values imply the need for independent judiciaries operating within efficient and high-quality justice systems capable of safeguarding fundamental rights and freedoms guaranteed by Union law, in particular by ensuring access to justice for suspects, accused persons, requested persons in European arrest warrant (EAW) proceedings and victims of crime. Judicial independence itself stems from the common constitutional traditions shared by all Member States, the rule of law mentioned in Article 2 TEU, the Member States’ obligation to provide remedies sufficient to ensure effective legal protection in the fields covered by Union law under Article 19 TEU, and from the fundamental right to an effective remedy before a tribunal, as enshrined in Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (‘the Charter’). In addition to being in line with Union values, a well-functioning Union area of justice with effective, efficient and resilient national justice systems is necessary for a flourishing internal market and is also a precondition for economic growth and competitiveness.  In the past years, the EU has combined several instruments to build a Union area of justice based on mutual trust . Several legislative and policy initiatives 1 have been adopted and supported, also thanks to dedicated EU funding.  Since its launch in 2014, the Justice programme has actively supported the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice, by fostering judicial cooperation based on mutual recognition and enforcement of judicial decisions. The Programme has also promoted Member States’ adherence to the rule of law and fundamental rights and supported the proper functioning of independent judicial systems. This has led to tangible progress across the EU as, for instance, national justice systems have become more effective, with legal practitioners now better informed and equipped to apply the relevant EU acquis , e.g. on the use of cross-border judicial cooperation procedures and mechanisms. At the same time, the practical protection and promotion of the rights of children and other vulnerable groups (such as persons with disabilities) involved in judicial proceedings continues to improve.  Significant progress has been made 2 , but achieving an effective, efficient, accessible, resilient and digitalised Union area of justice, based on the rule of law, remains an ongoing challenge. This calls for continued coordinated action by the EU and its Member States. In the Political Guidelines for the European Commission 2024-2029, President von der Leyen emphasised that the respect for the rule of law should remain ‘ a must for EU funds ’ 3 . This underscores the critical role EU funding plays in addressing persistent challenges.  In fact, despite the EU commitment, the protection and promotion of fundamental rights is an ongoing challenge 4 . These rights – such as the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial, as well as the protection of whistleblowers and their right to freedom of expression, associated procedural safeguards for suspects and accused persons as well as requested persons in EAW proceedings , and victims’ rights – are central to justice and the rule of law. Their effective implementation is essential to build trust in the justice system and ensure that everyone, including the most vulnerable, can effectively exercise their rights in the EU as an area of justice. However, as the 2021 annual report on the application of the Charter also show s , fragmented application of U nion law and legal protection gaps 5 reflect ongoing challenges in this area 6 .  In addition, progress on digitalisation across the EU is uneven. The EU’s growth and competitiveness increasingly rely on digitalisation, including in the justice sector. Digital tools and artificial intelligence (AI) can help public administrations, including courts, deliver faster, more accessible and cost-effective services. At the same time, the use of qualified trust services, such as electronic signatures and seals, brings benefits in terms of convenience and legal certainty in the context of cross-border transactions and is becoming increasingly relevant for transparent and trustable justice systems. The upcoming rollout of the EU Digital Identity framework and the forthcoming European Business Wallets are also expected to further facilitate digitalisation and build trust. Efficient and transparent justice systems enhance legal certainty, attract investment and strengthen cross-border cooperation in civil and criminal matters. Digitalisation reduces burdens on justice professionals, improves access to judicial files and allows citizens and businesses to engage with courts remotely. This increases transparency, saves costs and supports economic productivity. Moreover, digital justice systems are more resilient during crises, ensuring continuity and reinforcing public trust.  The rapidly changing economic, social and geopolitical environment creates uncertainties and challenges, including Russia’s full-scale war against Ukraine. Among the challenges which affect, more specifically, the Union area of justice, are the increasing threats to the rule of law, several forms of serious crime and obstacles to access to justice and judicial cooperation. Respect for the rule of law is a key determinant of a predictable business environment that drives investment and innovation, and an essential consideration for companies operating across borders. Respect for the rule of law ensures the proper functioning and resilience of the internal market, of the cooperation in the justice area based on mutual trust and recognition and is an essential precondition for compliance with the principles of sound financial management of the Union budget. Respect for the rule of law is necessary for the effective, uniform and transparent application of Union law and for equal access to justice. Facilitating cooperation in relation to forms of serious crime, such as corruption, terrorism and environmental crime is essential to maintain the rule of law and trust in those who govern public institutions.  Other challenges include persist ent obstacles to judicial cooperation and access to justice. Effective access to justice, including through digital means, is a prerequisite for economic growth . If there is no effective access to justice, both citizens and business development, especially that of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) , are affected . Weak justice systems, characteri s ed by inefficiency or high costs, deter business activities, thereby hindering economic growth 7 . One of t he main obstacles is the fact that communication in cross-border judicial proceedings is very often still paper-based, which leads to unnecessary delays and costs. One of the reasons is the different speed s of digitalisation of national justice systems and the absence of sufficient interoperability between Member States’ national IT systems , and similarly, between national systems and EU Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) agencies and bodies. Besides this aspect, delays and inefficiencies in cross-border judicial cooperation procedures remain evident. Access to justice – i.e. the ability of everyone to seek and obtain a just resolution of legal problems through a range of legal and justice services, in a manner that complies with fundamental rights, including access to reliable legal information and effective enjoyment of procedural safeguards – is still problematic, above all in cross-border contexts. This affects individuals, such as victims and persons suspected or accused of crime, and businesses. Moreover, the existing tools for collecting comparative information about the quality, independence and efficiency of Member States’ justice systems are still insufficient . All these factors can undermine Member States’ trust in each other ’ s justice systems and may therefore hinder the proper functioning of the EU area of freedom, security and justice.  Lastly , the level of knowledge, skills and awareness of the EU acquis and EU digital tools among practitioners in the justice field is often in sufficient. Despite the progress made 8 , the level of participation in training still differs considerably between Member States and among justice professions. This has a negative impact on the development of a common European judicial culture , since well-trained practitioners play a key role in ensuring that the EU acquis is implemented correctly and consistently across the EU. J ustice professionals also lack the necessary digitals skills and are not well equipped to use digital tools and infrastructure. Training on U nion law is also particularly important in view of the following factors: (i) the deterioration of the rule of law and attacks on fundamental rights in some Member States ; (ii) the need to prevent and combat forms of serious crime, including corruption ; (iii) the increasing relevance of digitalisation ; and (iv) the fact that there are more and more individuals exercising their right to live and work in another Member State 9 .  The consequences of not addressing these challenges will have serious repercussions, as most of these issues have a marked transnational dimension and cannot be adequately addressed by Member States acting alone. Building an effective Union area of justice has profound implications for the political, social and economic life of the EU. It also has tangible benefits for people’s day-to-day lives and business operations. The 2028-2034 Justice programme will support the further development of a Union area of justice based on the Union’s values, the rule of law, mutual recognition and trust, as well as effective, inclusive, accessible and resilient justice systems, which are a precondition for economic growth and competitiveness. The new Programme will also facilitate access to justice, promote judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters and promote judicial training with a stronger emphasis on the digitalisation of justice. The policy areas covered by this legal proposal are firmly anchored in the EU Treaties, which provide the legal bases for EU action through financial intervention. The Justice programme will continue to sustain open, democratic, pluralist and more equal and inclusive societies under the next Multiannual Financial Framework (2028-2034).  · Consistency with existing policy provisions  In recent years, the Justice programme has supported several legislative and policy initiatives and has directly contributed to delivering on several of the Commission’s priorities 10 . The priorities listed below are and will become even more relevant for the J ustice programme:  1. ‘ Protecting our democracy, upholding our values ’ . T he Justice programme will support judicial cooperation and access to justice by reinforcing the rule of law and fundamental rights as democratic foundation of the EU. The P rogramme’s new enhanced focus on digitalisation will make judicial systems more efficient , by enabling faster access to legal protection. This new focus directly complements efforts to safeguard democracy and fundamental rights, and increase legal certainty, investment protection, procedural fairness and public trust in democratic institutions. T he 2028-2034 Justice programme will support judicial independence and increase the capacity to enforce laws, including relevant rules to protect democracy . I t will enable cross-border judicial cooperation to combat cross-border digital crimes and support the implementation of digital tools that align with broader digital enforcement policies like the Digital Services Act 11 , the AI Act 12 and the European Accessibility Act 13 . It will contribute to the application of the Charter by supporting training of legal professionals on fundamental rights . To this end, synergies will be fostered in particular with the AgoraEU programme 14 .  2. ‘ Supporting people, strengthening our societies and our social model ’ . The Justice programme will contribute to uphold fundamental rights, for instance by promoting judicial training on non-discrimination and on the application of the Charter and create links with social cohesion policies by supporting consistent legal protection across Member States. The P rogramme will also support the implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights 15 by ensuring enforceability through more accessible justice mechanisms. Moreover, digitalised justice systems, set up with due attention to security vulnerabilities and the needs of all affected persons, have the potential to improve access to justice, including by reducing barriers , especially for children and other vulnerable groups such as people with disabilities, Roma and other marginalised communities . In this regard, synergies will be fostered with the Erasmus+ programme 16 and the National and Regional Partnership Plans 17 including, in particular in the framework of the European Social Fund 18 . By improving accessibility and affordability ( e.g. videoconferencing, e-filing), digital justice can better inform interested parties , serve the needs of many individuals and businesses , and reduce inequalities in accessing rights and services , by strengthening social and intergenerational fairness and making legal processes more efficient and inclusive.  3. ‘ Delivering together and preparing our Union for the future ’. The Justice programme will contribute to a more integrated and effective Union, including by creating and connecting digital infrastructure across Member States. Its increased focus on digitalisation will reduce administrative burdens for Member States, bring savings for citizens and businesses, improve cross-border cooperation and support mutual recognition and enforcement of judgments. At the same time, the Programme will support the goal of simplifying EU mechanisms by promoting more interoperability among national justice systems. In this regard, synergies will be fostered with the National and Regional Partnership Plans to ensure progress on the digitalisation of national justice systems at both national and EU level.  · Consistency with other Union policies  1. “ A New Plan for Europe’s Sustainable Prosperity and Competitiveness ” . The d igitalisation of justice contributes to growth and competitiveness by creating more efficient justice systems , with simplified legal procedures and reduced time and costs for cross-border litigation across the EU. This is particularly important for SMEs and start-ups. In this regard, s ynergies will be fostered with the National and Regional Partnership Plans in key areas such as skills , capacity-building and digitalisation. The Programme will complement also the plan to deepen the Single Market (especially in services and digital sectors and on financial services ) by promoting legal interoperability and smoother enforcement of EU rules. By financing activities on consumer and investors policy , company law and contract law and anti-money laundering , the 2028-2034 Single Market and Customs programme will complement the Justice programme and contribute directly to the implementation of EU policy in the field of justice and the creation of a U nion area of justice. Moreover, by reinforcing the rule of law and legal certainty, the Justice programme will strengthen the investment environment , reinforce the actions underpinning the Savings and Investments Union 19 and support the European Competitiveness Fund 20 by creating a stable legal framework for business activity. Lastly , there will also be synergies in the field of research and innovation, specifically concerning the need to deepen the understanding of the use of advanced new technologies, such as AI, in the justice sector and, therefore, synergies will be fostered with the next Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (Horizon Europe) 21 .  2. “ A New Era for European Defence and Security ”: The Justice programme facilitates cross-border judicial cooperation, which is crucial for security and to combat organised crime, terrorism, and cyber threats. The Programme also supports the enforcement of the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) and provides digital infrastructure for lawful access to electronic evidence and case management across borders. Moreover, the Justice programme supports anti-corruption measures at EU level . This complement s the call for reflection on extending the competence of the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) to handle serious cross-border crimes, especially corruption , that impacts Union funds and cannot be handled alone by Member States. In addition, the political guidelines for the European Commission 2024-2029 22 include the ambition to bolster Europol’s capacity to support national law enforcement agencies and its cooperation with other EU agencies and bodies . This ambition is closely aligned with the P rogramme’s increased focus on digitalisation, enabling faster transmission of evidence, real-time coordination and an enhanced use of secure AI/data analytics in legal enforcement within the limits of the applicable legal frameworks . It also aligns with the establishment of the Authority for Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AMLA) , which will help prevent the Union’s financial system from being used of money laundering and terrorist financing . Likewise, the reform of Eurojust will help EU-level coordination of cross-border investigations and prosecutions to become more effective, including thanks to new digital tools. Additionally, the digitalisation of justice will also provide technical resilience, secure infrastructure for legal systems , and frameworks for prosecuting cybercrime, thereby complementing the Preparedness Union 23 and cyber-defence strategies 24 as well as the ‘ ProtectEU – a European Internal Security Strategy ’ 25 . Given the intrinsic connections between security and justice on the ground, there will be synergies with EU funds covering asylum, migration and integration, border management and internal security, for instance to provide adequate training to the judiciary , also in relation to the new rules introduced by the Pact on Migration and Asylum, and ensure effective protection to victims of crime, interoperability with the European Criminal Records Information System (ECRIS) and inter-agency cooperation in the fields of justice and internal security, including via justice-related agencies and bodies such as Eurojust and the EPPO.  3. “ A Global Europe: Leveraging Our Power and Partnerships ”: The P rogramme’s focus on the rule of law, judicial cooperation and access to justice will mirror how they are promoted at global level, including through the implementation of the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 26 . In this respect, synergies will be developed with Global Europe 27 , as the Justice programme will contribute to the EU’s external action by strengthening judicial systems in accession countries in the context of the enlargement process .  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  · Legal basis  This proposal is based on Article 81(1) and (2) and Article 82(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).  Article 81(1) TFEU provides that the Union shall develop judicial cooperation in civil matters having cross-border implications.  Article 81(2) TFEU provides for the adoption of measures aimed at ensuring the mutual recognition and enforcement of judgments; the cross-border service of judicial and extrajudicial documents; effective access to justice and support for the training of the judiciary and judicial staff. Article 82(1) TFEU provides for measures to promote judicial cooperation in criminal matters.  The combination of these Articles allows for a comprehensive approach to support the development of judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters, especially cross-cutting issues affecting both fields.  · Variable geometry  This Regulation is based on legal bases under Title V of Part Three TFEU, concerning the area of freedom, security and justice. As a consequence, the application of the Regulation to Denmark and Ireland is subject to the provisions laid down in Protocol No 21 and Protocol No 22 annexed to the TEU and the TFEU.  In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No 22, Denmark does not take part in the adoption by the Council of measures proposed pursuant to Title V of Part Three TFEU, and such measures are not binding upon or applicable in Denmark.  In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No 21, Ireland does not take part in the adoption by the Council of measures proposed pursuant to Title V of Part Three TFEU, and such measures are not binding on or applicable in Ireland. However, Ireland may choose to take part in the adoption and application of any such proposed measure. In addition, any time after the adoption of such a measure, Ireland may accept the measure, subject to the completion of procedures referred to in Article 4 of Protocol No 21.  · Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  The objectives outlined under the section “reasons and objectives” have a strong transnational dimension and require joint solutions, as well as EU-level governance, coordination and support. Isolated national actions would be less effective and impactful than coordinated EU-level efforts, which foster cooperation, capacity building, mutual learning, and the sharing of resources, expertise and best practice.  Without EU action and funding, the functioning of a Union area of justice would be at risk, negatively affecting many beneficiaries, especially members of the judiciary, civil society organisations (CSOs) working on access to justice, and EU-wide legal networks. EU support helps overcome national barriers, enabling each Member State to act on issues it could not address alone. This ensures no Member State is left behind in tackling cross-border problems.  EU-level action is also key for addressing EU-wide priorities that may not rank highly on national agendas or where targeted support is needed. In some areas, national efforts alone may be insufficient, short-term or misaligned with EU priorities. For example, the EU should continue to support cross-border training on Union law and exchanges for judicial professionals. This is not only a Treaty-based obligation, but also essential for meeting shared transnational challenges, equipping justice professionals with the right skills and reinforcing core Union values.  The EU is uniquely positioned to create cross-border opportunities for justice professionals to connect, develop and contribute to a shared legal culture. It should therefore continue to promote transnational cooperation, awareness raising and networking. Such activities build mutual trust among national justice systems and help gather comparative data on their quality, independence and efficiency – something individual Member States cannot achieve alone.  EU action is equally crucial in areas needing close coordination with Member States to uphold international justice standards, such as the UN SDGs, and to maintain a unified EU stance on key issues like fundamental rights in the digital sphere and data protection.  Lastly, EU action is essential for advancing justice reforms in candidate countries as part of the enlargement process, particularly in the areas of the rule of law, independence of the judiciary and anti-corruption. These efforts are vital for safeguarding EU justice standards, completing the Single Market and strengthening EU cohesion and prosperity.  In addition to the need for EU action in this field, EU funds have also a strong added value because the EU is best placed to ensure that justice systems across the Union can operate in a harmonised manner. EU intervention has intrinsic added value for EU judicial training since delegating this responsibility at national level would lead to a more inconsistent understanding and implementation of Union law across Member States. This will have negative effects on the overall capacity of national actors to implement EU policies and laws, address cross-border issues and on the development of transnational multi-country projects. Moreover, EU action on justice policies helps boost the Single Market and improves competitiveness. A comprehensive and harmonised justice framework across Member States reduces legal uncertainties and inconsistencies, thereby facilitating smoother cross-border business operations and investments. Predictable enforcement of regulations, consistent protection of intellectual property rights, and effective dispute resolution mechanisms are crucial for maintaining investor confidence and encouraging entrepreneurship and innovation. By providing clear legal standards and ensuring their uniform application, the EU helps companies operate efficiently, reduces transaction costs and enhances the overall attractiveness of the Single Market. This legal predictability also bolsters fair competition by ensuring that businesses face equal conditions irrespective of their country of origin within the EU, thus promoting economic stability and sustainable growth.  · Proportionality  The proposal does not go beyond the minimum required in order to achieve the stated objective at Union level.  · Choice of the instrument  The new 2028-2034 Justice programme builds primarily on the 2021-2027 Justice programme. The most appropriate instrument to operationalise the proposed framework is a regulation.  3. RESULTS OF RETROSPECTIVE EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  · Retrospective evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  The mid-term evaluation of the 2021-2027 J ustice programme highlights that the actions funded by the Programme are coherent with policies and priorities at EU and national levels, aligned with other EU funding instruments and consistent with international commitments and objectives, such as the SDGs 28 . The streamlined architecture of the 2021-2027 P rogramme allows for greater impact and a more focused approach in key areas compared to the previous P rogramme 2014-2020 . Specifically, the 2021-2027 J ustice programme is successfully contributing to support ing the mutual recognition and enforcement of judicial decisions across Member States and to improving cross-border cooperation, by creating a long-term impact through the further development of a cohesive Union area of justice built on mutual trust and cooperation.  Direct funding to beneficiaries has led to immediate and tangible benefits for the target groups involved. In particular , funding for EU networks such as the European Judicial Training Network (EJTN) facilitates sustained collaboration, capacity building, and continuous high-quality engagement among legal professionals across the EU. Furthermore, the P rogramme’s continued emphasis on judicial training significantly contributes to unify and develop the EU legal landscape. The Justice programme plays a crucial role in fostering a shared legal culture by training thousands of judges, lawyers and court staff and by supporting the implementation of the 2021-2024 strategy on European judicial training 29 . By facilitating exchanges of best practice, the P rogramme strengthens Member States ’ collaboration, ensuring that judicial practitioners a pply U nion law in a uniform, coherent and consistent way across borders , thus enhancing the integrity of EU legislation.  The 2021-2027 P rogramme builds on the progress achieved in the previous programming period (2014-2020) , by further reducing barriers to justice and improving frameworks and protections for marginalised individuals 30 . At the same time, its mid-term evaluation points to some areas for improvement . First of all, evidence gathered through stakeholder consultations highlight s the need to expand the P rogramme’s reach . Even if it has already reached a large number of people, awareness of the P rogramme remains limited among certain types of stakeholders 31 and also varies between Member States. This suggests that while the P rogramme’s communication activities are effective, they may not be reaching all sectors and Member States equally 32 . Moreover, some stakeholders suggested includ ing correctional services and prison staff in the P rogramme’s target groups. In order to better reflect the P rogramme’s impact and enhance its added value and visibility, further actions could be considered , e.g. a more systemised process for collecting stakeholders’ perceptions and experiences , and ways to link the existing platforms (such as the EJTN and the e-Justice portal) with successful projects on the EU Funding & Tenders portal. In addition, t o keep increasing the P rogramme’s cost-effectiveness, collaboration with existing EU-level networks could be further explored.  All these findings are taken into account for the 2028-2034 Justice programme presented in this proposal.  I n terms of addressing new challenges, the digitalisation of justice has become a significant cross-cutting objective of the 2021-2027 Justice programme , particularly following the COVID-19 pandemic, which accelerated the use of digital technologies. This focus facilitates easier access to legal information, modernises cross-border judicial cooperation mechanisms and supports broader EU digital transformation goals, making justice systems more efficient and accessible. Investment in digitalisation also strengthens fundamental rights within the justice field, such as the presumption of innocence 33 . Moreover, the increased use of digital tools expands the P rogramme’s reach efficiently. There is still scope to further capitalise on opportunities brought about by digitalisation in the justice field. This is why the 2028-2034 Justice programme will have an increased focus on digitalisation under its general and specific objectives. This will ensure a more strategic and consistent approach to all the issues and challenges related to the digitalisation of justice .  · Stakeholder consultations  The consultation strategy supporting the preparatory work for the Programme included: (i) a first open public consultation (OPC) for the final evaluation of the 2014-2020 Justice programme 2024-2020 and the mid-term evaluation of the 2021-2027 Justice programme 2021-2027; (ii) a second OPC in the domains of cross-border education, youth, culture, media, values and civil society; and (iii) ad hoc consultations that the Commission organised in the form of interviews and targeted surveys with stakeholders.  The first OPC aimed to strengthen the evidence base for the evaluation of the two Justice programmes by gathering the views of relevant stakeholders on the Programmes’ effectiveness, efficiency, relevance, coherence and EU added value. It was launched on 3 April 2024 and was open for 12 weeks (closing on 26 June 2024).  Overall, respondents to this OPC considered the J ustice programme s ’ general and specific objectives to be highly relevant. Among the specific objectives, judicial training and access to justice were considered the most relevant . Moreover , most respondents considered the activities funded by the J ustice programmes to be relevant, in particular those related to developing and maintaining information and communication technology 34 , with digitalisation perceived as an important dimension of the P rogramme. Respondents considered both programmes effective in achieving their objectives and intended results , specifically concerning: (i) improving access for all citizens to CSO services, counselling activities and support activities (assessed as achieved to a very or high extent by 62% of respondents ); (ii) supporting training activities for stakeholders (assessed as achieved to a very high or high extent by 50% of respondents ); and (iii) increasing the cross - border interoperability of systems (assessed as achieved to a very or high extent by 50% of respondents ). In that regard, respondents highlighted the development of E-CODEX and ECRIS, as well as the training in the use of IT tools, as particularly relevant and effective. In terms of coherence, most respondents were not able to compare the J ustice programme with other programmes (only three out of eight respondents indicated that they were familiar with other similar EU initiatives and/or national initiatives in the field of justice). Two respondents considered the J ustice programmes to be complementary to other EU programmes or initiatives to a great extent, and one to a limited extent. There was consensus among respondents on the EU added value of both programmes, with all respondents considering that the EU was best placed to fund the type of activities under the J ustice programme , as EU involvement ensured that all Member States adhere d to the same standards, resulting in more equal access to justice. As a result, most respondents considered that, if the 2021-2027 Justice programme were to stop, Member States would not be able to achieve similar results at national, regional or local level and technical cooperation would become limited to smaller-scale bilateral projects between neighbouring Member States, while some organisations would not be able to secure funding at all. A summary report of the OPC is available on the European Commission’s “ Have your say platform ” 35 .  The second OPC , which inform ed the impact assessment for EU programmes in the domains of cross-border education, youth, culture, media, values and civil society under the 2028-2034 MFF , was carried out between 12 February and 7 May 2025 36 . The EU programmes covered by this OPC were: Creative Europe, Erasmus+, the European Solidarity Corps, the Citizens, Equality, Rights and Values programme and the Justice programme. The purpose of this OPC was to help assess the public perception of the relevance and EU added value of the EU programme s and to identify barriers to their specific impact and potential improvements to the P rogramme s’ architecture. The public consultation received 4 861 responses from 110 countries, encompassing all EU Member States as well as non-EU countries 37 . Most of these responses came from respondents with experience of Erasmus + and the European Solidarity Corps ; o nly 60 respondents declared to have experience with the Justice programme . 51% of responses were submitted by EU citizens. Within this group, around 1 200 respondents were under the age of 30. 49% of responses were submitted by organisations and institutions. These included 17% responses from academic and research bodies , t he majority of which were large institutions, with 69% employing more than 250 people. Another 1 1% of submissions came from non-governmental organisations (NGOs), several of which were umbrella CSO networks. Public authorities accounted for 232 submissions, including a mix of international, national, regional and local entities. A further 208 responses came from companies and businesses . A small number of additional responses (around 45) were received from trade unions, business associations, consumer groups and environmental organisations.  Some of the main results relevant for the justice field are detailed here below:  – According to the respondents, “ uphold and promote the rule of law ” is an important (22.51%) and very important (58.71%) policy priority and an area where EU funding provide added value to a large extent compared to funding at national, local or regional level (50.44%);  – According to the respondents, “ the effective protection of EU funds against fraud, corruption and other illegal activity ” is an important (25.78%) and very important (55.09%) policy priority and an area where EU funding provide added value to a large extent compared to funding at national, local or regional level (54.68%);  – According to the respondents, “ build an EU area of justice, promote judicial training, judicial cooperation and access to justice ” is an important (29.77%) and very important (37.03%) policy priority and an area where EU funding provide added value to a large extent compared to funding at national, local or regional level (47.85%);  – At the same time, the respondents consider that the following actions, which are particularly relevant under the Justice programme, bring to a large extent a positive impact in the future: “ Supporting cross-border mutual learning, exchange of good practices and cooperation, coalition building ” (72.19%), “ Supporting the creation and development of EU-level networks and organisations ” (60.48%), “ Capacity building and training/train-the-trainer activities ” (56.10%), “ Cross-border mutual learning possibilities in the justice area ” (49.08%).  · External expertise  The proposal has been informed by external and internal reports and assessments, e.g. programme evaluations (mid-term and ex post ), the spending review exercise, reports and documents from other EU institutions , agencies and international organisations 38 .  · Impact assessment  The impact assessment on cross-border education, youth, culture, media, values and civil society analysed the future of five funding programmes in this cluster, including the Justice programme.  The two options below were discarded at an early stage:  – A discontinuation of the EU funding : this option was immediately discarded given the importance of the problems affecting the policy areas in this cluster, the prominence given to these policies in the Political Guidelines for the European Commission 2024-2029 39 and the added value of the EU interventions, underpinned by the respective mid-term evaluations .  – Merging the Justice programme with other programmes in this cluster: this option was also discarded at an early stage for legal reasons. The Justice programme cannot be merged with other programmes in this cluster, as not all 27 EU Member States participate in the Justice programme (contrary to the other existing programmes in the cluster). The legal bases of the Regulation establishing the 2021-2027 Justice programme are Article 81(1) and (2) and Article 82 (1) TFEU. These provisions are part of Title V TFEU, which covers the area of freedom, security and justice. By virtue of the Protocols annexed to the Treaties, Denmark does not take part in decisions made under Title V in line with Protocol No 22 (known as ‘opt-out’) and Ireland can choose to take part in certain measures if it decides to ‘opt-in’, in line with Protocol No 21. The other programmes in the scope of the impact assessment are open to all Member States and are therefore incompatible with the legal bases of Title V.  Retained options : The Commission decided to have a stand-alone Justice programme, because both the final evaluation of the 2014-2020 Justice programme and the interim evaluation of the 2021-2027 Justice programme confirmed that the Programme provided unique added value that would be difficult to replicate at national level. This decision is reflected in the post-2027 MFF proposal package presented by the Commission on 16 July 2025.  In line with the Better Regulation Guidelines, the impact assessment report was submitted for quality scrutiny to the Regulatory Scrutiny Board (RSB). The RSB gave an opinion on the impact assessment on 13 June 2025. The RSB made a series of comments and recommendations on the following: scope, problem definition and the use of evaluations, intervention logic and objectives, comparison of options and cost-benefit analysis, governance, coherence, and future monitoring and evaluation. The impact assessment accompanying this legal proposal was reviewed in accordance with the RSB’s comments and recommendations .  · Simplification  The initiative will be in line with the Com m unication on the road to the 2028-2034 MFF 40 and its aim to streamline EU management, governance and implementation of EU programmes to improve efficiency for applicants, beneficiaries and EU institutions. Efforts will be made to simplify the application, management and reporting requirements and to provide additional guidance . Pooling of resources, including in areas such as monitoring and internal and external communication will bring economies of scale and enhance the predictability of EU funding more widely among beneficiaries, stakeholders and EU citizens.  As regards the management mode of the Programme, there is no clear scope for further simplification as the management modes used for the 2021-2027 Justice programme are appropriate for a programme of this size (i.e. direct management and a limited number of initiatives implemented under indirect management by the bodies referred to in point (c) of the first subparagraph of Article 62(1) of Regulation (EU) 2024/2509). During the last years, the Programme has implemented several simplification measures to streamline its processes and administrative procedures, thereby enhancing its efficiency. There is limited evidence to suggest that major changes are still needed, especially considering the simplification measures implemented thus far. For instance, to simplify implementation and reduce administrative burden for beneficiaries, the use of simplified forms of funding will remain the standard form of contribution for reimbursing grants.  Beneficiaries consider the instruments used for the 2021-2027 Justice programme (grants and procurement activities) suitable for the needs of the Programme.  At the same time, several findings show that the growing demand for the digitalisation of justice is highlighting significant investment gaps at both EU and national levels.  A two-level approach (i.e. at EU level and at Member-State level) is therefore necessary to allow the full digitalisation of national justice systems and to build an effective and interconnected Union area of justice.  This would not only create more links with all the policy areas covered under the Justice programme but will also provide for strong coherence with actions carried out at national level for the digitalisation of national justice systems under the National and Regional Partnership plans.  · Fundamental rights  The Programme objectives are closely linked to the promotion of fundamental rights and are in line with the Charter.  In the implementation of all of its actions, the Programme also seeks to promote the Union values set out in Article 2 TEU, gender equality, the rights of the child, including by means of child-friendly justice, the protection of victims’ rights and the effective application of the principle of equal rights and non-discrimination based on any of the grounds listed in Article 21 of the Charter, in accordance with and within the limits set by Article 51 of the Charter.  In addition, projects funded under the Programme must comply with the highest ethical standards , the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 41 and international law agreements to which the Union or all EU Member States are party (including the United Nations Convention on the rights of persons with disabilities 42 ) .  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  The financial envelope for the implementation of the Justice programme for the period 1 January 2028 to 31 December 2034 will be EUR 798 million (current prices).  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  · Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  This initiative will be monitored through the performance framework for the 2028-2034 budget established under Regulation (EU) XXX of the European Parliament and of the Council [Performance Regulation] 43 . The performance framework also sets out the rules for evaluations, which shall be conducted in accordance with the Commission's Better Regulation Guidelines and will be based on indicators relevant to the objectives of the Programme.  The Programme is implemented through direct management by the Commission. A limited number of initiatives might also be implemented under indirect management by international organisations.  · Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  The general objective of the proposed 2028-2034 Justice programme (Article 3 of the Regulation) is to contribute to the further development of an efficient, inclusive, resilient and digitalised Union area of justice, based on the rule of law, mutual recognition and mutual trust. By achieving this objective, the Programme will also strengthen democracy and the protection of fundamental rights and contribute to growth and competitiveness. This general objective will be achieved through three specific objectives:  (a) To facilitate and support judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters, and to promote the rule of law;  (b) To promote and support judicial training;  (c) To facilitate and support effective and non-discriminatory access to justice for all and effective remedy, including by digital means .  The Programme will provide for synergies between its different specific objectives to effectively support the policy areas these objectives cover and increase their potential to reach its target groups. To be effective, the Programme should take into account the specific nature of the different policies, their different target groups and their particular needs through tailor-made approaches.  In implementing this Regulation, the Commission will set the funding priorities in the respective policy areas each year. The structure of the Regulation allows for flexibility and for quick adjustments based on policy needs and new policy and technological developments.  2025/0255 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  establishing the Justice programme for the period 2028-2034 and repealing Regulation (EU) 2021/693  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 81(1) and (2) and Article 82(1) thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 44 ,  Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions 45 ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) Article 3 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) provides that the Union is to offer its citizens an area of freedom, security and justice and Article 67 of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) further specifies that the Union is to constitute an area of freedom, security and justice with respect for fundamental rights and the different legal systems and traditions of the Member States. Justice is closely linked to core values on which the Union is founded, particularly the rule of law , democracy and respect for fundamental rights as enshrined in Article 2 TEU. Those core values imply the necessity of independent judiciaries operating within efficient justice systems. Judicial independence itself stems from the common constitutional traditions shared by all Member States, the rule of law, and from the principle of effective judicial protection provided for in Article 19(1) TEU and Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the ‘Charter’).  (2) The completion of an area of freedom, security and justice is still challenged by factors such as threats to the rule of law, several forms of serious crime and obstacles to access to justice and judicial cooperation. It is therefore more important than ever to promote, strengthen, and defend justice, which has direct implications for the political , economic, financial and social life in the Union and beyond and is necessary to prepare for an enlarged Union . Building on the 2021-2027 Justice programme established by Regulation (EU) 2021/693 of the European Parliament and of the Council 46 , this Regulation aims at establishing the Justice p rogramme (the ‘Programme’) in order to support the further development of a Union area of justice based on the rule of law, fundamental rights, democracy, the independence and impartiality of the judiciary, mutual recognition and mutual trust, access to justice and cross-border judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters. The Programme should also provide an enhanced focus on digitalisation of justice across all its specific objectives.  (3) This Regulation lays down a n indicative financial envelope for the Justice programme . For the purpose of this Regulation, current prices are calculated by applying a fixed 2% deflator.  (4) In a rapidly changing economic, social and geopolitical environment, which creates uncertainties and challenges, recent experience has shown the need for a more flexible multiannual financial framework and Union spending programmes. To that effect, and in line with the objectives of the Justice programme, the funding should duly consider the evolving policy needs and Union’s priorities as identified in relevant documents published by the Commission, in Council conclusions and European Parliament resolutions, while ensuring sufficient predictability for the budget implementation.  (5) Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 of the European Parliament and of the Council 47 applies to the Programme. It lays down the rules on the establishment and the implementation of the general budget of the Union , including the rules on grants, prizes , non-financial donations, procurement, financial assistance, financial instruments and budgetary guarantees.  (6) In accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 , Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council 48 , Council Regulation ( EC Euratom) No 2988/95 49 , Council Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 50 and Council Regulation (EU) 2017/1939 51 , the financial interests of the Union are to be protected through proportionate measures, including the prevention, detection, correction and investigation of irregularities and fraud, the recovery of funds lost, wrongly paid or incorrectly used and, where appropriate, the imposition of administrative sanctions. In particular, in accordance with Regulation s (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 and (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 , the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) may carry out investigations, including on-the-spot checks and inspections, with a view to establishing whether there has been fraud, corruption or any other illegal activity affecting the financial interests of the Union. In accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017/1939, the European Public Prosecutor ’ s Office (EPPO) may investigate and prosecute fraud and other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Union as provided for in Directive (EU) 2017/1371 of the European Parliament and of the Council 52 . In accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 , any person or entity receiving Union funds is to fully cooperate in the protection of the Union’s financial interests, to grant the necessary rights and access to the Commission, OLAF, EPPO and the European Court of Auditors and to ensure that any third parties involved in the implementation of Union funds grant equivalent rights.  (7) The Programme is to be implemented in accordance with Regulation (EU) XXX of the European Parliament and of the Council [Performance Regulation] 53 which establishes the rules for the expenditure tracking and the performance framework for the budget, including rules for ensuring a uniform application of the principles of ‘do no significant harm’ and gender equality referred to in Article 33(2), points (d) and (f), of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 respectively, rules for monitoring and reporting on the performance of Union programmes and activities, rules for establishing a Union funding portal, rules for the evaluation of the programmes, as well as other horizontal provisions applicable to all Union programmes such as those on information, communication and visibility.  (8) Measures under the Programme should support enhanced mutual recognition and enforcement of judgments and judicial decisions in civil and criminal matters, mutual trust between Member States and the necessary approximation of legislation in order to facilitate cooperation between all the relevant authorities, including by digital means. The Programme should also support the maintenance and setting up of existing and new IT tools or platforms for new judicial cooperation instruments. While harvesting the efficiency gains of digitalisation of justice, the protection of fundamental rights, in accordance with the Charter, as well as safeguards against inequalities, discrimination and exclusion should be ensured.  (9) The Programme should, in all its activities, promote the rule of law also by supporting efforts to improve the independence, quality and efficiency of national justice systems in order to enhance mutual trust, which is indispensable for judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters.  (10) In civil matters, the Programme should support the protection of individual rights in civil and commercial cases, including Anti-SLAPP (strategic lawsuits against public participation), and promote greater convergence in civil law. This will help eliminate obstacles to satisfactory and efficiently functioning judicial and extrajudicial procedures for the benefit of all parties in a dispute. To support the effective enforcement and practical application of Union law in this area, the Programme should also support the functioning of the European Judicial Network in civil and commercial matters established by Council Decision 2001/470/EC 54 .  (11) In criminal matters, the Programme should help implement rules and procedures to ensure the recognition of judgments and decisions throughout the Union and support the protection of the Union financial interests. It should contribute to removing obstacles to effective mutual trust and cooperation, including through support for measures that ensure the correct transposition of Union legal acts approximating national criminal laws. The Programme should also support actions aimed at facilitating cooperation in relation to forms of serious crime such as corruption, terrorism and environmental crime . In particular, the Programme should enhanc e coordination and cooperation between law enforcement, judicial authorities and other competent authorities . Furthermore, it should support cooperation with and awareness raising of the role of Union bodies and agencies, such as the European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation ( Eurojust ) and the EPPO, thereby enabling a more integrated system of judicial cooperation in the Union.  (12) The Programme should contribute to improving non-discriminatory access to justice for all and should support activities to protect the rights of victims of crime as well as the procedural rights of suspects and accused persons in criminal proceedings as well as requested persons in European Arrest Warrant ( E AW ) proceedings. Access to justice should include, in particular, access to courts, alternative methods of dispute resolution, and legal advice to be provided in an independent and impartial manner by public office-holders . Particular attention should be given to improved implementation of the various Union legal acts for the protection of victims of crime, as well as to actions aimed at the exchange of best practices between competent authorities, including judicial authorities, law enforcement authorities, legal practitioners and at supporting the improvement of the knowledge and use of collective redress instruments. Moreover, support should be given to activities which facilitate effective and equal access to justice for persons who face discrimination or are in a situation of vulnerability (such as persons with disabilities in accordance with Article 13 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 55 , children, minorities, LGBTIQ + persons and victims of gender-based violence, domestic violence and other forms of interpersonal violence. The Programme should also support activities of civil society organisations which contribute to those objectives.  (13) T he Programme should support the training of the judiciary and judicial staff. T raining activities should contribute to the implementation of Union strategic priorities, including for instance, training on civil and criminal law, on the effective application of the Charter, on mutual recognition as well as on procedural safeguards (including safeguards for strategic lawsuits against public participation (a nti-SLAPP) ) . Training activities under the Programme should have a strong focus on digitalisation of justice, providing a supportive environment for the judiciary and judicial staff , including through increas ing digital skills, knowledge and awareness . Training should also support the digitalisation of cross-border judicial proceedings. S upport to training should happen in synergy with measures at national level, thus leveraging the impact of the P rogramme .  (14) The Programme should support the annual work programme of the European Judicial Training Network (EJTN), which is an essential actor with regard to judicial training and plays an important role in supporting and implementing the objectives of European judicial training policy. The EJTN is the only network at Union level bringing together the judicial training bodies of the Member States . It is therefore in a unique position to organise exchanges and training for the judiciary between Member States and to coordinate the work of national judicial training bodies , thereby fostering synergies between U nion supported and nationally funded training and structured communication between the U nion and national training providers. Moreover, the EJTN may also include the judicial training bodies of candidate countries and potential candidates as observer members.  (15) The protection of children’s rights is a core objective of the Union, as enshrined in Article 3(3) of the TE U and Article 24 of the Charter. In all actions concerning children, the best interests of the child are to be a primary consideration. Th at is essential also for the legitimacy and effectiveness of justice systems. Children involved in legal proceedings , whether as witnesses, victims, suspects, accused or convicted persons, or other parties , often face significant barriers which undermine their ability to participate effectively and to benefit from appropriate safeguards. Strengthening the capacity of national justice systems and practitioners to address the specific needs of children is therefore necessary to ensure the effective exercise of their rights.  (16) The Programme should contribute to digitalisation of justice , including by developing, rolling-out and maintaining tools at Union level. It could thus leverag e tools facilitating digital communication between courts and parties such as the European Elect r onic Access Point, allowing easier access to judicial data such as the European Case Law I dentifier , or enhancing the efficiency and security of digitalised judicial procedures such as trust services under Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 and the European Digital Identity Wallets . A well-functioning Union area of justice with effective and resilient national justice systems is necessary for a flourishing internal market and it is a precondition for economic growth , sound financial markets and competitiveness. Digitalisation enhances the efficiency of cross-border judicial procedures in civil and criminal matters as well as access to justice within the Union, which in turn are a driver for investments. Digitalisation of justice also enables and facilitates the effective and efficient cooperation with other competent authorities in the implementation and enforcement of key pieces of the EU digital rulebook, such as for instance the Digital Services Act. Digitalising justice systems helps also to reduce costs for both public budgets and end users, while maintaining effective services for citizens and businesses. It enables justice professionals to focus on core tasks, improving the quality and efficiency of proceedings. Digital tools also expand access to justice, by allowing remote communication and easy access to judicial files, thereby enhancing transparency. Moreover, digitalisation strengthens the resilience of national justice systems in times of crisis (such as pandemics), ensuring they can continue to operate effectively for the benefit of citizens and businesses . That strengthens trust in the justice system’s ability to function reliably under unexpected circumstances.  (17) The Union must protect its security interest against suppliers which could represent a persistent security risk due to the potential interference from third countries as well as their security, notably cybersecurity . It is therefore necessary to reduce the risk of persisting dependency on high-risk suppliers in the internal market, including in the ICT supply chain, as they could have potentially serious negative impacts on security for users and companies across the Union and the Union’s critical infrastructure in terms of the integrity of data and services as well as the availability of service. This restriction should be based on a proportionate risk assessment and associated mitigation measures as defined in the Union policies and laws.  (18) The Commission should ensure overall consistency, complementarity and synergies with the work of Union bodies, offices and agencies, in particular Eurojust, the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA), the European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (eu-LISA) and the EPPO, and should take into account the work of other national and international actors in the areas covered by the Programme.  (19) In order to ensure the efficient allocation of funds from the general budget of the Union, it is necessary to ensure that all actions carried out under the Programme have Union added value, complement Member States’ actions and are consistent with other Union actions. Consistency, complementarity and synergies should be sought in particular with funding programmes supporting policy areas that are closely interlinked, such as the National and Regional Partnership Plans (established by Regulation XXX of the European Parliament and of the Council [NRP Regulation] 56 ) , the AgoraEU programme ( established by Regulation XXX of the European Parliament and of the Council [AgoraEU] 57 , ), and external actions supported by Global Europe ( established by Regulation XXX of the European Parliament and of the Council 58 ) .  (20) The Programme replaces the programme established by Regulation (EU) 2021/693 for the programming period 2021-2027 which should therefore be repealed.  (21) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No 22 on the position of Denmark, annexed to the TEU and to the TFEU, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application.  (22) In accordance with Article 3 of Protocol No 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, annexed to the TEU and the TFEU, Ireland has notified [, by letter of … ,] its wish to take part in the adoption and application of this Regulation.  or  In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, annexed to the TEU and to the TFEU, and without prejudice to Article 4 of that Protocol, Ireland is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application,  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Article 1  Subject matter  This Regulation establishes the Justice programme (the ‘Programme’) and lays down the objectives of the Programme, its budget for the period 2028-2034, the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding.  Article 2  Definition  For the purposes of this Regulation, ‘judiciary and judicial staff’ means judges, prosecutors and members of staff of courts and of prosecutors’ offices, as well as any other justice professionals associated with the justice systems or otherwise participating in the administration of justice, irrespective of the definition in national law, legal status or internal organisation, such as lawyers, notaries, bailiffs or enforcement officers, insolvency practitioners, mediators, court interpreters and translators, court experts, prison staff and probation officers.  Article 3  Programme objectives  1. The general objective of the Programme is to contribut e to the further development of an efficient, inclusive, resilient and digitalised Union area of justice, based on the rule of law, mutual recognition and mutual trust, thereby also strengthening democracy and the protection of fundamental rights, and contributing to the Union’s growth and competitivenes s , as well as the digitalisation of justice at the U nion l evel.  2. T he Programme has the following specific objectives:  (a) t o facilitate and support judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters, and to promote the rule of law, in particular the independence, quality and efficiency of justice systems, including through improving the effective cross-border recognition and enforcement of judicial decisions;  (b) to promote and support training of the judiciary and judicial staff , with a view to : promoting the rule of law, fundamental rights and democracy; fostering a common legal and judicial culture; ensuring the consistent and effective implementation of the relevant Union legal instruments ; and providing a supportive environment for the digitalisation of judicial cooperation and justice systems .  (c) to facilitate and support effective and non-discriminatory access to justice for all and effective remedy, including by digital means, by promoting efficient civil and criminal procedures and by promoting and supporting the rights of all victims of crime and the procedural rights of suspects and accused persons in criminal proceedings as well as of requested persons in E uropean A rrest W arrant proceedings.  Article 4  Budget  1. The indicative financial envelope for the implementation of the Programme for the period from 1 January 202 8 to 31 December 20 34 is set at EUR 798 000 000 in current prices .  2. Appropriations may be entered in the Union budget beyond 2034 to cover the expenses necessary and to enable the management of actions not completed by the end of the Programme .  3. The financial envelope referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article and the amounts of additional resources referred to in Article 5 may also be used for technical and administrative assistance for the implementation of the Programme, such as preparatory, monitoring, control, audit and evaluation activities , corporate information technology systems and platforms, information and communication activities, including corporate communication on the political priorities of the Union, and all other technical and administrative assistance or staff-related expenses incurred by the Commission for the management of the P rogramme.  Article 5  Additional resources  1. Member States, Union institutions, bodies and agencies, third countries, international organisations, international financial institutions, or other third parties, may make additional financial or non-financial contributions to the P rogramme . Additional financial contributions shall constitute external assigned revenue within the meaning of Article 21(2), points (a), (d), or (e) or Article 21(5) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509.  2. Resources allocated to Member States under shared management may, at their request, be made available to the Programme . The Commission shall implement those resources directly or indirectly in accordance with Article 62(1 ) , point (a) or (c ) , of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509. They shall be additional to the amount referred to in Article 4(1) of this Regulation . Those resources shall be used for the benefit of the Member State concerned. Where the Commission has not entered into a legal commitment under direct or indirect management for additional amounts thus made available to the Programme , the corresponding uncommitted amounts may, at the request of the Member State concerned, be transferred back to one or more respective source programmes or their successors.  Article 6  Alternative, combined and cumulative funding  1. The Programme shall be implemented in synergy with other Union programmes. An action that has received a Union contribution from another programme may also receive a contribution under the Programme . The rules of the relevant Union programme shall apply to the corresponding contribution or a single set of rules may be applied to all contributions and a single legal commitment may be concluded . If the Union contribution is based on eligible costs, the cumulative support from the Union budget shall not exceed the total eligible costs of the action and may be calculated on a pro-rata basis in accordance with the documents setting out the conditions for support.  2. Award procedures under the Programme may be jointly conducted under direct or indirect management with Member States, Union institutions, bodies and agencies, third countries, international organisations, international financial institutions, or other third parties ( ‘partners to the joint award procedure’) , provided the protection of the financial interests of the Union is ensured. Such procedures shall be subject to a single set of rules and lead to the conclusion of single legal commitments. For that purpose, the partners to the joint award procedure may make resources available to the Programme in accordance with Article 5 of this Regulation, or the partners may be entrusted with the implementation of the award procedure, where applicable in accordance with Article 62(1), point (c), of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024 /2509. For the purposes of Article 153(3) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509, in joint award procedures the evaluation committee may be partially composed by members that are representatives of the partners in that procedure.

The proposal/initiative relates to:   a new action   a new action following a pilot project / preparatory action 60   the extension of an existing action   a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action  1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative  1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative  Whereas legislation is a key tool to implement the Union’s objectives in the area of justice, it needs to be complemented by other means. In this context, funding has an important role to play to enhance the effectiveness of legislation by increasing knowledge, awareness and capacity of justice professionals and other key stakeholders, through supporting, for instance:  - dissemination of information and awareness raising, including support for national and European campaigns to inform people of their rights and forums for discussion for stakeholders to enhance the knowledge of the Programme and the transferability of its results;  - training, exchanges and capacity building for the judiciary and judicial staff and other practitioners and relevant national authorities, to equip them with the tools to effectively put Union rights and policies into practice.  Funding has also a central role in promoting cooperation at transnational level and developing mutual trust, through, for instance:  - developing and strengthening the capacity of key European-level networks, European-level judicial associations and European level judicial training providers to assist with the preparation of future initiatives in the areas covered by the Programme, as well as to promote their consistent implementation across Europe;  - cross-border cooperation on enforcement and coordination of other national actions to maximise and deepen the impact of Union level actions;  - cross-border interoperability of systems and applications by deploying and maintaining innovative techniques and technologies, notably digital ones.  Additionally, funding should also support, for instance:  - Research, studies, surveys, evaluations, impact assessments, analytical, monitoring and other support activities which allow to be always updated on new improvements and challenges on the ground. The results of these activities will then feed into the development and implementation of Union policies and ensure that they are evidence-based, well targeted and well structured.  The Programme will contribute to tackling common transnational challenges by taking into account the specific nature and challenges of the different policy areas, their different target groups and their particular needs. By bringing together support in these areas, the Union will be better equipped to address recurrent but also new and emerging policy priorities.  The Programme will publish every year around four calls for proposals (including operating grant calls) and support some indirect management activities with international organisations. Some calls will be biennial. In addition to this, the Programme will undertake some actions through contracts following public procurement. The types of activities funded may include, for example: conferences, expert meetings, meetings of committees in support of implementing EU legislative acts, seminars, communication, information and visibility activities; development of training material and development and maintenance of IT platforms and systems; surveys, studies and impact assessments.  All these activities will be implemented over the whole period 2028-2034. It is difficult to set a precise roll-out at this stage, as the Programme has been conceived to remain flexible enough to adapt to new emerging priorities and needs.  1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, greater effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this section ’ added value of EU involvement ’ is the value resulting from EU action, that is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.  Reasons for action at EU level ( ex ante )  Despite progress, the EU continues to face major cross-border justice challenges requiring coordinated action. The Justice programme remains highly relevant and impactful, helping Member States uphold EU values and fundamental rights. Without EU-level support, national responses would be fragmented, inefficient and uneven, especially in areas like judicial training, access to justice, and digitalisation. EU funding enables joint solutions, legal cooperation, and interoperability of justice systems, particularly benefiting smaller Member States. It also helps fill national gaps, sustain EU-wide legal networks and build a common European legal culture. The Justice programme is vital for supporting CSOs working in the field of access to justice and transnational projects that could not be realised otherwise. EU action ensures uniform standards, promotes fair access to justice, strengthens the Single Market and boosts competitiveness by reducing legal uncertainty. It also key to support the EU enlargement process and to ensure coherence between internal and external justice policies, thereby reinforcing the EU’s role globally and safeguarding its legal order.  Expected generated EU added value ( ex post )  Collaboration and networking between stakeholders will lead to the dissemination of best practices, in particular innovative and integrated approaches in different Member States. The participants in the activities funded by the Programme will then act as multipliers in their respective professional activities within their Member State. European Union intervention allows for these activities to be pursued consistently across the Union and brings economies of scale.  1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past  The mid-term evaluation of the 2021-2027 Justice programme showed that the Programme continues to effectively strengthen cross-border judicial cooperation and mutual trust among Member States as well as judicial training and access to justice for vulnerable groups. The Pprogramme is also increasingly promoting digitalisation, thereby improving access to legal information and modernising judicial cooperation tools. The evaluation confirmed the overall effectiveness of the Programme and the validity of its targeted objectives, but some aspects have been identified for improvement, in particular: the limited budget constrains the Programme’s ability to meet growing digital needs; awareness remains uneven, with CSOs less informed than public authorities and the Programme is less known in some countries. Additionally, some beneficiaries continue to experience challenges with the application procedure and reporting requirements.  1.5.4. Compatibility with the multiannual financial framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments  The initiative is part of the 2028-2034 Multiannual Financial Framework proposal.  The Programme will seek synergies, consistency and complementarities with other Union instruments supporting policy areas which are closely interlinked, such as with the AgoraEU programme and the  programmes in the areas of asylum, migration and integration, border management and internal security, consumers, employment, education, social inclusion, research and innovation. Cooperation will be sought as well as with external actions supported by Global Europe and with the National and Regional Partnership Plans for what concerns judicial reforms and digitalisation of national justice systems. Duplication with activities under these other programmes will be avoided.  1.5.5. Assessment of the different available financing options, including scope for redeployment  N/A.  1.6.

Comments  The Programme will be implemented under direct management as well as under indirect management through international organisations (e.g. CoE, UNESCO, OECD…)  2. MANAGEMENT MEASURES  2.1. Monitoring and reporting rules  This initiative will be monitored through the performance framework for the 2028-2034 budget established under Regulation (EU) XXX of the European Parliament and of the Council [Performance Regulation]. The performance framework also sets out the rules for evaluations, which shall be conducted in accordance with the Commission's Better Regulation Guidelines and will be based on indicators relevant to the objectives of the Programme.  2.2. Management and control system(s)  2.2.1. Justification of the budget implementation method(s), the funding implementation mechanism(s), the payment modalities and the control strategy proposed  The Justice programme will be managed directly by the Commission as this allows to better adapt the Programme to the needs of the different policies, have more flexibility to re-adjust priorities in case of emerging needs and establish direct contacts with beneficiaries/contractors and stakeholders directly engaged in activities that serve relevant Union policies. The implementation mode of the 2021-2027 Programme (direct and indirect management) has so far proved effective and suitable for the needs of the Programme and its beneficiaries. The use of simplified forms of funding will remain the standard form of contribution for reimbursing grants.  2.2.2. Information concerning the risks identified and the internal control system(s) set up to mitigate them  The Programme faces the same risks as other Commission programmes that target beneficiaries which are diverse in nature. In particular, some beneficiaries are not recurring or do not have extensive administrative structures. Risks are mainly related to (1) ensuring quality of selected projects and their subsequent technical implementation; (2) risk of inefficient or non-economic use of funds awarded, both for grants and procurement; (3) fraud.  Most of these risks are expected to be reduced thanks to: (1) careful design of calls for proposals; (2) guidance to applicants and beneficiaries; (3) the use of the simplified cost options of unit costs, flat rates and lump sums, which have been effectively applied in the 2021-2027 MFF and are provided in the Regulation (EU) 2024/2509); (4) the use of corporate procedures and systems for the management of proposals and grants (e.g. grants vademecum, eGrants etc.) to ensure a full alignment with best practice in all stages of the grant and procurement lifecycles; (5) the measures laid down in the anti-fraud strategy.  The control system envisaged for the 2028-2034 Programme will be a continuation of the 2021-2027 control system. The control strategy is composed of different building blocks: (1) programming, evaluation and selection of proposals to ensure that only best proposals are funded; (2) signing and monitoring of grant agreements, subject to ex ante verification at both financial and policy level; (3) ex post audits based on a ‘detection strategy’ aimed at identifying a maximum of anomalies in view of recovering undue payments.  2.2.3. Estimation and justification of the cost-effectiveness of the controls (ratio between the control costs and the value of the related funds managed), and assessment of the expected levels of risk of error (at payment & at closure)  The cost of controls of the Programme amounts to approximately 3.2% of the payments done by the Commission. This is expected to stay stable or slightly decrease if the use of simplified cost options is further expanded. The objective for the management and control system is to maintain the expected levels of risk of error (at payment and at closure) below the materiality threshold of 2%.  2.3. Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities  DG JUST will continue to apply its Anti-Fraud Strategy (updated in June 2024) in line with the Commission’s Anti-Fraud Strategy (CAFS) in order to ensure, inter alia, that its internal anti-fraud related controls are fully aligned with the CAFS and that its fraud risk management approach is geared to identify fraud risk cases and adequate responses.  The Anti-fraud strategy enables fraud risk to be addressed, mainly via measures to prevent irregularity which are then escalated in the event of fraud detection. The following measures will continue to be implemented: desk monitoring, monitoring missions in accordance with a defined monitoring strategy, clear reporting requirements in the grant agreements with beneficiaries, kick-off meetings with new beneficiaries, possibility to cut grants upon non-delivery of results or non-compliance with certain funding conditions such as those linked to information, communication and visibility.  Beneficiaries in exclusion cases are submitted to the Early Detection and Exclusion Database (EDES) and cases are followed up with OLAF and the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO).  3.

The estimation of the operational staff working on the Programme is based on a distribution corresponding to the share of Justice budget against the total programme budget managed by the DG, which also includes the CERV programme and the consumer strand of the Single Market Programme.  The estimation of staff from policy units is based on the high number of policies and pieces of legislation supported by the Justice programme implementation, hence on policy units involvement at key stages of the process, such as preparation of the calls for proposals, project selection and implementation.  Operational, policy and coordination staff combined amount to 60 FTE, including 5 CA funded from outside Heading 4 (former BA lines), which is considered necessary to effectively cater for the expanded more labour intensive portfolio – including, in particular, initiatives such as the digitalisation of justice, increased number of financial operations for the implementation of the Programme, and in line with the thematic scope of the Programme as per political guidelines.  Starting from the current staffing level as baseline, and considering the 2.7 fold increase in the envelope of the Justice programme in the next MFF, the FTEs requested is necessary to enable DG JUST to cope with the actions required to reach the political objectives of the Von der Leyen II Commission with the 2028-2034 Justice programme being instrumental in successfully delivering on the Commission’s ambitions.  There is no margin in the current teams to further redeploy staff between functions without putting at risk the credibility of the Commission to deliver in the areas of DG JUST’s competence.

Alignment with the European Data Strategy The provisions under the proposal support interoperability, reusability, and secure data sharing, in line with the European Data Strategy. Where personal data are processed ( e.g. participants), it aligns with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 65 . The architecture is also consistent with the Open Data Directive 66 , as relevant aggregated, non-personal data may be made available for reuse by researchers or public bodies. Alignment with EU Digital Identity Framework The proposal aligns with the EU Digital Identity Framework, which enables secure identification and the use of electronic attestations of attributes to verify specific characteristics or qualifications of individuals, economic operators and organisations, including in the context of justice and legal proceedings. Furthermore, the proposal will be compatible with the forthcoming European Business Wallets, which will further enable the sharing of attestations in professional contexts, such as in cross-border legal proceedings, allowing legal professionals and businesses to securely and efficiently share verified information with courts, public administrations, and other partners, thereby reducing administrative burdens and increasing trust in digital justice systems. Alignment with the once-only principle Dashboards established are the source of traceability and reusability of the data available from the Programme implementation. Data comes from the project lifecycle tools/documents (e.g. application forms, final reports, participant surveys). Traceability and reusability of the data available from the Programme implementation will be ensured. The data will be recorded via the project lifecycle documents and made accessible, in line with the provisions of the Regulation (EU) XXX of the European Parliament and of the Council [Performance Regulation] regarding transparency of information on programmes performance and achievements through the Single Gateway portal.

General comment : The exchange of data between the Member States is of key importance for the success of the various initiatives in the field of digitalisation of justice. A number of initiatives are dependent on data and its availability. A good example is the EU Strategy for the digitalisation of justice, planned to be adopted by the end of 2025. Another example for the exchange of data is the European Legal Data Space 67 , which aims to ensure the availability of judicial data, including for the purposes of training AI.

Some examples of IT systems, which will be funded by the continuation of the Justice p rogramme, are the European e-Justice Portal, which is a one stop-shop for all justice matters, and the decentralised IT system developed under Regulation (EU) 2023/2844 72 for the digitalisation of cross-border judicial cooperation. The Justice p rogramme is used to fund IT systems at EU level stemming from legal instruments or from the voluntary cooperation of Member States. In both cases, these are systems with high political and operational importance for Member States, which support the smooth day-to-day functioning of the justice sector by enhancing efficiency and ensuring interoperability.; Digital solution; Reference(s) to the requirement(s); Main mandated functionalities; Responsible body; How is accessibility catered for?; How is reusability considered?; Use of AI technologies (if applicable); Digital solution #1 – Direct Grant Management platform; Article 4; Direct Grant Management; European Commission; In accordance with Commission Standard; //; The platform shall leverage the use artificial intelligence where relevant and adhering with the precautionary principle.; Digital solution #2 – Platform(s) to support the Programme; Article 3, par. 1 and par. 2 (b) and (c) and Article 4; Disseminate Programme’s results; European Commission; In accordance with Commission Standard; //; The platform(s) shall leverage the use artificial intelligence where relevant and adhering with the precautionary principle.; Digital and/or sectorial policy (when these are applicable); Explanation on how it aligns; AI Act 68; When leveraging AI, the European Commission will ensure the compliance with the AI Act.; EU Cybersecurity framework 69; Without prejudice to Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the European Commission shall ensure the security, integrity, authenticity and confidentiality of the data collected and stored for the purpose of this regulation; EU Digital Identity Framework, European Business Wallets; In accordance with the EU Digital Identity Framework, the Commission shall ensure that the grant management platform is interoperable with the EU Digital Identity Wallets and the forthcoming European Business Wallets to enable identification, authentication, the exchange of electronic attestations of attributes and the use of trust services.”; ; ; Single Digital Gateway 70 and IMI 71; NA; Others; NA; Digital and/or sectorial policy (when these are applicable); Explanation on how it aligns; AI Act; When leveraging AI, the European Commission will ensure the compliance with the AI Act.; EU Cybersecurity framework; Without prejudice to Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the European Commission shall ensure the security, integrity, authenticity and confidentiality of the data collected and stored for the purpose of this regulation; EU Digital Identity Framework, European Business Wallets; In accordance with the EU Digital Identity Framework, the Commission shall ensure that these platforms are interoperable with the EU Digital Identity Wallets and the forthcoming European Business Wallets to enable identification, authentication, the exchange of electronic attestations of attributes and the use of trust services.”; ; ; Single Digital Gateway and IMI; NA; Others; NA Row 2 — Digital solution; Reference(s) to the requirement(s); Main mandated functionalities; Responsible body; How is accessibility catered for?; How is reusability considered?; Use of AI technologies (if applicable) Row 3 — Digital solution #1 – Direct Grant Management platform; Article 4; Direct Grant Management; European Commission; In accordance with Commission Standard; //; The platform shall leverage the use artificial intelligence where relevant and adhering with the precautionary principle.

These include the European judicial training strategy , the EU strategy on victims’ rights , the Council’s European e-justice strategy , the EU strategy on the rights of the child , and the forthcoming Commission strategy on digitalisation of justice that aims to promote digital transformation within justice systems. Moreover, to further uphold the rule of law, the European Commission established the rule of law mechanism , including the annual rule of law report , which evaluates developments in judicial independence, anti-corruption frameworks and access to justice in Member States. The Commission’s anti-corruption package , adopted in 2023, introduced comprehensive measures to combat corruption, enhance transparency and safeguard judicial integrity throughout the Union. The EU has also adopted an internal security strategy and a counter-terrorism agenda .  For instance, insights from the EU Justice Scoreboard 2024 and data collected via recent Eurobarometer surveys highlighted progress in Member States’ efforts to deliver effective national justice systems, but these insights also suggest that there is a continued need for improvement. Possible improvements include: (i) the need to reduce the burden of court fees; (ii) the availability of legal aid; (iii) the promotion of voluntary use of alternative dispute resolution methods (ADRs); (iv) support for the participation of persons with disabilities as professionals in the justice system; and (v) facilitating access to justice by electronic means, because the uptake of digitalisation in national justice systems across EU Member States remains uneven. In addition, cross-border crimes have continued to rise since 2020, suggesting cross-border judicial cooperation will only become more important.

The initiative addresses challenges such as gaps in legal protection and uneven progress in digitalization, emphasizing judicial independence and universal access to justice. A significant aspect of the proposal is the use of EU funding to bolster national justice systems and improve the capabilities of legal practitioners.

The programme highlights the importance of digital tools and artificial intelligence in modernizing justice systems, making them more accessible, transparent, and efficient. This modernization is expected to enhance legal certainty and cross-border cooperation, with digital systems providing resilience during crises and reinforcing public trust. Feedback from stakeholders, including EU citizens and organizations, informed the proposal, focusing on upholding the rule of law and protecting children's rights.

To address transnational challenges, the programme considers the specific needs of different policy areas and target groups. It will publish annual calls for proposals, supporting activities like conferences, expert meetings, and training material development. Designed to be flexible, the programme will adapt to emerging priorities over its duration. A critical aspect of the proposal is the management and control system, which aims to maintain the expected levels of risk of error below the materiality threshold of 2%. To prevent fraud and irregularities, the European Commission's Directorate-General for Justice will continue to oversee the programme.

CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons and objectives  The Commission Political Guidelines 2024-2029 emphasise that migration is a European challenge that must be met with a European solution. Europe’s geopolitical context has significantly changed, profoundly affecting the Union’s migration and asylum management, which has been further impacted by the weaponisation of migration. Member States need to be able to rapidly and effectively respond to developments of migratory flows and receive Union support for that purpose.  With the adoption of the Pact on Migration and Asylum (the ‘Pact’) the Union has made a significant progress toward a comprehensive approach to asylum, migration and border management, including its external dimension. The Pact sets up a system governed by the principle of solidarity and the fair sharing of responsibility, including its financial implications, between the Member States. The success of the new system created by the Pact relies on the readiness of all Member States – with the actions of one having implications for all. The Pact implementation has to be manageable for everyone and be managed together.  The Pact requires Member States to develop National Implementation Plans based on the Common Implementation Plan of the Commission. It is clear from those plans that significant financial resources will be needed in the years ahead. Member States need to make the necessary reforms to ensure national systems are efficient and fit-for-purpose in line with the Pact obligations and that the European system created by the Pact functions as it should.  This also implies providing adequate EU funds to support its implementation. In addition to the immediate needs that will be funded under the current Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027, Member States will need to continue investing and improving their systems. For example, every three years the Commission will reassess the ‘adequate capacity’ obligations of Member States for the implementation of the border procedure. This reassessment may require that Member States make further investments to fulfil their obligations.  Furthermore, the need to develop national integrated case management systems bringing together asylum, reception, and return has been identified by the Commission as a key priority in almost all Member States. The significant changes required in many Member States to build these integrated systems and embrace the digitalisation agenda will require significant investments in the medium-to-long term. This digitalisation, including the evolution of the artificial intelligence-based (AI) technology, is also a key component for simplifying and increasing the efficiency of the system which could eventually lead to the creation of European case-management systems.  While it should be supported mostly through the Regulation (EU) […] [Global Europe], the external dimension and innovative solutions to migration and asylum management would continue in the years to come to play an important part in the EU response. Member States and the EU should also have certain margin to be able to support specific activities in third countries.  Finally, the Pact obligations have created significant needs in terms of personnel, including case workers, legal advisers, monitors for fundamental rights, representatives for unaccompanied minors, vulnerability experts and so on, as well as new obligations regarding reception with significant running costs. These are key components that ensure the European system works in practice. Systemic failures in these areas in one Member State impact all Member States. It is thus fundamental that the EU supports Member States in this endeavour. Furthermore, Member States’ needs will have to be reassessed regularly based on the evaluation of the migratory situation. The ultimate objective is to ensure that all Member State will continuously have a ‘well-prepared system’.  The scope of the Union support should be coherent with the policy priorities and flexible, so to allow for new developments to be taken into account. Building on the results and investments in the areas of asylum and migration from the previous programming periods, this proposal provides the necessary Union support to achieve the objectives of the comprehensive approach to migration and asylum . It also offers support for legal migration and early integration of third-country nationals as well as horizontal measures supporting Member States’ capacities in the field of integration.  Furthermore, Union support should be available for the new common approach and legislative framework proposed by the Commission 1 with swifter, simpler and more effective return procedures across the EU and innovative solutions for migration management . This new legal framework for returns constitutes a key piece to complement the Pact on Migration and Asylum .  The proposal aims to address the need for greater flexibility in the management of the Union support, including a stronger performance orientation, as well as enhanced simplification for all actors involved in its implementation. For this, strict complementarity is enforced with the proposal for a Regulation (EU) […] establishing the European Fund for economic, social and territorial cohesion, agriculture and rural, fisheries and maritime, prosperity and security, introducing new mechanisms for the allocation of funding for shared, direct and indirect management. As challenges in the area of migration and asylum are constantly evolving, there is also a need to respond to pressing needs and changes in policy and Union priorities, and to steer funding towards actions with a high level of Union added value, in particular through an EU Facility offering flexibility in the management of the Union support.  The present proposal, together with the proposal for a Regulation (EU) […] establishing the Union support for the Schengen area, for European integrated border management and for the common policy on visas and the proposal for a Regulation (EU) […] establishing the Union Support for  internal security, provide the specific legal framework for the Union action in the areas of efficient management of migration and asylum, European integrated border management at the external borders, well-functioning Schengen area and European visa policy, and internal security. The rules regulating the participation of some Member States of the European Union to the rules established in accordance with Title V of Part Three TFEU (see variable geometry section) justify the need to have three specific instruments to provide support in these areas. These three Regulations complement each other and the proposal for Regulation (EU) […] establishing the European Fund for economic, social and territorial cohesion, agriculture and rural, fisheries and maritime, prosperity and security, through which they will be implemented.  The proposed Regulation builds on Regulation (EU) 2021/1147 2 , while taking into account new policy developments and the need to provide an agile response to evolving migration and asylum challenges both within the EU and in cooperation with other countries.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions  The Union support for asylum, migration and integration will work in complementarity with the other policies under the scope of the proposal for establishing the European Fund for economic, social and territorial cohesion, agriculture and rural, fisheries and maritime, prosperity and security, thus fostering synergies between these policies. However, a strong and comprehensive EU policy on migration and asylum needs action across the full spectrum of the tools at its disposal, including activities of relevant Union decentralised agencies.  The six Home Affairs decentralised Agencies (Frontex, Europol, EUAA, eu-LISA, EUDA and Cepol) play an important and increasing role in the implementation of the Home Affairs policies. It is essential to ensure coherence between policy strategies set out at EU level and the operational activities of the decentralised agencies, thereby also maximising the contribution to the EU policy objectives from the EU funding provided to the decentralised agencies. The operational role of the decentralised agencies may require further strengthening, accompanied by corresponding increase of funding.  • Consistency with other Union policies  Union migration policy relies on the synergies and coherence with relevant EU policies such as border management, internal security, and the social inclusion and integration of third-country nationals. In addition, consistency and complementarity will also be ensured with the Union external policies supporting third countries through Regulation (EU) […] [Global Europe] in a wide range of areas with important links to internal policies, including migration and asylum, which should ensure an increased coherence with the Union’s support for cooperation on migration with partner countries, contributing to a coordinated, holistic and structured approach to migration, maximising synergies and increasing leverage. In this context, the synergies between the support to cross-border cooperation under Global Europe and the one that can be provided under this Regulation are particularly relevant for enhancing border management and pursuing efforts to prevent irregular migration. To promote those synergies, enhanced coordination and consistency should be sought between policy priorities and EU spending towards third countries.  This proposal is also consistent with the priorities set out in the Union of Skills’ external strand on attracting and retaining skills from third countries, including the future legal gateway offices, which can be supported by initiatives such as the EU Talent Pool and the Talent Partnerships. To support the competitiveness agenda, investments based on innovative methods or new technologies, including measures aiming to test and validate the outcome of Union-funded research projects should also be considered.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  Article 3(2) of the Treaty on European Union provides that ‘the Union shall offer its citizens an area of freedom, security and justice without internal frontiers, in which the free movement of persons is ensured in conjunction with appropriate measures with respect to external border controls, asylum, immigration and the prevention and combating of crime’. The legal basis for this proposal can be found in Article 78(2) as well as in Article 79(2) and Article 79(4) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the Union (TFEU).  • Variable geometry  This Regulation is based on legal bases under Title V of Part Three TFEU, concerning the area of freedom, security and justice. As a consequence, the application of the Regulation to Denmark and Ireland is subject to special provisions laid down in Protocol No 21 and Protocol No 22 annexed to the TEU and the TFEU.  In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No 22, Denmark does not take part in the adoption by the Council of measures proposed pursuant to Title V of Part Three TFEU, and such measures are not binding upon or applicable in Denmark.  In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No 21, Ireland does not take part in the adoption by the Council of measures proposed pursuant to Title V of Part Three TFEU, and such measures are not binding on or applicable in Ireland. However, Ireland may choose to take part in the adoption and application of any such proposed measure. In addition, anytime after the adoption of such a measure, Ireland may accept the measure, subject to the completion of procedures referred to in Article 4 of Protocol No 21.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  The objectives of the proposal cannot be achieved by Member States acting alone, as the challenges are of a cross-border nature, and not limited to single Member States or to a subset of Member States. Union support creates added value by promoting a common approach across Member States when implementing EU acquis and standards and fostering collaboration between Member States on transnational issues.  • Proportionality  The proposal does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives mentioned under section 1. It falls within the scope for action in the area of freedom, security and justice, as defined in Title V of Part Three TFEU. The objectives and corresponding Union support are proportionate to what the instrument aims to achieve.  • Choice of the instrument  The most appropriate instrument for operating the current proposal is a Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council establishing the Union support for asylum, migration and integration for the period from 1 January 2028 to 31 December 2034, complementing the proposal for Regulation (EU) […] establishing the European Fund for economic, social and territorial cohesion, agriculture and rural, fisheries and maritime, prosperity and security.  3. RESULTS OF RETROSPECTIVE EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Retrospective evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  The preliminary outcomes of the ongoing ex-post evaluation of the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) for the 2014-2020 programming period confirm that the AMIF contributed to the objectives intended by the Fund to a variable extent. Stakeholders perceived the administrative burden as proportionate to the benefits and similar to other EU Funds, but less proportionate in comparison to national funds. The introduction of simplified cost options was viewed positively, although their use was relatively limited. The AMIF demonstrated good coherence with the European Social Fund, which according to stakeholders could be further reinforced. The AMIF strongly contributed to the introduction of new services, the ability to reach a broader audience and the expansion of services and innovation. Overall, the ex-post evaluation underlines the need to enhance simplification in the implementation of the fund, notably by reducing reporting requirements and expanding the use of simplified cost options. The evaluation also pleads for reducing rigidities in the management of the budget, including by introducing more flexible budgeting mechanisms easing cross-fertilisation between different objectives and decreasing the number of programmes’ modifications.  The preliminary outcomes of the mid-term evaluation of the AMIF for the 2021-2027 programming period confirm that the monitoring and evaluation framework for AMIF has significantly improved compared to the 2014-2020 programming period. Simplified cost options and flat-rate technical assistance have contributed to reducing administrative burden, yet the implementation of simplified cost options is still relatively limited. The AMIF demonstrates strong coherence with the programming of other EU Funds, particularly the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+), the Instrument for financial support for Border Management and Visa Policy (BMVI) and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF). The mid-term evaluation broadly confirms the conclusions of the ex-post evaluation concerning the need for more simplification and flexibility in the management of the programmes and projects, to adapt quickly to the impact of external factors. The mid-term evaluation underlines the need to reinforce the links and coordination with the other Union Funds, especially in view of the implementation of the Pact on Migration and Asylum. This could also help national authorities to better cover relevant needs through a more coordinated programming of the Union Funds.  • Stakeholder consultations  The Commission actively engaged with the stakeholders in the process of the initiative, notably through dedicated events and public consultation activities, as detailed in the corresponding chapter of the explanatory memorandum of the proposal for a Regulation (EU) […] establishing the European Fund for economic, social and territorial cohesion, agriculture and rural, fisheries and maritime, prosperity and security.  • External expertise  Information about the Commission’s use of external expertise is provided in the corresponding chapter of the explanatory memorandum of the proposal for a Regulation (EU) […] establishing the European Fund for economic, social and territorial cohesion, agriculture and rural, fisheries and maritime, prosperity and security.  • Impact assessment  Information about the Commission’s Impact Assessment is provided in the corresponding chapter of the explanatory memorandum of the proposal for a Regulation (EU) […] establishing the European Fund for economic, social and territorial cohesion, agriculture and rural, fisheries and maritime, prosperity and security.  • Simplification  The initiative is expected to contribute to a significant reduction of administrative burden and costs, as well as improved efficiency in the implementation of Union support, see also the corresponding chapter of the explanatory memorandum of the proposal for a Regulation (EU) […] establishing the European Fund for economic, social and territorial cohesion, agriculture and rural, fisheries and maritime, prosperity and security.  • Fundamental rights  The Union support will be implemented in compliance with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the principle of the rule of law, as set out in Article 2(a) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2020/2092, see also the corresponding section in the Explanatory Memorandum accompanying the Commission proposal for the proposal for a Regulation (EU) […] establishing the European Fund for economic, social and territorial cohesion, agriculture and rural, fisheries and maritime, prosperity and security.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  The indicative financial envelope for the implementation of the objectives under the Union support is set at EUR 11 975 428 500 for the period from 2028 to 2034 in current prices. It shall be implemented in compliance with the horizontal rules for the National and Regional Partnership Plans laid down in Regulation (EU) […] establishing the European Fund for economic, social and territorial cohesion, agriculture and rural, fisheries and maritime, prosperity and security.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  The Union support under this proposal will be implemented through shared management by the Member States and direct and indirect management by the Commission. The implementation of the Union support will be monitored through the performance framework applicable for the 2028-2034 multiannual financial framework set out in the proposal for a Regulation (EU) […] establishing a budget expenditure tracking and performance framework and other horizontal rules of the Union programmes and activities.  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  The proposed Regulation defines in Article 1 the scope of the Union support for the Asylum, Migration and Integration for the period from 1 January 2028 to 31 December 2034. For this, essential definitions are given in Article 2, and four objectives are set out in Article 3, which will be achieved through Union support under the horizontal rules of the European Fund for economic, social and territorial cohesion, agriculture and rural, fisheries and maritime, prosperity and security established by Regulation (EU) […]. These objectives refer to the areas of the Common European Asylum System; return and readmission of irregular migrants, including their reintegration in third countries and countering irregular migration; legal migration and early integration and social inclusion of third-country nationals; solidarity and fair sharing of responsibility between the Member States.  In Article 4 the proposal lays down provisions for the financing of the Union support  To foster the implementation of the Union acquis and to support efforts to ensure a comprehensive approach to the management of migration grounded on mutual trust, solidarity and fair sharing of responsibility between Member States, the proposed Regulation also sets out the rules for the budgetary treatment of the resources for resettlement and humanitarian admission (Article 5 ) , the resources for the transfer of applicants for international protection or of beneficiaries of international protection (Article 6 ) , and the financial contributions from Member States for the purpose of the Annual Solidarity Pool established by Regulation (EU) 2024/1351 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 May 2024 3 (Article 9 ) .  Article 7 defines the necessary conditions to be fulfilled by third countries to be associated to the Union support provided under this proposal . Article 8 covers the funding of the European Migration Network set up by Council Decision 2008/381/EC 4 in accordance with its objectives and tasks. Article 1 0 lays down transitional provisions . The date of the entry into force of the proposed Regulation is set in Article 1 1 , and it is stipulated that the Regulation will be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States in accordance with the Treaties from 1 January 2028.  2025/0540 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  establishing the Union support for asylum, migration and integration for the period from 2028 to 2034  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 78(2) and Article 79(2) and (4) thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 5 ,  After consulting the Committee of the Regions,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure 6 ,  Whereas:  (1) The purpose of this Regulation is to contribute to the Union’s objective of constituting an area of freedom, security and justice in accordance with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) through provision of Union support for the development of a common policy on asylum, subsidiary protection and temporary protection with a view to offering appropriate status to any third-country nation al requiring international protection and ensuring compliance with the principle of non-refoulement in accordance with Article 77 TFEU,  and a common immigration policy aimed at ensuring, at all stages, the efficient management of migration flows, fair treatment of third-country nationals residing legally in Member States, and the prevention of, and enhanced measures to combat, illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings in accordance with Article 79 TFEU.  (2) The entry into force of the Pact on Migration and Asylum in June 2024 has reshaped the Union’s asylum and migration policy. To foster t he implementation of the Pact and to support efforts to ensure a comprehensive approach to the management of migration that is grounded on solidarity and fair sharing of responsibility between Member States, Union institutions and agencies, Member States should be supported by adequate financial resources. This Union support will be provided under the horizontal rules of the European Fund for economic, social and territorial cohesion, agriculture and rural, fisheries and maritime, prosperity and security established by Regulation (EU) […] .  (3) This Regulation lays down the objectives of the Union support on asylum, migration and integration policy. Member States should ensure that their National and Regional Partnership Plan s address each of the objectives set out by this Regulation.  (4) The amounts to be allocated per Member State should be set out by the Commission in accordance with the allocation methodology laid down in Regulation (EU) […] establishing the European Fund for economic, social and territorial cohesion, agriculture and rural, fisheries and maritime, prosperity and security through a single implementing decision. That decision should as a rule also cover the amounts under the Regulation (EU) […] establishing the European Fund for economic, social and territorial cohesion, agriculture and rural, fisheries and maritime, prosperity and security , the Regulation (EU) […] establishing the Union support for the Schengen area, for European integrated border management and for the common policy on visas and the Regulation (EU) […] establishing the Union Support for  internal security .  (5) The Union support should build on the results and investments in the areas of asylum and migration from the previous programming periods: (i) the European Refugee Fund established by Decision No 573/2007/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 7 for the period 2008-2013 ; (ii) the European Fund for the Integration of third-country nationals established by Council Decision 2007/435/EC 8 for the period 2007-2013 ; (iii) the European Return Fund established by Decision No 575/2007/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 9 for the period 2008-2013 ; (iv) the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund established by Regulation (EU) No 516/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council 10 for the period 2014-2020, and (v) the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund for the period 2021-2027, established by Regulation (EU) 2021/1147 of the European Parliament and of the Council 11 . The scope of the Union support should also allow for new developments to be taken into account.  (6) Europe’s geopolitical context has significantly changed, profoundly affecting the Union’s migration management, also due to the role of State actors in artificially creating and facilitating irregular migration, instrumentalising migratory flows as a tool for political purposes, and to the use of hybrid warfare tactics, such as the weaponi s ation of migration 12 , to destabilise the European Union and its Member States . Member States need to be able to rapidly and effectively respond to developments of migratory flows and receive Union support for that purpose. To respond to these European challenges, the allocation of Union support should reflect the Union’s priorities . Therefore, the Union support implemented under the rules governing the Member States National and Regional Partnership Plans should contribute to effectively addressing the challenges identified in the context of the long-term European Asylum and Migration Management Strategy and the annual migration management cycle established in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2024/1351 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 May 2024 13 , including the annual solidarity mechanism and the Union Resettlement and Humanitarian Admission Framework.  This Union support under this Regulation should finance measures tailored to the needs of third-country nationals that are generally implemented in the early stages of integration, as well as horizontal measures supporting Member States’ capacities in the field of integration, whereas interventions for third-country nationals with a longer-term impact should be pursued under other Union supports.  (7) As challenges in the area of migration and asylum are constantly evolving, there is a need to adapt the allocation of the Union support under this Regulation to the changes in migration flows and asylum . To respond to pressing needs and changes in policy and Union priorities, and to steer funding towards actions with a high level of Union added value, part of the Union support under this Regulation should be implemented in direct, shared and indirect management via the EU Facility established pursuant to Regulation (EU) […] establishing the European Fund for economic, social and territorial cohesion, agriculture and rural, fisheries and maritime, prosperity and security . The EU Facility offers flexibility in the management of the Union support, and, for shared management, it should be implemented through the Member States’ National and Regional Partnership Plans.  (8) The Commission and the Member States should ensure that the knowledge, expertise and experience of relevant Union bodies, offices and agencies are taken into account in the development of Member States’ National and Regional Plans and when implementing measures or addressing challenges in relation to migration management, border control and management and internal security. Where appropriate, the Commission should also be able to involve the relevant Union bodies, offices and agencies in activities aiming to ensure that the measures supported by the Union support comply with the relevant Union acquis and agreed Union priorities .  (9) The Union support should also contribute to the implementation of temporary protection in relation to Council Directive 2001/55/EC 14 in the event of a mass influx of displaced persons , including of temporary protection introduced and extended by past Council decisions, and the implementation of measures to promote a balance of efforts between the Member States hosting such persons.  (10) The Member States should build on the principle of partnership in the implementation of the Union support to ensure continuity in the governance approach.  (11) The Union support should contribute to ensuring consistency, coherence, synergies and complementarities between the Union’s internal and external policies. An increased coherence is needed between migration, asylum, return and external policies and it is important to ensure that the Union’s external assistance and Union support under this Regulation contribute to a coordinated, holistic and structured approach to migration, maximising synergies and increasing leverage. Union support under this Regulation may also include support to the relevant resources of the EU delegations in duly justified cases, and be coordinated between the Member States and the Commission in programming and implementation stages.  (12) Europe must protect its security interest s against suppliers which could represent a persistent security risk due to the potential interference from third countries as well as their cybersecurity practices. It is therefore necessary to reduce the risk of persisting dependency on high-risk suppliers in the internal market, as they could have potentially serious negative impacts on security for users, companies and authorities across the EU in terms of the integrity of data and services as well as the availability of service. This exclusion should be based on a proportionate risk assessment and associated mitigation measures as defined in the Union policies and laws .  (13) Resettlement and humanitarian admission are safe and legal alternatives to irregular migration and a tool of European solidarity with countries that are not Member States and which host large numbers of persons fleeing war or persecution. Resettlement and humanitarian admission efforts by the Member States undertaken in the framework of Regulation (EU) 2024/1350 of the European Parliament and of the Council 15 should be supported by appropriate funding from the Union's budget. In view of the specific nature of the support needed for purposes of resettlement and humanitarian admission and for the transfer of applicants for international protection or of beneficiaries of international protection, it is necessary to provide in this Regulation for pre-identified amounts per unit for such support.  (14) This Regulation should also ensure the continuation of the European Migration Network set up by Council Decision 2008/381/EC 16 in accordance with its objectives and tasks.  (15) Given that Member States subject to migratory pressure should be able to rely on Union support, this Regulation should set out the rules in order to make available to benefitting Member States the respective share of the financial contributions included in the Annual Solidarity Pool established by Regulation (EU) 2024/1351 17 .  (16) A third country that has concluded an agreement with the Union on the criteria and mechanisms for establishing the State responsible for examining a n application for international protection registered in a Member State or registered in that third country should be allowed to participate in the Union support through this Regulation provided certain conditions are fulfilled.  (17) All actions supported in accordance with the Union support under this Regulation should be implemented in compliance with the rights and principles enshrined in the Union acquis and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and should be in line with the international obligations of the Union and the Member States arising from the international instruments to which they are party.  (18) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No 22 on the position of Denmark, annexed to the TEU and to the TFEU, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application.  (19) [ In accordance with Article 3 of Protocol No 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, annexed to the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and the TFEU, Ireland has notified [, by letter of … ,] its wish to take part in the adoption and application of this Regulation .  OR  In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, annexed to the Treaty of the European Union (TEU) and to the TFEU, and without prejudice to Article 4 of that Protocol, Ireland is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application],  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Article 1  Subject matter  This Regulation lays down the objectives and financing of the Union support for the implementation, strengthening and development of the common policy on asylum and the common immigration policy for the period from 1 January 2028 to 31 December 2034.

This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in the Member States in accordance with the Treaties.  Done at Brussels,  For the European Parliament For the Council  The President The President",,,,,,,,,,,,,"The European Commission has proposed a regulation to establish Union support for asylum, migration, and integration from 2028 to 2034, aiming to address migration as a collective challenge within the European Union. This proposal builds on the Pact on Migration and Asylum, seeking to create a comprehensive approach to managing asylum, migration, and border control through solidarity and shared responsibility among EU member states. It emphasizes the need for member states to develop efficient national systems, including significant financial investments in integrated case management systems and digitalization efforts, such as the use of artificial intelligence, to improve efficiency. The proposal also highlights the importance of supporting personnel needs, like case workers and legal advisers, to ensure the system functions effectively across the EU.

To address evolving challenges in migration and asylum, the proposal introduces mechanisms for flexible and performance-oriented management of Union support, aligning with policy priorities and adapting to new developments. It complements other EU funds aimed at economic and social cohesion and seeks to support legal migration, early integration of third-country nationals, and innovative solutions for migration management. The proposal is part of a broader legal framework that includes regulations for the Schengen area, European integrated border management, and internal security, ensuring coherence and complementarity with existing EU policies.

The proposal underscores the importance of consistency with other Union policies, such as border management, internal security, and the social inclusion and integration of third-country nationals. It also highlights the role of decentralized agencies like Frontex and Europol. Financial assistance for activities related",

a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  establishing the 'AgoraEU' programme for the period 2028-2034, and repealing Regulations (EU) 2021/692 and (EU) 2021/818  {SEC(2025) 547 final} - {SWD(2025) 550 final} - {SWD(2025) 551 final}  EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM  1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  The EU is a community of values ingrained in Europe's history and identity and anchored in the EU Treaty. As set out in Article 2 of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU), these are common to all Member States and encompass democracy, respect for human rights, non-discrimination, equality, the rule of law, and pluralism, with cultural diversity, freedom of expression, including media and artistic freedom and pluralism, also being enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU.  Citizens’ participation and engagement, transparency and accountability in decision-making, as well as respect for fundamental rights and the rule of law contribute to the vitality of European democracy. Media plays a crucial role in fostering public opinion and free debate. Audiovisual content and all other forms of artistic, cultural and creative expressions, including cultural heritage, are essential to Europe’s diversity and to forging societal resilience and mutual understanding. Beyond their intrinsic value and social impact, they are powerful drivers of sustainable economic growth and competitiveness, innovation and employment, and soft power, making them essential to Europe’s future.  The importance of an EU financial intervention in these areas lies in their ability to foster inclusive and participatory governance, facilitate informed and active citizenship, safeguard and promote fundamental rights, promote equality and non-discrimination, and celebrate cultural diversity and all types of artistic expressions. Europe’s thriving creative and media sectors, its audiovisual industry and the richness of its cultures and heritage are central to its identity. However, these policy areas face serious challenges that require a holistic Union response.  Union values are the object of internal and external pressures, such as challenges to the rule of law, inequalities, discrimination, violations of fundamental rights, declining trust in democratic institutions as well as weakened confidence in democratic processes. Structural inequalities persist as well as violence and discrimination on the grounds of sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation, often shown in racism and other forms of intolerance. Meanwhile, the traditional role of independent civil society organisations in counterbalancing these trends is challenged by a weakening of financial and political support.  The European media industries are a beacon of quality and creativity, but today they compete with global online platforms for the attention of citizens and consumers. Circulation of EU audiovisual content continues to be fragmented along national lines, and non-EU players capture most of the box office and streaming subscriptions. While the video game industry has gained a strong foothold in contemporary digital culture (more than half of the EU population regularly plays video games), the Union’s video game market continues to be largely dominated by global competitors. Finally, the integrity of the information space is at risk through the spread of disinformation and the growth of foreign information manipulation and interference by hostile actors, such as Russia. Threats against media pluralism are compounded by phenomena such as concentration of media ownership. In parallel, news media experience declining advertising revenues and sales, as digital competitors have captured an increasing share of revenue and shaped consumption habits. As a result of all these factors, media viability is under pressure.  Culture and the cultural and creative sectors and industries in the Union are fragmented as well along national and linguistic lines, reflecting our rich diversity. This limits transnational artistic collaboration, audience reach, the development of innovative practices, as well as the sectors’ resilience and potential for competitiveness, and strengthening societal wellbeing. Culture and creative sectors’ professionals struggle to work across borders and to access new opportunities and markets, which exacerbates geographical imbalances and reduces the circulation of European cultural works. The limited cross-border mobility and cooperation hinders networking, economies of scale, pooling expertise, and co-creation, all that is crucial for sustaining careers and strong culture and creative sectors. Meanwhile, Europe’s rich cultural heritage faces threats from a combination of budgetary constraints, vulnerability to pollution, climate change and natural disasters, as well as misappropriation or destruction.  Finally, societal, creative, cultural and media sectors experience common technological dependencies and could benefit from common activities. They are impacted by financial weaknesses, obstacles to accessing finance, difficulties in using and uptaking applied innovation, lack of adaptation to new sets of skills and digital transformation. Meanwhile, non-EU tech giants increasingly influence the civic, media, and cultural landscape, shaping content consumption through algorithmic recommendations, automated distribution and AI-generated content.  These are challenges of a transnational nature that cannot be effectively addressed without joint EU-level solutions, coordination, steering and support. EU actions can help enable cooperation, capacity building, and mutual learning, as well as optimise and combine the potential of these sectors to contribute to economic growth, societal development and cultural diversity.  EU support to address challenges affecting culture, media, and equality, citizens, rights and Union values has been provided through different funding programmes over the years. In the 2021-2027 Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), support to culture, the cultural and creative sectors and the audiovisual industries was addressed by Creative Europe, with the objectives of safeguarding, developing and promoting European cultural and linguistic diversity and heritage and contributing to the competitiveness of these sectors, notably the audiovisual sector. Meanwhile, the promotion and protection of rights and Union values as enshrined in the Treaties, the Charter and the applicable international human rights convention were primarily the object of the Citizens, Equality, Rights and Values (CERV) programme. CERV has supported civil society organisations working at European, national, regional and local levels, including grassroots, in their work to protect and promote Union values. The Union support in some areas, such as news media and countering disinformation, was fragmented across different programmes. The cross - sectoral strand of Cre ative Europe included specific actions on media pluralism, literacy, and media collaborations, while the Multimedia actions line supported the provision of information on EU topics. Tackling disinformation has so far been funded through Digital Europe.  The 2028-2034 MFF proposal aims at addressing ‘complexities, weaknesses and rigidities’ currently present in the EU’s budget, and provides a framework that is more focused, simpler, with fewer and more impactful programmes. For this reason, and to increase the budget’s flexibility and ability to respond to changing realities and emerging problems, this proposal seeks to streamline the EU intervention in the areas of culture, media and equality, citizens, rights and values, exploiting connections and synergies where relevant, while respecting the singularity and specific needs of each of these policy areas.  In the area of equality, citizens, rights and values, the proposal will contribute to upholding democracy and the rule of law, fundamental rights and equality, reducing discrimination and empowering civil society. The new Programme will contribute as well to fighting against gender-based violence, violence against children and other groups at risk. In addition, it will contribute to enhancing democratic resilience and participation.  Media is a driver of democratic values, cultural diversity and economic growth. The media sector encompasses inter alia content such as films, series, video games, news and information, immersive reality and multimedia, as well as services including theatrical exhibition, television and radio broadcasting, print and online publishing, online videos and podcasts. To be socially relevant, the audiovisual and media industries need to be resilient and competitive. The proposal will support a free, competitive and diverse media and audiovisual space. It will on one hand enhance the production, circulation, IP exploitation and consumption of audiovisual works and other forms of media content, such as gaming. On the other hand, it will contribute to protecting the viability and pluralism of the information market, notably by supporting news media and media independence including at regional and local levels. It will also contribute to tackling disinformation and foreign information manipulation and interference.  Culture and the cultural and creative sectors are great assets for Europe, projecting the image of a dynamic continent on the world stage. Encompassing inter alia performing arts, literature and book publishing, music and visual arts, tangible and intangible cultural heritage, architecture, archives, libraries and museums, artistic crafts and design, they produce meanings on various mediums and through multiple formats. The EU intervention in the field of culture will contribute to increasing cross-border cultural creation and cooperation, cultural participation and accessibility to a diversity of European cultural expressions and to protecting and preserving cultural heritage. The proposal will also help increase the circulation of a diversity of cultural works and the mobility of professionals, as well as promote inclusiveness and intergenerational fairness through culture. Finally, it will strengthen the social, economic and external dimensions of the cultural and creative sectors.  Finally, the EU should promote synergies among the media, culture, and civic spheres, bringing together public and private entities as well as promoting cross-sectoral cooperation, and innovation, to address common challenges and contribute to societal resilience and democratic participation.  On this basis, the EU financing intervention will be best equipped to enhance and scale up existing successful schemes, to better address transnational challenges, and to fill gaps impossible to address at Member States level. It will also provide wider coherence and better alignment between regulatory policy and funding instruments, as well as between internal and external policies. Therefore, the proposal will contribute to reinforcing Europe’s societies, media and culture, and foster Union values and democratic participation and help unlock the full potential of the Union as a source of progress, sustainable development and growth.  The policy areas covered by this legal proposal are firmly anchored in the EU Treaties, which provide the legal bases for EU action through Union funding programmes, and they contribute to the Union’s long-term objectives. The proposal provides for a date of application as of 1 January 2028.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  Fundamental rights, EU values and democracy  The proposal is fully in line with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, and all relevant EU policy and legislative frameworks in the field of equality and non-discrimination. It also contributes to the Union of Equality strategy. A core ambition of the European Union is to ensure, through a multi stakeholder and intersectoral approach, that all people, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation, age, religion or belief, can live free from discrimination and participate fully in society.  The European Union’s commitment to equality is anchored in numerous key communications and action plans. The European Commission’s 2020 Strategy for the Equality of LGBTIQ People and the 2021 Gender Equality Strategy underscore the EU’s dedication to tackling discrimination and promoting equality across all aspects of society. Both strategies will be renewed, as the current ones end in 2025. These are complemented by the upcoming EU Anti-Racism Strategy 2026-2030, the EU Roma Strategic Framework for Equality, Inclusion and Participation (2020–2030), the Strategy for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2021–2030), and the EU Strategy on the Rights of the Child, the EU Strategy on combating antisemitism and fostering Jewish life (2021-2030) and the work strand on combatting anti-Muslim hatred. The upcoming Intergenerational Fairness Strategy is also of relevance in this context.  The first EU comprehensive framework on democracy has been developed through the 2020 European Democracy Action Plan, the 2021 package of measures to reinforce democracy and protect the integrity of elections and the 2023 Defence of Democracy Package in synergy with the External Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy 2020-2027. The most recent legislation in this context includes the Regulation on transparency of political advertising, and the EU law protecting persons who engage in public participation from manifestly unfounded claims or abusive court proceedings ('strategic lawsuits against public participation').  The upcoming European Democracy Shield will seek to further protect and strengthen democracy and democratic resilience. It will seek to address the increasing threats to democratic institutions, systems and processes within the EU and to enhance citizens’ trust and participation in democracy. The upcoming EU Civil Society Strategy will seek to further protect and empower civil society, sending a strong signal of recognition to the work carried out by civil society and their contribution to EU policies.  Media and audiovisual  This legal proposal also builds upon the EU media and audiovisual framework, where regulation, funding and policy effectively support each other, thereby facilitating democratic debate, enriching our culture, and driving the digital transformation with competitive EU media players.  It will accompany EU single market policies in the audiovisual and media sectors, and its design will complement and reinforce existing legislative instruments. The Audiovisual Media Services Directive (AVMSD) has laid down a common regulatory framework for audiovisual media services across the EU, including provisions such as the promotion of European and independent works, protection of minors, and regulation of audiovisual advertising. Together with AVMSD, the proposed Programme will strengthen the capacity of European audiovisual players to finance, produce and disseminate works that can be sufficiently visible on the different media available and are attractive to audiences in an increasingly open and competitive market within Europe and beyond.  The recently adopted European Media Freedom Act (EMFA) provides safeguards for media freedom and pluralism, including protections against political interference, enhanced transparency of media ownership, and obligations on the independence of public service media. The proposed Programme will complement EMFA by providing financial support to news media outlets and strengthening editorial independence.  It will also build on the Code of conduct on countering hate speech online, the 2018 Action Plan against disinformation , and the Code of Conduct on Disinformation recently integrated within the co-regulatory framework of the Digital Services Act (DSA) , by enhancing media literacy and reinforcing situation awareness on the online information space across Member States.  Culture  Concerning culture, cultural heritage and the cultural and creative sectors, the initiative will accompany the upcoming Culture Compass for Europe , which is intended as a strategic policy approach aiming to embed culture and the CCS in the Union’s overarching policy goals and to guide and harness their multiple dimensions.  The initiative builds on several key policy initiatives, including the European Agenda for Culture , the Council’s Work Plans for Culture , the EU Strategy for International Cultural Relations , and the European Framework for Action on Cultural Heritage , which all plea for a stronger role for culture and the CCS in the further social, economic and international development of our Union. It aligns with European initiatives such as the New European Bauhaus , the European Capitals of Culture action and the European Heritage Label action. It is also in line with the Rome Declaration of March 2017, where the Member States and EU institutions envisioned a Union “where citizens have new opportunities for cultural and social development and economic growth [...]; a Union which preserves our cultural heritage and promotes cultural diversity”.  Furthermore, it is consistent with the Commission Communication on Strengthening European Identity through Education and Culture, which states that it is in the shared interest of all Member States “to harness the full potential of education and culture as drivers for jobs, economic growth, social fairness, active citizenship as well as a means to experience European identity in all its diversity”. The initiative is also in line with the 2005 UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions , to which the Union and its Member States are parties.  Finally, the initiative is to be seen in the context of the upcoming EU Strategy on sustainable Tourism, aiming among others to support visitors in discovering lesser-known cultural routes and heritage sites across Europe, thus fostering economic development and promoting local jobs.  • Consistency with other Union policies  The initiative is aligned with the overarching Commission’s 2024-2029 policy priorities, namely in terms of 1) Supporting people, strengthening our societies and our social model; 2) Protecting our democracy, upholding our values; 3) Europe’s sustainable prosperity and competitiveness; and 4) a global Europe.  Consistency with policies supporting people, strengthening our societies and our social model  In the context of the Multiannual Financial Framework (2028-2034), synergies will be fostered between media, culture, equality, rights and values initiatives and the future intervention in the fields of skills, education, social inclusion, solidarity, intergenerational fairness, youth and social and territorial cohesion. These synergies, such as in media literacy, digital skills, civic engagement and civic education and skills development and inclusion through creativity and the arts will be promoted in line with the objectives of the European Youth Strategy and the EU Citizenship Report.  The initiative may also seek synergies and complementarities with future interventions under shared management aimed at strengthening social and territorial cohesion within the EU.  The initiative complements some initiatives promoting the principles of the European Pillar of Social Rights, including through employment and social policies, as well as of the European Child Guarantee. This includes promoting equal access to rights and fostering diversity, including at the regional and local level, as means to support social inclusion and fair labour markets, and to tackle child poverty. As key actors in shaping public discourse and fostering democratic engagement, culture and media are central to building inclusive, resilient societies. In the context of the Union of Skills, the initiative will actively contribute to the upskilling and reskilling of professionals in the cultural and creative industries (CCIs), supporting their adaptability in the face of digital and green transitions and labour market shifts. Furthermore, by reinforcing the competitiveness of cultural and creative sectors, the Programme favours the creation of jobs in these sectors. At the same time, the initiative will enhance capacity-building for civil society organisations (CSOs) working in the field of equality, rights and values.  In light of increasing risks linked to natural hazards, health emergencies, technological accidents, evolving security threats, and other disruptions, this initiative will enhance the resilience of vital societal functions, and build a more resilient, secure, and prepared Union, in line with the objectives of the EU Preparedness Union Strategy .  Consistency with justice policies  The alignment between justice policies and the rule of law creates a robust framework that ensures accountability, promotes legal coherence across and within Member States, and protects fundamental rights, thereby enhancing trust and cooperation within the Union. The relationship between fundamental rights and justice policies is key in shaping fair and equitable societies. Fundamental rights – ranging from the right to a fair trial, freedom from discrimination to the protection of privacy – define the essential standards that justice systems must uphold, and translate abstract principles into concrete legal measures and practices. For instance, anti-discrimination laws enforce the principle of equality before the law.  Thus, the synergy between fundamental rights and justice policies ensures that legal systems not only prevent abuses but also actively promote dignity, equality, and freedom. This synergy is essential for building public trust in legal institutions, fostering social cohesion, and ultimately ensuring that justice is accessible and meaningful for all individuals. To this end, in the context of the Multiannual Financial Framework (2028-2034), synergies will be fostered between this Programme and the future Justice programme.  Consistency with policies for the Single Market and competitiveness  By contributing to the competitiveness of media, audiovisual and the cultural and creative sectors, the initiative will complement the EU policy framework on industrial policy and economic competitiveness. Notably, it builds on the 2024 Single Market and Competitiveness Report, which adopts an ecosystem-based approach to strengthen the resilience and strategic autonomy of key industrial sectors, including cultural and creative industries. It also reflects the objectives of the Competitiveness Compass, which sets out clear benchmarks to improve the EU’s long-term productivity and resilience and promote innovation.  In addition, the initiative relates to the 2020 Commission Communication “An SME Strategy for a sustainable and digital Europe”, which aims to unleash the power of Europe’s SMEs to lead the twin transitions, based on three pillars: capacity-building and support; reducing regulatory burden and improving market access; and improving access to financing. The initiative also contributes to the European Commission’s new Savings and Investments Union Strategy, which aims to enhance financial opportunities for businesses.  Research and innovation are essential to developing inclusive, rights-based cultural, creative, and media systems. The initiative will strengthen synergies with the future Framework Programme for research and innovation and the future European Competitiveness Fund. The latter includes support for multidisciplinary research on a variety of topics, including democracy, values, equality, and disinformation, but also on digital and industrial topics closely linked to the culture and creative sectors and cultural heritage. Synergies and complementarities will need to be strengthened to reinforce the European research ecosystem, so that the cultural and creative sectors and civil society fully benefit from the advances of European research and innovation areas. The Programme will thus contribute to the take-up of the results of research and innovation actions funded under the Research Framework Programme.  Moreover, the proposal contributes to addressing Europe’s digital transformation, in line with the objectives of the Digital Decade 2030. It will complement it by supporting actions that promote digital preparedness, skills development and applied innovation in the societal, culture and media sectors, such as the AI Continent Action Plan and the Apply AI strategy. It will also accompany existing regulation, such as the Digital Services Act, the Digital Markets Act and the AI Act by increasing the audiovisual and media content access, strengthening media literacy, encouraging fair competition and platform-neutral access to audiences. Cross-border collaborations and availability of audiovisual content would also strengthen interoperability of digital products.  Consistency with policies for a global Europe  The proposed Programme will, once adopted, complement actions financed through the Union’s external actions. For instance, by promoting cultural exchanges and supporting Union creative industries, media and audiovisual content globally including through international collaborations, it will open new markets, attract global talent, enhance the EU’s influence and attractiveness on the world stage. The future intervention will include participation of third countries in the Programme and support for international collaborations, allowing for synergies with EU’s policies on external action.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  The proposal is based on Articles 19(2), 21(2), 24, 167(5), 168(5) and 173(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), to achieve the Programme’s general objectives in a comprehensive way.  Article 19(2) TFEU provides for the adoption of incentive measures to support Member State action in combating discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation.  Democratic engagement, civic participation and the fostering of civil society are essential building blocks of the notion of Union citizenship. They constitute crucial factors and facilitators of the right to move and reside freely in the Union.  Article 21(2) TFEU provides for Union measures to facilitate the exercise of citizens’ rights to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States. Actions to inform citizens and authorities about citizens voting rights when residing in another Member State can also be covered by this Article, since in practice they also facilitate the exercise of a citizen’s right to move and reside freely.  Art icle 24 TFEU obliges the European Parliament and the Council to adopt provisions for the procedures and conditions required for a citizens ’ initiative within the meaning of Article 11 TEU. This has been done by adopting Regulation (EU) 2019/788 of the European Parliament and of the Council 1 . The Programme should support the financing of technical and organisational support for the implementation of that Regulation, thereby underpinning the exercise by citizens of the right to launch and support European citizens’ initiatives. Together with the other rights set out in Article 24 TFEU, that right ensures citizens’ direct participation in the democratic life of the Union.  Article 167(5) TFEU tasks the Union to adopt incentive measures to contribute to the flowering of the cultures of the Member States, while respecting their national and regional diversity and by bringing forward the common cultural heritage. The actions by the Union shall encourage co-operation between Member States and supplement their actions in areas such as improvement of the knowledge and dissemination of the culture and history of the European peoples and conservation and safeguarding of cultural heritage of European significance.  Article 168(5) TFEU provides a legal basis for the adoption of incentive measures designed to protect and improve human health. Violence, including against children and women, constitutes a danger to physical and mental health. Children are vulnerable citizens and need an increased level of protection against these dangers, which often include cross border threats. Violence against women also constitutes a serious threat to the physical and mental health of victims, who are in need of a high level of protection.  Article 173(3) TFEU states that the Union may decide on specific measures in support of action taken in the Member States to ensure that the conditions necessary for the competitiveness of the Union's industry exist, including taking action to encourage an environment favourable to initiative and to the development of undertakings.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  The promotion and protection of culture, media and Union values requires transnational cooperation and coordinated efforts that extend beyond national borders. These are areas where the complexity of the challenges makes it difficult for Member States to address them sufficiently on their own. Coordinated action at EU level allows for more coherent and impactful responses to address transnational and common challenges that slow down progress and allow systemic impact through the identification and the resolution of structural gaps not prioritised by Member States. The EU budget plays a key role in enabling these collective responses. Such an approach also ensures greater coherence between internal policies and the Union’s promotion of its values and international standards abroad.  By reason of the scale and effects of the proposed programme, a Union-level action brings added value, as these objectives cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States acting alone. For instance, it strengthens a sense of EU citizenship and mutual understanding by facilitating cross-border activities that foster civic engagement, solidarity, and wider participation in culture and media. It also ensures consistent and high standards across the EU and effective application of rights enshrined in EU law across Member States, which is essential for the protection of EU citizens. Moreover, EU action reinforces the Single Market by promoting fair access and mobility, while enabling more efficient delivery through coordinated frameworks and larger-scale joint projects. By addressing fragmentation, promoting collaboration across Member States and pooling resources at EU level, the initiative ensures that creative industries, audiovisual and media companies and creators can fully benefit from the Single Market. It improves access to diverse cultural and creative content, supports media pluralism, and increases the competitiveness of the European audiovisual industry.  The added value of EU funding in these policy areas was highlighted by a vast majority of respondents to the open public consultation carried out by the Commission for the new EU programmes (see below).  • Proportionality  The proposal complies with the principle of proportionality, in that it does not go beyond the minimum required to achieve the stated objectives at EU level and what is necessary for those purposes.  • Choice of the instrument  The new ‘AgoraEU’ Programme builds primarily on the Creative Europe Programme (2021-2027), the Citizens, Equality, Rights and Values (CERV) Programme (2021-2027) and existing prerogative lines, bringing together EU financial support to sustain culture, media and Union values. The new instrument takes into account the specific features of the different sectors, their different target groups, and particular needs, while ensuring synergies and complementarities.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  The Commission has taken into account the results of the final evaluation of the Creative Europe programme 2014-2020 and interim final evaluation of the Creative Europe programme 2021-2027, as well as the interim evaluation of the CERV programme and the final evaluations of the Europe for Citizens programme and the Rights, Equality and Citizens programmes, which were carried out over the period 2023-2025.  These evaluations assessed the performance of the programmes, based on their effectiveness, efficiency, relevance, coherence, sustainability and EU added value.  The results of these evaluations indicate that the existing programmes have largely delivered on their policy objectives and provided EU added value, while highlighting areas for improvement in terms of design.  The evaluation of Creative Europe underscores the contribution of the Programme to the general objective of supporting cultural and linguistic diversity and cultural heritage by increasing people’s access to a variety of content coming in particular from beyond national borders and to the objective of competitiveness by helping audiovisual and other creative and cultural operators to improve their skills and scale up at European level. It has a unique place as the only source of funding for transnational cooperation, exchange of good practices, circulation and mobility in these sectors.  The interim evaluation of the CERV programme confirmed that the programme occupies an otherwise largely empty space in the values and fundamental rights funding landscape, as the dedicated EU instrument to safeguard and promote fundamental rights, equality and non-discrimination, democracy and the rule of law in Europe. The evaluation also showed the key role played by the programme in supporting civil society organisations working on rights and values, including those at the grassroots level, who would often lack other funding sources and forms of support.  The evaluation of the Multimedia Actions line (2021-2023) confirms that it was effective in strengthening news coverage on EU affairs from a European perspective. The actions supported the production of a high volume of original content, achieving a notable audience reach.  • Stakeholder consultations  A public consultation informed the impact assessment for EU programmes in the domains of cross-border education, youth, culture, media, values and civil society under the post-2027 MFF. It was conducted between 12 February and 7 May 2025. In total, the consultation gathered 5,845 valid replies.  The responses revealed a clear affirmation of the EU’s continued role in fostering cross-border cooperation and supporting culture, media, democracy and fundamental rights. For example, the proportions of respondents finding it ‘very important’ or ‘important’ to ‘protect democracy and democratic standards’, to ‘promote respect of fundamental rights (including children’s and women’s rights)’, to ‘promote media independence and media pluralism, fight against disinformation’ and to ‘promote cultural and creative diversity’ were respectively at 91%, 88%, 85% and 78%.  The responses to the public consultation also confirmed that EU funding provided added value compared to funding at national, local or regional level in the areas it covered. For example, 66% of respondents considered that ‘Protecting democracy and promoting democratic standards’ is an area where EU funding provides significant added value. Nearly two thirds of respondents mentioned support to the audiovisual and media sectors as an “important” policy objective. Finally, approximately 80% of respondents see an added value in EU funding going to ‘Promote cultural and linguistic diversity’ and ‘Promote and preserve cultural heritage and European remembrance’ and 74% to ‘Ensure widespread access to culture and cultural heritage’.  Asked to evaluate the obstacles preventing the EU budget from fully delivering on its objectives in the policy areas, respondents generally welcomed the Commission’s focus on greater efficiency in funding, but not at the cost of “identity” and “trust”, preserving thematic clarity and stakeholder ownership.  Quantitative results show that the most frequently cited obstacles across all groups were administrative burden (identified by 51% of citizens and 56% of organisations) and complex, fund-specific compliance rules (49% of citizens and 52% of organisations). These issues reflect concerns not only with regulatory complexity but also with fragmentation between instruments and inefficiencies in delivery. Additional barriers included lack of flexibility to reallocate resources in response to emerging needs (45% of citizens and 50% of organisations), delays in programme implementation and funding disbursement, and insufficient communication or clarity about funding opportunities. Public authorities and NGOs in particular emphasised delays as a source of reduced impact and local credibility.  • Collection and use of expertise  The proposal has been informed by external reports and assessments.  The proposal has been informed by a wealth of studies and reports, such as from the European Parliament, the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights and the European Institute for Gender Equality, which point towards the growing and serious challenges testing fundamental rights and values in the EU as well as the resilience of our democratic institutions 2 .  In the field of media and audiovisual, it has relied on the conclusions of the 2023 European Media Industry Outlook 3 , which provided valuable insights into the structural challenges of the media and audiovisual industries (incl. gaming). M edia companies in the EU are under increasing pressure from global competitors for users’ attention and revenue. Consumer spending and media consumption have stagnated since the COVID-19 pandemic , with digital platforms aggregating more content and capturing more ad revenue than traditional media. T he sectors also struggle with high technology adoption costs, limited private investment, and heavy dependence on non-EU technologies. In addition, the report revealed that, in the EU, the circulation of audiovisual work s across borders is limited, hindering the industry’s potential. Meanwhile, the viability of news media is increasingly at risk, with declining revenues, shrinking employment, and limited consumer trust.  In the field of culture and creative sectors, the proposal has been informed by thematic meetings, findings of independent studies, Council conclusions 4 , re solutions from the European Parliament 5 , the evaluation of the European Heritage Label action 6 and the first interim evaluation of the European Capital of Culture action for the year 2020-2033 7 , as well as recommendations made by experts from Member States in the context of the Open Method of Coordination on culture 8 . These various sources underline the persisting relevance of the Culture strand of Creative Europe while pointing at areas of improvement, in particular in connection with the d igital and green transition s and the surge of AI, working conditions of artists and cultural and creative professionals, as well as the international context.  • Impact assessment  This proposal was subject to an impact assessment. Commission services have explored several alternative policy options to address the challenges of the sectors concerned and determined which option served better the policy areas and the priorities of the Commission. The various options were mutually exclusive. One option was to continue the existing Creative Europe and CERV programmes as stand-alone programmes, while introducing some incremental improvements. A second option consisted of bringing together the programmes aimed at protecting Union values, media and culture. A third option was a full integration under a single instrument of policies covered today by CERV, Creative Europe, together with those covered by Erasmus+ and European Solidarity Corps (ESC).  Other alternatives were also considered yet discarded at an early stage. One was the discontinuation of the EU funding in the fields currently covered by CERV and Creative Europe, but it was rejected given the importance of the problems affecting the sectors concerned, the prominence given to these policies in the Political Guidelines and the assessment of the continued relevance and added value of the EU funding intervention, underpinned by the respective mid-term evaluations. The option of alternative merging of programmes (e.g. only the Media strand of Creative Europe with the CERV programme) was also abandoned at an early stage, as it would not have effectively aligned with political priorities or adequately catered for the challenges of the sectors concerned.  The main potential impacts of the three shortlisted options (continuity, full integration, and objective-based merger) were analysed across various social, economic and environmental dimensions. Where relevant, the analysis also covered costs and benefits, impacts on competitiveness and SMEs and on digitalisation, as well as their contribution to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). The three policy options were assessed based on their effectiveness, efficiency, coherence and proportionality, applying the Social Multi-Criteria Evaluation (SMCE).  The evaluation of the options and their impacts highlighted that an integration based on policy objectives (objective-based merger) would offer better potential compared to the two alternatives. It would allow for reinforced coordination, targeted flexibility, and a more impactful use of the EU budget – without sacrificing policy focus or accessibility. It would offer the optimal balance between simplification and policy relevance. It is also congruent with stakeholders’ calls, who ask for the simplification of access to funding, flexibility of resource allocation and the application of common rules. In line with the Political Guidelines, it follows a ‘funding-follows-policy’ principle, bringing together programmes aiming at protecting culture, media and Union values. It will build on the success of current programmes, best practices of the current MFF, as evidenced by evaluations, better addressing transnational and common challenges, filling funding gaps at Member States level, and enhancing coherence between internal and external policies, while enhancing synergies, efficiency and effectiveness, and reducing overlaps. It will pay due visibility to each of the policy areas included in the merged programme in full respect of the horizontal provisions detailed in Regulation (EU, Euratom) [202X/XXX, Performance Regulation] applicable to all Union programmes. It will also increase action on cross-cutting priorities and synergies affecting the societal, media and cultural and creative sectors (e.g. sectoral skills, access to finance, innovation uptake, etc.).  Based on the Better Regulation guidelines, this impact assessment report was submitted for quality scrutiny to the Regulatory Scrutiny Board (RSB). The RSB gave an opinion on the impact assessment on 13 June 2025. The RSB made a series of comments and recommendations on scope, problem definition and the use of evaluations, intervention logic and objectives, comparison of options and cost-benefit analysis, governance, coherence and future monitoring and evaluation. The impact assessment accompanying this legal proposal was reviewed in accordance with the Board’s comments.  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  The initiative will streamline EU management, governance and implementation of EU programmes to improve efficiency for applicants, beneficiaries and EU institutions. Application and reporting procedures will be simplified and further harmonised, through the introduction of common or aligned rules, making it easier for applicants to apply to calls addressing complementary policy objectives.  To simplify implementation and reduce administrative burden for beneficiaries, the use of simplified forms of funding (including financing not linked to costs and lump sums) will become the standard form of contribution for reimbursing grants. The use of financial support to third parties, which has proven efficient in making EU funding more accessible to small organisations, will also continue and could be extended where appropriate. Moreover, increasing the use of multi-annual grants will also have a positive impact. Obstacles encountered by grassroots organisations and first-time applicants will be addressed through targeted simplification measures addressing their circumstances, enhanced communication, and promotion of funding opportunities. The pooling of resources, including in areas such as monitoring, internal and external communication will bring economies of scale and enhance the predictability of EU funding more widely among beneficiaries, stakeholders and EU citizens.  • Fundamental rights  Building on the previous Creative Europe and Citizens, Equality, Rights and Values (CERV) programmes and pre-existing prerogative lines, the new instrument aims at promoting Union values, including respect for fundamental rights, equality, democracy, as well as culture and media.  It is in line with and promotes the values set out in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union. The objectives of the new Programme are closely linked to the promotion of fundamental rights and are thus in line with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU. In particular, this proposal will contribute to the promotion and protection of the rights and principles enshrined in Articles 8 (protection of personal data), 11 (freedom of expression, right s to information, media freedom and pluralism), 12 (freedom of assembly and of association), 13 (freedom of the arts and science), 15 (freedom to choose an occupation and right to engage in work), 20 and 21 (equality and non-discrimination), 22 (cultural and linguistic diversity), 23 (equality between women and men), 24 (rights of the child), 26 (rights of persons with disabilities), 31 (fair and just working conditions), 32 (prohibition of child labour and protection of young people at work), 33 (family and professional life), 39 to 46 (citizens’ rights) of the Charter.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  see Annex  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  This initiative will be monitored through the performance framework for the 2028-2034 budget defined in Regulation (EU) [XXX]* of the European Parliament and of the Council [Performance], which also details the specific rules regarding evaluations. The evaluation shall be conducted in accordance with the Commission's Better Regulation Guidelines and will be based on indicators relevant to the objectives of the Programme.  A part of the Programme will be implemented by an Executive Agency under the supervision of the Commission services responsible for the Programme.  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  The general objectives of the Programme are to promote cultural and linguistic diversity and heritage, to increase the competitiveness of the cultural and creative sectors, in particular the media and audiovisual industries, to safeguard artistic and media freedom, and to protect and promote equality, active citizenship, rights and values as enshrined in the Treaties and in the Charter, thereby enhancing democratic participation and societal resilience within the Union.  Within this general objective, the Programme shall have three separate strands:  First, the ‘Creative Europe – Culture’ strand, which will implement the following specific objective:  (a) Contribute to cross-border cultural creation, cooperation, participation and accessibility, and cross-border circulation of a diversity of cultural works, while strengthening the social, economic and international dimensions of the cultural and creative sectors .  Second, the ‘MEDIA+’ strand, which will implement the following specific objectives:  (a) Contribute to the cultural diversity and competitiveness of the audiovisual and video games industries, notably by enhancing creation and cross-border distribution of European content and its access by citizens .  (b) Contribute to a free, viable and diverse Union information ecosystem, notably by supporting free and independent journalism and news media, enhancing citizens’ access to trustworthy information and tackling disinformation .  Third, the Democracy, Citizens, Equality, Rights and Values (‘CERV+’) strand, which will implement the following specific objectives:  (a) Contribute to protecting and promoting fundamental rights, equality and non-discrimination and Union citizen s ’ rights enshrined in the Treaties including free movement of citizens, and empower ing civil society .  (b) Contribute to fighting against gender-based violence, violence against children and other groups at risk of such violence .  (c) Contribute to enhancing democratic participation and upholding the rule of law .  To maximise impact and enhance synergies across the strands, the Programme shall support cross-cutting and horizontal activities contributing to the general objective, notably by developing synergies between the cultural, media and civic spheres and promoting cross-sectoral collaboration and innovation .  To be effective, the Programme should take into account the specific nature of the different policies, their different target groups and their particular needs through targeted approaches.  2025/0550 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  establishing the 'AgoraEU' programme for the period 2028-2034, and repealing Regulations (EU) 2021/692 and (EU) 2021/818  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article s 19(2), 21(2), 24, 167(5), 168(5) and 173(3) thereof ,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 9 ,  Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions 10 ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure  Whereas:  (1) Pursuant to Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU), the Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and the respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities, which are common to the Member States in a society in which pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail (‘Union values’) . The Union values are reflected in the rights, freedoms and principles set out in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the ‘Charter’). Article 3 TEU further mandates the Union to promote the protection of the rights of the child. Article 10 TEU further states that the functioning of the Union shall be founded on representative democracy, that citizens are directly represented at Union level in the European Parliament and that citizens have the right to participate in the democratic life of the Union. Article 20 establishes Union citizenship and sets out important rights that c itizens of the Union shall , inter alia, enjoy .  (2) Culture and media and promotion and respect of Union values are all crucial components of a free, fair, diverse, inclusive and cohesive Union. Citizens’ participation and engagement, in due respect of Union values, constitutes the basis of the democratic life of the Union, with media playing a crucial role in shaping public opinion and free debate. Audiovisual works and all other forms of cultural and creative expressions, including cultural heritage, are essential to Europe’s diversity and to forg ing societal resilience and mutual understandin g among European citizens and communities .  (3) The ‘ Agora EU ’ Programme (the ‘Programme’) will provide a significant contribution to the attainment and realisation of these objectives, rights and values.  (4) The Programme should succeed the Creative Europe Programme established by Regulation (EU) 2021/818 of the European Parliament and the Council 11 and the Citizens, Equality, Rights and Values Programme, established by Regulation (EU) 2021/692 of the European Parliament and of the Council 12 . It should streamline various funding actions in support of media freedom and pluralism, fight against disinformation in support of the provision on information on Union affairs. Free and pluralistic media and civil society are among key watchdogs of the Union’s democratic systems, playing a crucial role for democratic resilience, and should be supported. The Programme should also support the cultural, creative and media sectors, harness the power of culture and cultural diversity, enhance the information space, and support the Union’s efforts to strengthen a rights-based, inclusive, equal and democratic society. This Regulation lays down an indicative financial envelope for the ‘ Agora EU ’ Programme 13 . For the purpose of this Regulation, current prices are calculated by applying a fixed 2% deflator.  (5) To be effective, the Programme should take into account the specific nature and challenges of the different policy areas and sectors , their different target groups and their particular needs through targeted approaches.  (6) In a fast changing economic, social and geopolitical environment, the recent experience has shown the need for a more flexible multiannual financial framework and its programmes. To that effect, and in line with the objectives of the ‘ Agora EU ’ Programme, the funding will take due account of the evolving policy needs and Union’s priorities as identified in relevant documents published by the Commission, in Council conclusions and European Parliament resolutions while ensuring sufficient predictability for the implementatio n .  (7) The cultural and creative sectors , including performing arts (such as theatre and dance), literature and book publishing, music, visual arts, tangible and intangible cultural heritage, architecture, archives, libraries and museums, crafts and design (including fashion design), serve as ‘ public good ’ , generating meaning and embodying the values of the Union . They are also a great asset for the Union and its regions , attracting sustainable tourism and projecting the image of a dynamic continent on the world stage. The Programme should take into account , on the one hand, their intrinsic and artistic value , as well as , on the other hand, their extrinsic social and economic contributions, including to social and territorial cohesion, well-being and health, growth and job creation , competitiveness , creativity and innovation.  (8) The cultur al and creative sectors are however fragmented along national and linguistic lines in the Union . They also face multiple challenges, such as attacks on freedom of artistic expression, precarious working conditions, digital transformations with the rise of artificial intelligence, and the need to adapt to climate change. The Programme should help th ose sectors respond to such challenges, untap their full potential and project themselves resolutely into the future while ensuring the widest participation , including from local and regional actors , through various channels and formats .  (9) Europe's cultural heritage is a shared and priceless legacy facing budget constraints, natural and human-induced disasters, climate change, and regional conflicts. It is important to safeguard and preserve such a legacy, enhancing access and fostering a collective European identity. Digital preservation further ensures that future generations can learn from, appreciate, and draw inspiration from their cultural heritage.  (10) The Programme should also give financial support to the European Heritage Label and the European Capitals of Culture actions, that celebrate and preserve Europe's rich cultural diversity and heritage , connecting it to the local level and contribut ing to culture-driven development strategies.  (11) Europe's media sectors hold a unique position in our democracies, culture, and economies. They encompass, inter alia, content such as films, series, video games, news and information, immersive reality and multimedia, as well as services including theatrical exhibition, television and radio broadcasting, print and online publishing, advertising online videos and podcasts. The digital transformation, notably the rise of artificial intelligence, has accelerated media convergence, changed consumer behaviour, disrupted business and revenue models, as well as intellectual property management and exploitation. The Union should therefore help the Union’s media thrive, foster innovation and access to finance, promot e cross fertilisation between news, audi o visual and other media sectors and support collaborations between different types of media entities a cross the Union.  (12) The Union audiovisual sector face s challenges stemming from limited cross-border circulation, shifting consumption habits and the dominance of non- Union players. Given these challenges, Union intervention should support the capacity of European audiovisual and video games industries to create, finance, produce and disseminate European works on all platforms that are available and attractive to audiences within the Union and beyond. It should foster transmedia adaptations of intellectual property between different media formats, contribute to promoting collaboration among Member States with different market capacities, and accompany the Union’s audiovisual regulatory framework.  (13) News media outlets and journalists across the Union are under increased pressure , notably due to the rise of global online platforms, shifting consumption habits and growing spread of disinformation . These challenges impact news revenues and distribution, undermining the viability and public trust in news media outlets, and limiting citizens’ access to diverse, professionally produced European journalistic content. The Union should support a viable, independent and diverse information ecosystem, protect journalists under threat, promote media freedom and pluralism, and reinforce the integrity of the information space, by promoting measures and enhancing cooperation aimed at tackling disinformation and supporting digital and media literacy , including for young people .  (14) Democracies in the Union are facing increasing challenges. Declining trust of citizens in democratic institutions and processes is exacerbated by disinformation, social polarisation and hatred impacting the electoral and other democratic processes. A whole of society approach is needed to make European democracy more resilient .  (15) The protection and promotion of fundamental rights contributes to the construction of a more democratic Union. Non-discrimination is a core principle of the Union enshrined in Article 19 TFEU and in Article 21 of the Charter . Working towards an equal and discrimination-free society contributes to untap ping the potential of individuals in their diversity and to cultural, economic and social growth. It also helps to address important root causes of violence against vulnerable groups , which in turn is a frontal attack on equality . The refore, the Programme should promote actions to address all forms of discrimination and intolerance, namely direct and indirect discrimination, paying attention to the specific forms of structural and intersectional discrimination, with a view to support ing relevant Union policy frameworks. The Programme should support actions to prevent and combat all forms of xenophobia and racism, antisemitism and anti- M uslim hatred, homophobia, biphobia, transphobia, interphobia , intolerance and discrimination based on gender identity, intolerance towards persons belonging to minorities including Roma, as well as hate speech. The Programme should also contribute to enabl ing the Union to deliver on the commitment taken as Party to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities adopted on 13 December 2006 14 to promote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities.  (16) The rights to privacy and the protection of personal data, enshrined respectively in Article 7 of the Charter and in Article 16 TFEU and Article 8 of the Charter, are enforced through a dedicated Regulation 15 and Directive 16 . The Union ’ s legal framework lay s down provisions to ensure that the right to protection of personal data is effectively protected. These legal instruments entrust the national data protection supervisory authorities with the task of promoting public awareness and understanding the risks, rules, safeguards and rights in relation to the processing of personal data. The Programme should contribute to rais ing awareness, carry out studies and other relevant activities in this field , including through the national data protection supervisory authorities , given the importance of the right to the protection of personal data in times of rapid technological developments.  (17) Gender equality is a fundamental right and an objective of the Union and should be supported by the P rogramme. Despite many achievements, significant challenges remain, which require to reinforce the Union’s commitment. This include s working towards freedom from gender-based violence, the highest standards of health, including in particular sexual and reproductive health, equal pay and economic empowerment, work-life balance and care, equal employment, career opportunities and working conditions, quality and inclusive education, political participation and equal representation, institutional mechanisms that deliver on women’s rights, actively tackling gender stereotypes and addressing intersectional discrimination.  (18) Gender-based violence and violence against women, children, young persons and other groups at risk, such as LGBTIQ persons and persons with disabilities, constitute a serious violation of fundamental rights and continue to persist throughout the Union, in all social and economic contexts. Violence against women and persons belonging to other groups at risk is a violation of human rights and a frontal attack on equality . Thus, preventing and addressing such violence is a societal imperative and contributes to tackling such discrimination as well as addressing the impacts of violence, including on health. At the same time, ensuring a discrimination-free society will also help address the root causes of violence against vulnerable groups , since they are intrinsically linked. The refore , the Programme should continue the longstanding Union effort in preventing, responding to and fighting violence at all levels as well as in protecting and supporting all direct and indirect victims and survivors of violence, building on the five consecutive generations of the Daphne programme and strand 17 . The Programme should support the achievement of the objectives of the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women adopted in Istanbul on 11 May 2011 , the implementation of the Commission Recommendation on developing and strengthening integrated child protection systems in the best interests of the child 18 , which protects children from any form of violence , as well as contribute to enabl ing the Union to deliver on the commitment taken as Party to the U N Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities , which protect s persons with disabilities against any form of exploitation, violence and abuse .  (19) In accordance with Union a c quis on equal treatment, the Member States have set up independent bodies for the promotion of equal treatment (‘equality bodies’), which play a key role in promoting equality and ensuring the effective application of equal treatment legislation. Further, the Programme should support t he European Network of Equality Bodies (Equinet) composed of the national equality bodies as provided for by Council Directive (EU) 2024/1499 19 and Directive (EU) 2024/1500 of the European Parliament and of the Council 20 , s ince Equinet is the only entity which ensures coordination of activities between equality bodies . This is of key importance for the effective implementation of Union anti-discrimination law in the Member States.  (20) Citizens throughout the Union, many of whom regularly or at least occasionally travel to, live, study, work or volunteer in another Member State, should feel able to enjoy and exercise their citizenship rights and to place their trust in equal access, full enforceability and protection of their rights without any discrimination, no matter where in the Union they happen to be. Citizens should be more aware of their rights deriving from citizenship of the Union, namely their right to move and reside freely in the Union, their voting rights when residing in another Member State , their right to petition the European Parliament in any of the official languages, their right to submit citizens' initiatives and their right to lodge complaints with the European o mbudsman against institutional maladministration.  (21) Encouraging citizens to play a more active role in democracy at Union level will strengthen European civil society and foster the development of a European identity. Civil society therefore needs to be supported in promoting, safeguarding and raising awareness of Union values and in contributing to the effective enjoyment of rights under Union law. When Union citizens participate in the democratic life of the Union, they contribute to making a reality representative democracy, a principle on which the functioning of the Union is founded and which gives concrete expression to the value of democracy enshrined in Article 2 TEU.  (22) In order to bring the Union closer to its citizens and to foster democratic participation, a variety of actions and coordinated efforts are necessary. European citizenship and European identity should be developed and advanced by encouraging citizens’ understanding of the policy-making process, and by promoting civic engagement in the actions of the Union. Remembrance activities and critical reflection on Europe’s historical memory are necessary to make citizens aware of the common history, and to lay the foundation for a common future and shared values. Furthermore, supporting civil society organisations at local, regional, national and transnational level in the areas covered by the Programme will contribute to increasing citizens’ engagement in society and ultimately to their active involvement in the democratic life of the Union. At the same time, supporting activities that promote mutual understanding, intercultural dialogue, cultural and linguistic diversity, social inclusion and respect for others fosters a sense of belonging to the Union and of a common citizenship under a European identity, based on a shared understanding of our common European values, culture, history and heritage.  (23) C ivil society organisations , and other civic space actors, such as independent h uman r ights bodies, e quality b odies and Ombudspersons Institutions, play a vital role in contributing to the implementation of policy, encouraging people’s participation, holding institutions accountable, and driving positive change. The Programme should help ensure sufficient resources and an enabling environment for them to operate independently, freely , safely, and effectively. To this end, Union funding should complement efforts at national level by supporting, protecting, empowering and building their capacity, as emphasi s ed in the European Parliament resolution of 19 April 2018 21 , as well as Council conclusions of 10 March 2023 22 and 7 March 2025 23 . Civil society also plays an important role in ensuring an effective implementation of Directive (EU) 2019/1937 of the European Parliament and of the Council 24 by fostering a speak-up culture and a favourable environment for whistleblowers.  (24) The Court of Justice of the European Union has confirmed that the Union is a legal structure that is based on the fundamental premis e that each Member State shares with all the other Member States, and recognises that they share with it, the common values contained in Article 2 TEU, on which the Union is founded 25 . That premis e is based on the specific and essential characteristics of Union law, including the autonomy it enjoys in relation to the laws of the Member States and to international law. That premis e implies and justifies the existence of mutual trust between the Member States that those values will be recognised and, therefore, that the Union law that implements them will be respected . It follows that compliance by a Member State with the values contained in Article 2 TEU is a condition for the enjoyment of all the rights deriving from the application of the Treaties to that Member State . The Court of Justice of the European Union has therefore confirmed that in the areas for which the Union is competent, it can take action to ensure respect for the values set out in Article 2 TEU .  (25) At a time when European societies face challenges that affect democracies , such as raise of extremisms and intolerance , disinformation and foreign information manipulation and interference by hostile actors, it is crucial that Union values such as respect for fundamental rights , equality and democracy, continue to be actively cultivated, protected, promoted, enforced, and shared among citizens and peoples, so that those values remain at the heart of the Union project. A deterioration in their protection in any Member State can have detrimental effects on the Union as a whole. It is therefore crucial that this Programme contributes to protecting Union values, including respect for fundamental rights, equality and democracy.  (26) In light of increasing risks linked to natural hazards, climate and environmental disasters, health emergencies, technological accidents, evolving security threats, and other disruptions, it is essential to enhance the Union’s and Member States’ capability to anticipate, prepare for, and respond to crises . The Programme should therefore support citizens’ education and engagement on crisis preparedness thus enhancing societal resilience .  (27) Hence, the Programme should also support actions aiming at safeguarding and strengthening democracy in the Union, reinforcing public trust in democracy and democratic institutions, strengthening democratic preparedness and resilience, fostering citizens’ engagement, participation and awareness of common history and values, thereby supporting citizens’ exercise of their rights, including their electoral rights, in full respect of Member States’ competences in the organisation of elections. The Programme should also contribute to foster ing critical thinking, civic participation and democracy through education as a lifelong effort, so that all citizens have the skills to recognise foreign information, manipulation and interference and disinformation .  (28) The Programme should foster synergies and complementarity with Global Europe as it will contribute to the advancement of the Union’s international cultural relations and to the Union ’s external action objectives through cultural cooperation .  (29) The Programme should also support the financing of technical and organisational support for the implementation of Regulation (EU)2019/788 of the European Parliament and of the Council 26 , thereby underpinning the exercise by citizens of the right to launch and support European citizens’ initiatives. Together with the other rights set out in Article 24 TFEU, that right ensures citizens’ direct participation in the democratic life of the Union .  (30) To ensure consistency, the budgetary guarantee and financial instruments under the Programme, including when combined with other forms of non-repayable support in blending operations, should be implemented in accordance with the applicable rules of the European Competitiveness Fund ( ECF) InvestEU Instrument through agreements concluded for that type of support under the ECF Invest EU Instrument.  (31) Where Union support under the Programme is to be provided in the form of a budgetary guarantee or a financial instrument, including where combined with non-repayable support in a blending operation, it is necessary that such support is provided exclusively through the ECF InvestEU Instrument in accordance with the applicable rules of the ECF InvestEU Instrument.  (32) The Commission should be able to divide budgetary commitments into annual instalments. In that case, the Commission should commit the annual instalments during the implementation of the Programme, taking into account the progress of the actions that receive financial assistance, their estimated needs and the budget available.  (33) Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 of the European Parliament and of the Council 27 applies to the Programme. It lays down the rules on the establishment and the implementation of the general budget of the Union, including the rules on grants, prizes, non-financial donations, procurement, indirect implementation, financial assistance, financial instruments and budgetary guarantees.  (34) In accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509, Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council 28 , Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2988/95 29 , Council Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 30 and Council Regulation (EU) 2017/1939 31 , the financial interests of the Union are to be protected through proportionate measures, including the prevention, detection, correction and investigation of irregularities and fraud, the recovery of funds lost, wrongly paid or incorrectly used and, where appropriate, the imposition of administrative sanctions. In particular, in accordance with Regulations (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 and (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96, the European Anti-Fraud Office (‘OLAF’) may carry out investigations, including on-the-spot checks and inspections, with a view to establishing whether there has been fraud, corruption or any other illegal activity affecting the financial interests of the Union. In accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017/1939, the European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO) may investigate and prosecute fraud and other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Union as provided for in Directive (EU) 2017/1371 of the European Parliament and of the Council 32 . In accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509, any person or entity receiving Union funds is to fully cooperate in the protection of the Union’s financial interests, to grant the necessary rights and access to the Commission, OLAF, EPPO and the European Court of Auditors and to ensure that any third parties involved in the implementation of Union funds grant equivalent rights.  (35) The Programme is to be implemented in accordance with Regulation (EU) [XXX]* of the European Parliament and of the Council [Performance] which establishes the rules for the expenditure tracking and the performance framework for the budget, including rules for ensuring a uniform application of the principles of ‘do no significant harm’ and gender equality referred to in Article 33(2), points (d) and (f), of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 respectively, rules for monitoring and reporting on the performance of Union programmes and activities, rules for establishing a Union funding portal, rules for the evaluation of the programmes, as well as other horizontal provisions applicable to all Union programmes such as those on information, communication and visibility , while taking into account the scope and nature of the activities and priorities .  (36) The Programme should also support the role of Programme Desks, which Member States have the possibility to establish, and which should provid e guidance and assistance to applicants on funding opportunities and cross-border collaborations, contributing to the Programme’s outreach visibility and dissemination in accordance with Regulation (EU) [XXX]* of the European Parliament and of the Council [Performance] . Programme Desks should carry out their functions independently and without interference from public authorities in their decision making, and ought not to have any responsibility regarding the management of the programme 33 .  (37) Pursuant to Article 85(1) of Council Decision (EU) 2021/1764 34 , persons and entities established in overseas countries and territories are eligible for funding subject to the ruled objectives of the Programme and possible arrangements applicable to the Member State to which the relevant overseas country or territory is linked.  (38) Participation of third countries in the ‘Audiovisual’ specific objective requires a certain level of reciprocity and regulatory alignment. For this reason, the situation of their audiovisual markets, the proximity of their legal frameworks with the Union audiovisual media acquis, in particular Directive 2010/13/EU, and the access to their support schemes should be taken into consideration when concluding Association Agreements. This is of particular importance concerning other European countries, whose audiovisual works benefit from the provisions of Directive 2010/13/EU that promote European works, notably the quotas system. In the specific case of acceding countries, candidate countries and potential candidates, the requirement to align their national legislations with Directive 2010/13/EU was already included in Regulation (EU) 2021/818 establishing the Creative Europe Programme. This condition has been an efficient incentive to accelerate their work on the overall alignment with the EU acquis in view of accession.  (39) Since the objectives of this Regulation cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the transnational nature of the challenges, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, as set out in Article 5 TEU . In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.  (40) This Regulation establishes the Programme for 2028 to 2034, which succeeds to the Programmes established by Regulations (EU) 2021/692 and (EU) 2021/818 for 2021 to 2027. Regulations (EU) 2021/692 and (EU) 2021/818 should therefore be repealed ,  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Chapter I  General provisions  Article 1  Subject matter  This Regulation establishes the ‘AgoraEU’ Programme (the ‘Programme’) and lays down the objectives of the Programme, its budget for the period 2028-2034, the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding.  Article 2  Definitions  For the purposes of this Regulation, the following definition applies:  ‘award procedure’ means an award procedure, as defined in Article 2, point (3), of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509, as well as procedures for entrusting the implementation and provision of support through financial instruments, for granting the budgetary guarantee, or for providing support under the budgetary guarantee.

Chapter VI  Financial provisions  Article 11  Budget  1. The indicative financial envelope for the implementation of the Programme for the period 2028-203 4 is set at EUR 8 582 000 000 in current prices.  2. Budgetary commitments for activities extending over more than one financial year may be broken down over several years into annual instalments.  3. Appropriations may be entered in the Union budget beyond 2034 to cover the expenses necessary and to enable the management of actions not completed by the end of the Programme.  4. The financial envelope referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article and the amounts of additional resources referred to in Article 1 2 may also be used for technical and administrative assistance for the implementation of the Programme, such as preparatory, monitoring, control, audit and evaluation activities, corporate information technology systems and platforms, information and communication activities, including corporate communication on the political priorities of the Union, and all other technical and administrative assistance or staff-related expenses incurred by the Commission for the management of the Programme.  Article 12  Additional resources  1. Member States, Union institutions, bodies and agencies, third countries, international organisations, international financial institutions, or other third parties, may make additional financial or non-financial contributions to the Programme. Additional financial contributions shall constitute external assigned revenue within the meaning of Article 21(2), points (a), (d), or (e), or Article 21(5) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509.  2. Resources allocated to Member States under shared management may, at their request, be made available to the Programme. The Commission shall implement those resources directly or indirectly in accordance with Article 62(1), point (a) or (c), of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509. They shall be additional to the amount referred to in Article 11 (1) of this Regulation. Those resources shall be used for the benefit of the Member State concerned. Where the Commission has not entered into a legal commitment under direct or indirect management for additional amounts thus made available to the Programme, the corresponding uncommitted amounts may, at the request of the Member State concerned, be transferred back to one or more respective source programmes or their successors.  Article 13  Alternative, combined and cumulative funding  1. The Programme shall be implemented in synergy with other Union programmes. An action that has received Union contribution from another programme may also receive a contribution under this Programme. The rules of the relevant Union programme shall apply to the corresponding contribution, or a single set of rules may be applied to all contributions and a single legal commitment may be concluded. If all Union contributions are provided based on eligible cost, the cumulative support from the Union budget shall not exceed the total eligible costs of the action and may be calculated on a pro-rata basis in accordance with the documents setting out the conditions for support.  2.

FRAMEWORK OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE  1.1. Title of the proposal/initiative  Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council establishing the ‘AgoraEU’ Programme and repealing regulations (EU) No 2021/692 and No 2021/818 for the period 2028-2034  1.2. Policy area(s) concerned  Culture, audiovisual and media, fundamental rights, equality and non-discrimination, the rule of law, civil society, democratic participation.  1.3. Objective(s)  1.3.1. General objective(s)  The general objectives of the Programme are to promote cultural and linguistic diversity and heritage, to increase the competitiveness of the cultural and creative sectors, in particular the media and audiovisual industries, to safeguard artistic and media freedom, and to protect and promote equality, active citizenship, rights and values as enshrined in the Treaties and in the Charter, thereby enhancing democratic participation and societal resilience within the Union.  1.3.2. Specific objective(s)  The Programme will underpin the following specific objectives:  a) contribute to cross-border cultural creation, cooperation, participation and accessibility, and cross-border circulation of a diversity of cultural works, while strengthening the social, economic and international dimensions of the cultural and creative sectors (‘culture’);  b) contribute to the cultural diversity and competitiveness of the audiovisual and video games industries, notably by enhancing creation and cross-border distribution of European content and its access by citizens (‘audiovisual’);  c) contribute to a free, viable and diverse Union information ecosystem, notably by supporting free and independent journalism and news media, enhancing citizens’ access to trustworthy information and tackling disinformation (‘news’);  d) contribute to protecting and promoting fundamental rights, equality and non-discrimination and Union citizen’s rights enshrined in the Treaties including free movement of citizens, and empowering civil society (‘rights, equality, citizens and civil society’).  e) contribute to fighting against gender-based violence, violence against children and other groups at risk of such violence (‘Daphne’).  f) contribute to enhancing democratic participation and upholding the rule of law (‘democratic participation and rule of law’).  To maximise impact and enhance synergies, the Programme shall support cross-cutting and horizontal activities contributing to the general objectives, notably by developing synergies between the cultural, media and civic spheres and promoting cross-sectoral collaboration and innovation.  1.3.3. Expected result(s) and impact  Specify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.  The Programme will have positive impact on cross-border cultural cooperation, cultural participation and accessibility, and circulation of diverse cultural works. This will come through promotion of cooperation, creation, networking and pooling of experience in the cultural and creative sectors (CCS), support of circulation of diverse cultural content and access to cultural diversity and heritage, and support of mobility of artists and CCS professionals beyond national borders. Actions will result in, among others, better equipped CCS to address key challenges, reinforced CCS creative potential in respect of artistic freedom, a more diverse cultural content circulating beyond national borders, more artists and CCS professionals expanding their careers, increased and more inclusive access to more diverse cultural content and heritage, increased international cultural partnerships and exchanges, increased digitisation, access, preservation and reuse of digital heritage.  The Programme will have positive impact on supporting the creation, circulation and access of EU audiovisual and media content, and a diverse information market. Support to audiovisual works will contribute to strengthening European cultural diversity and competitiveness, through e.g. co-productions. It will bring improvements as well in the creation, circulation and access to video games content, and foster cross-media IP exploitation. The integrity of the EU information market will be protected through support to media pluralism and independence, media viability and media literacy, and by strengthening situational awareness.  The Programme will have positive impact on the protection and promotion of fundamental rights and non-discrimination, as well as on a thriving civic space. Actions will have the effect to increase the visibility and awareness of fundamental rights, reduce discrimination and harassment. Actions will also have the effect to protect individuals, and particularly women, children and groups at risk from violence and to support victims in addressing its consequences. Citizens and organisations will be able to participate meaningfully in the political, economic, social and cultural life of their societies. Citizens will be able to freely express their views, choose their political leaders, and have a say about their future.  1.3.4. Indicators of performance  Specify the indicators for monitoring progress and achievements.  The output and result indicators for the purpose of monitoring progress and achievements of this programme will correspond to the common indicators provided under Regulation (EU) [XXX]* of the European Parliament and of the Council [Performance].  1.4. The proposal/initiative relates to:  ¨ a new action  ¨ a new action following a pilot project / preparatory action 38  ☒ the extension of an existing action  ¨ a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action  1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative  1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative  The Programme will contribute to tackling specific and common challenges and fostering synergies in the culture, media, and civic spheres while taking into account the specific nature and challenges of the different policy areas, their different target groups and their particular needs. By bringing together support in these areas, the Union will be better equipped to address recurrent but also new and emerging policy priorities, such as protecting democracies, rights and equality, fostering an enabling space for civil society, contributing to cultural and linguistic diversity and to the protection of cultural heritage, strengthening the cultural and creative sectors and increasing their resilience, promoting media freedom and pluralism, and enhancing the economic growth of the media and cultural players.  1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, great er effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this section 'added value of EU involvement' is the value resulting from EU action, that is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.  Reasons for action at EU level (ex-ante)  Funding covered by the programme concentrates on activities where the EU intervention can bring additional value compared to action of Member States alone.  In particular:  - Addressing transnational and common challenges (e.g., shrinking civic spaces, threats to media freedom and pluralism, fragmentation of the cultural, creative and media sectors along national and linguistic borders): these challenges makes it difficult for Member States to address them sufficiently on their own. EU level efforts enable cooperation, capacity building, mutual learning and the pooling of resources, sharing of expertise and best practices.  - National-level funding and policies alone are insufficient to protect and promote EU values and democratic standards, and to safeguard the civic space. This also applies to the overall competitiveness and diversity of the media, audiovisual and other cultural and creative sectors.  - EU support is essential to maintain access to audiovisual and cultural content across all Member States and a high level of protection of fundamental rights.  - EU support fill funding and service gaps not covered at Member State level.  - EU action is critical to promote Union values at international level, implementing international standards coherently with internal policies.  Expected generated  EU added value (ex-post)  - EU-level action will enable transnational cooperation, pooling of resources, and exchange of best practices across Member States, leading to more coherent and impactful responses to shared challenges.  - EU support will complement national measures by supporting areas underfunded or deprioritized nationally.  - EU action will enhance mobility of professionals and circulation, reinforcing the functioning of the internal market and cultural and linguistic diversity.  - EU-level actions will raise awareness of rights and nurture a sense of EU citizenship and mutual understanding, through the greater awareness and appreciation of cultural diversity, the protection and promotion of Union values, supporting democratic and societal resilience, and a trustworthy information space, objectives that national interventions alone cannot fully achieve.  - EU support will foster cross border access to media, audiovisual and other cultural and creative content to European citizens.  1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past  The results of the mid-term evaluations for the period 2021-2027 indicate that the existing programmes have largely delivered on their policy objectives and provided EU added value, while highlighting areas for improvement in terms of design. For example, the interim evaluation of the Citizens, Equality, Rights and Values (CERV) programme confirmed that the programme occupies a largely empty space in the values and fundamental rights funding landscape. Creative Europe has contributed to support cultural and linguistic diversity by increasing people’s access to diverse European content as well as to help audiovisual and other creative and cultural operators to scale up at European level and become more competitive. The evaluation on Multimedia Actions equally confirmed the added value of supporting independent news coverage on EU affairs.  The evaluations also point to areas of improvement in terms of design. These include expanding the reach of the programmes, easing access, simplifying management, enhancing monitoring, strengthening synergies and avoiding overlaps with other programmes, and increasing flexibility to address new challenges.  1.5.4. Compatibility with the multiannual financial framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments  The initiative is part of the 2028-2034 multiannual financial framework proposal.  The initiative is aligned with the overarching Commission’s 2024-2029 policy priorities, namely in terms of 1) Supporting people, strengthening our societies and our social model; 2) Protecting our democracy, upholding our values; 3) Europe’s sustainable prosperity and competitiveness; and 4) a global Europe.  1) Synergies with policies supporting people, strengthening our societies and our social model  Synergies will be fostered between media, culture, values and rights initiatives and the future intervention in the fields of education, solidarity and youth. These synergies, such as in media literacy, digital skills, civic engagement and civic education, arts and culture education, and skills development and inclusion, will be promoted in line with the objectives of the European Youth Strategy and the EU Citizenship Report as well as other upcoming policy initiatives. The initiative complements some initiatives under employment and social policies. Promoting equal access to rights and fostering diversity will support social inclusion and fair labour markets. The cultural and creative sectors and media industries will actively contribute to the upskilling and reskilling of professionals, in the context of the Union of Skills, likewise, it will likely favour the creation of jobs in these sectors. The cultural and creative sectors will also focus on improving working conditions of artists and of cultural and creative professionals.  2) Synergies with justice policies  The alignment between justice policies and the rule of law creates a robust framework that ensures accountability, promotes legal coherence across Member States, and protects fundamental rights, thereby enhancing trust and cooperation within the Union. The relationship between fundamental rights and justice policies is key in shaping fair and equitable societies. Fundamental rights – ranging from the right to a fair trial, freedom from discrimination to the protection of privacy – define the essential standards that justice systems must uphold, and translate abstract principles into concrete legal measures and practices. For instance, anti-discrimination laws enforce the principle of equality before the law. Thus, the synergy between fundamental rights and justice policies ensures that legal systems not only prevent abuses but actively promote dignity, equality, and freedom. This synergy is essential for building public trust in legal institutions, fostering social cohesion, and ultimately ensuring that justice is accessible and meaningful for all individuals. To this end, synergies will be fostered between this programme and the future Justice programme.  3) Synergies with policies for the Single Market and competitiveness  The initiative will complement the EU policy framework on Single Market and economic competitiveness. Notably, it builds on the 2024 Single Market and Competitiveness Report, which adopts an ecosystem-based approach to strengthen the resilience and strategic autonomy of key industrial sectors, including cultural and creative industries. It also reflects the objectives of the Competitiveness Compass, which sets out clear benchmarks to improve the EU’s long-term productivity and promote innovation.  The initiative will strengthen synergies with the future European Competitiveness Fund and the future programme for research and innovation. This includes support for multidisciplinary research in a variety of topics including democracy, values, equality, and disinformation, but also on digital and industrial topics closely linked to the cultural and creative sectors (e.g., extended reality, immersive environments, new media). Moreover, the proposal contributes to addressing Europe’s digital transformation, in line with the objectives of the Digital Decade 2030.  4) Synergies with policies for a global Europe  The future programme will complement actions financed through the Union external actions. For instance, by promoting cultural exchanges and supporting EU media and audiovisual content globally including through   international collaborations, it will open new markets, attract global talent, enhance the EU’s influence and attractiveness on the world stage.  1.5.5.

Comments  The programme will be implemented under direct management (with parts delegated to the European Education and Culture Executive Agency) as well as under indirect management through International organisations (e.g. UNESCO, OECD, CoE,...) and other Pillar assessed bodies, which has proven to be successful in previous Multiannual Financial Frameworks (MFFs).  2. MANAGEMENT MEASURES  2.1. Monitoring and reporting rules  (41) The monitoring and reporting rules for this programme will follow the requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) [XXX]* of the European Parliament and of the Council [ Pe rformance] .  2.2. Management and control system(s)  2.2.1. Justification of the budget implementation method(s), the funding implementation mechanism(s), the payment modalities and the control strategy proposed  The majority of the Programme's actions will be implemented under direct management mode, and partly delegated to the European Education and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA). The current implementing mode has proven effective in the precedessor programmes, and the error rates are currently less than 2% for the Creative Europe programme, based on preliminary results for the current MFF. Funding will be implemented using the implementation modes offered by the Financial Regulation, mainly grants and procurement, as this allows to better adapt the actions to the needs of the policy and to have more flexibility to re-adjust priorities in particular through grants. Grants will be in the form of actual costs, lump sums, flat rates, unit costs or a combination of these. The use of scales of units costs and other simplified measures will reduce the scope for error in cost claims. Several measures to allow better access for example for smaller organisations, simplification of guidelines and procedures on the basis of the Financial Regulation will be applied (see above).  Direct management by the Commission will also allow to establish direct contacts with the beneficiaries/contractors engaged in the implementation of activities that serve Union policies.  2.2.2. Information concerning the risks identified and the internal control system(s) set up to mitigate them  The Programme faces the same risks as other Commission programmes that target beneficiaries which are diverse in nature. In particular, some beneficiaries are not recurring or do not have extensive administrative structures. Risks are mainly related to (1) ensuring quality of selected projects and their subsequent technical implementation; (2) risk of inefficient or non-economic use of funds awarded, both for grants and procurement; (3) fraud.  Most of these risks are expected to be reduced thanks to: (1) careful design of calls for proposals; (2) guidance to applicants and beneficiaries; (3) the use of the simplified cost options of unit costs, flat rates and lump sums, which have been effectively applied in the current MFF and are provided in the Financial Regulation; (4) the use of corporate procedures and systems for the management of proposals and grants (e.g. grants vademecum, e-Grants etc.) to ensure a full alignment with best practice in all stages of the grant and procurement lifecycles.  The control strategy is composed of different building blocks: (1) programming, evaluation and selection of proposals to ensure that only best proposals are funded; (2) signing and monitoring of grant agreements, subject to ex ante verification at both financial and policy level; (3) ex post audits based on a “detection strategy” aimed at identifying a maximum of anomalies in view of recovering undue payments.  Parts of the Programme will continue to be implemented by the Education and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA) which uses the same corporate procedures applied throughout the Commission.  EACEA applies an annual ex post audit plan which covers all actions, and confirms an error rate below 2% for the current MFF.  Currently, EACEA is supervised by its Steering Committee with DG EAC and DG CNECT as the parent DGs regarding the Creative Europe programme as well as DG JUST as parent DG for the CERV programme. Regular reporting via dashboards is ensured as well as regular coordination meetings with the parent DGs.  2.2.3. Estimation and justification of the cost-effectiveness of the controls (ratio between the control costs  and the value of the related funds managed), and assessment of the expected levels of risk of error (at payment & at closure)  The cost of controls of the programme amounts to approximately 6% of the payments done by the Commission. This is expected to stay stable or slightly decrease if the use of simplified cost options is further expanded. The objective for the management and control system is to maintain the expected levels of risk of error (at payment and at closure) below the materiality threshold of 2%.  2.3. Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities  The responsible services will continue to apply their Anti-Fraud Strategy – that are in line with the Commission’s Anti-Fraud Strategy (CAFS) – to ensure inter alia that their internal anti-fraud related controls are fully aligned with the CAFS and that its fraud risk management approach is geared to identify fraud risk cases and adequate responses.  Anti-fraud strategies of both EACEA and the Commission  enable fraud risk to be addressed, mainly via measures to prevent irregularity which are then escalated in the event of fraud detection. The following measures will continue to be implemented, both at the parent DGs as in EACEA: Desk monitoring, monitoring missions in accordance with a defined monitoring strategy, clear reporting requirements in the grant agreements with beneficiaries, kick-off meetings with new beneficiaries, possibility to cut grants upon non-delivery of results or non-compliance with certain funding conditions such as those linked to communication.  Beneficiaries in exclusion cases are submitted to the Early Detection and Exclusion Database (EDES) and cases are followed up with OLAF and the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO).  3.

This comprehensive programme seeks to establish a supportive framework that emphasizes inclusive governance, the promotion of fundamental rights, and the celebration of cultural diversity. Recognizing the pivotal role of media and cultural expressions in shaping public opinion, fostering societal resilience, and driving economic growth, the programme addresses significant challenges such as threats to media pluralism, declining revenues for news media, and the dominance of non-EU players in the audiovisual and video game markets. It also tackles the fragmentation of cultural and creative sectors along national lines, which hinders transnational collaboration and limits market access.

To support these objectives, the programme will introduce new budget lines within the multiannual financial framework, specifically targeting areas such as Creative Europe - Culture, MEDIA+, and CERV+ (Citizens, Equality, Rights and Values). These budget lines will see commitments increasing annually from 2028 to 2034, with a total of 8.582 billion EUR allocated for commitments over the seven-year period. The programme also includes support expenditure for AgoraEU, although specific payment figures are yet to be determined.

The communication ‘The road to the next multiannual financial framework’ 1 , sets the main priorities and principles of EU external action under the EU budget, which aims to be simpler, more focused, more flexible, with a greater impact and to deliver on EU priorities.  The international landscape has changed significantly over the last years, appearing far less predictable and stable. The impact of the current geopolitical instability on the EU and on partner countries is increasing, notably following Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, the conflicts in the Middle East, the US administration’s disengagement from external aid, the increasing risk of pandemics, the trade tensions, and the technology competition. These challenges, along with the widening gap to reach the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030, require the EU to adapt its external action financing to better serve its strategic interests and address current and future crises.  The objective of the proposed Instrument, Global Europe, is to uphold and promote the Union’s values, principles and interests worldwide to pursue the objectives and principles of the Union’s external action, as laid down in Article 3(5), Articles 8 and 21 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). Global Europe will contribute to the objectives of the EU’s external action, by promoting mutually beneficial partnerships with partner countries, contributing simultaneously to the sustainable development of partner countries and to the Union’s strategic interests. Global Europe will also allow the Union to be better positioned to address global challenges.  The proposed Instrument is based on four main guiding principles, which are further detailed in the different sections of this document.  – Simplification of the architecture of the external heading, through one main instrument for EU external action and with a horizontal P erformance R egulation 2 for the entire MFF, covering monitoring, reporting, evaluation and communication.  – Coherence of action, with increased geographisation , more focus on coherence, consistency and complementarity between internal and external programmes, as well as a stronger Team Europe approach.  – Flexibility of the instrument, preserving some of the flexibilities of NDICI-Global Europe including its general reserve (the cushion), financial flexibilities and the possibility to adopt delegated acts, and increasing them through the reduction of targets and easier budgetary transfers between and within pillars , as well as budgetary flexibilities among MFFs (below more details on architecture and on flexibilities).  – Impact of EU action, with a strengthened toolbox allowing to build comprehensive packages; with a streamlined and more efficient guarantee and blending framework, and a stronger promotion of European interests.  To further simplify, increase coherence and ensure the effectiveness of the Union's external action, Global Europe serves a wide range of policies, namely the enlargement, neighbourhood, international partnerships and humanitarian aid policies, maintaining the specificities of each policy, fostered through a broad array of tools. Through this proposal the EU will continue to deliver on the objectives of pre-accession, to engage with partner countries, including in complex settings and to provide humanitarian assistance. The proposed instrument will also provide increased economic and trade opportunities to the mutual benefit of the Union and partner countries, support sustainable development, promote human rights, gender equality and EU multilateral engagement, fight the root causes of irregular migration, forced displacement, instability climate change, and protect the environment. The general objectives of the Instrument are detailed in Article 4 of the proposed Regulation and the specific objectives are specified and detailed in Annex II.  Building on the experience of the NDICI-Global Europe that superseded eleven former Regulations, in line with the priorities set out in the communication ‘The road to the next multiannual financial framework’ and as concluded in the impact assessment accompanying this Regulation, Global Europe incorporates and builds on:  – The Regulations (EU) 2021/947 establishing Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation – Global Europe ( NDICI-Global Europe ), amending and repealing Decision No 466/2014/EU and repealing Regulation (EU) 2017/1601 and Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 480/2009;  – The Regulation (EU) 2021/1529 establishing the Instrument for Pre-Accession assistance ( IPA III );  – The Regulation (EU) 2024/792 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 February 2024 establishing the Ukraine Facility ;  – The Regulation (EU) 2024/1449 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 May 2024 on establishing the Reform and Growth Facility for the Western Balkans ;  – The Regulation (EU) 2025/535 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 March 2025 establishing the Reform and Growth Facility for the Republic of Moldova .  Given the magnitude and unpredictability of the needs, reconstruction and pre-accession assistance for Ukraine will be financed above the MFF ceilings (the so-called ‘headroom’ of the MFF) and be implemented through Global Europe. Furthermore, humanitarian aid actions will be funded under Global Europe and implemented in line with the Humanitarian A id Regulation 3 . Moreover, macro- financial assistance could be provided to countries experiencing balance of payments crises and will be funded under Global Europe. Global Europe will be the main instrument of the external heading, complemented by the association of the overseas countries and territories with the Union established by Council Decision (EU) 2021/1764 4 as well as the Common Foreign and Security Policy budget. Furthermore, the Instrument will be implemented in accordance with the horizontal P erformance Regulation , as detailed in chapter 5 ‘Other elements’ of this document.  In a global context where the Union is confronted with high geopolitical and geoeconomic competition , marked by global challenges, ranging from climate change to tensions around scarce resources, continuing migratory pressure or economic and trade disruptions, in addition to security threats and fragility, external action has to continuously and rapidly react to emerging needs, as well as to act to advance strategic priorities , in order to effectively pursue the Union’s and partners’ priorities. The Instrument is built to combine the need of predictability with the need to adjust rapidly to an evolving geopolitical context.  Coherence and complementarity of action will be ensured, enhancing the geographisation principle introduced under NDICI-Global Europe. The internal architecture of the proposed Instrument follows this principle and is composed of five geographic pillars and a global pillar , each of which is composed of a programmable and non-programmable component. The Instrument will be implemented primarily through the five geographic programmable components, complemented by the geographic non-programmable components. The global pillar will focus on global initiatives and will be complementary to the geographic pillars. The six pillars are supported by an unallocated emerging challenges and priorities cushion , to increase flexibility as well as the ability of the Union to respond to unforeseen needs and adapt its partnerships to emerging priorities, building on the experience of the European Development Funds and NDICI-Global Europe.  The recent evaluation of the external instruments (2014-2020 and 2021-2027) 5 confirmed that the external financing instruments under the current MFF are largely fit for purpose and delivering against their objectives. Nevertheless, it noted that t he changing geopolitical landscape has also exposed some architectural weaknesses in their design, in particular as regards their flexibility. On NDICI-Global Europe , the evaluation stressed that it could still better contribute to an integrated approach balancing EU interests, partnerships and values, further reconciling the objectives of the EU’s internal and external thematic policies. On IPA III, the above evaluation highlighted that the instrument's flexibility has been limited by the fact that annual planning has, through implementation, prevailed over strategic multi-annual programming . The lessons learned together with the increasing volatile geopolitical context have prompted the Commission to further simplify the architecture of the external financing instruments and provid e more flexibility . The Global Europe proposal also preserve s flexibilities already allowed under NDICI-Global Europe and IPA III, concerning carry-overs of funds Furthermore, reflows generated by financial instruments and surplus of budgetary guarantees will be available to be reused under this Instrument . Other elements enhancing flexibility are the possibility of adopting d elegated acts, already foreseen under NDICI-Global Europe and the easier budgetary transfers between and within pillars under the architecture of Global Europe . Furthermore, the proposed instrument does not include thematic targets. A target on o fficial d evelopment a ssistance spending is present in the Global Europe proposal.  •Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  As mentioned above, the Global Europe proposal serves under one instrument a wide range of policies, namely the enlargement, neighbourhood, international partnerships and humanitarian aid policies, maintaining the specificities of each policy. This proposal provides an enabling framework through which external action policies and international commitments can be implemented. The main international commitments include the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 6 , the Paris Agreement on Climate Change 7 , the Kunming - Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework 8 , the Addis Ababa Action Agenda 9 , the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015-2030) 10 , the Istanbul Convention on violence against women 11 and the Pact for the Future 12 . Within the EU, the policy framework includes the Treaty provisions on external action, association agreements, partnership and cooperation agreements, multilateral agreements to which the Union is a party , and other agreements that establish a legally binding relationship between the Union and partner countries as well as European Council conclusions, Council conclusions, summit declarations or conclusions of meetings with partner countries at the level of heads of state or government or ministers, European Parliament resolutions, communications of the Commission and joint communications with the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.  •Consistency with other Union policies  Consistency and complementarity will be ensured among the Union’s external financing instruments, in particular with Humanitarian aid (funded under Global Europe), the association of the overseas countries and territories with the Union, the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the European Peace Facility (which is financed outside the Union budget), as well as the European Instrument for International Nuclear Safety Cooperation- Decommissioning.  Global Europe will provide support aimed at credibly and effectively preparing candidate countries and potential candidates for future EU membership. The fulfilment of this ambition calls for aligning, to the extent possible, the design of pre-accession support under Global Europe with the orientations of relevant internal programmes.  Funding from Global Europe should also be used to foster the establishment of people-to-people partnerships based on common interests and intergenerational fairness and strengthen skills development, innovation and cultural diversity through cooperation in the fields of education, youth and research, in a way that is consistent with the Erasmus+ Regulation . Furthermore, in this framework, consistency and complementarity will also be ensured with trade and investment, economic cooperation, migration, security and other sectoral cooperation.  In particular, serving the new economic foreign policy and in synergy with the European Competitiveness Fund, the Instrument will enhance the Union’s competitiveness by responding to economic challenges and swiftly seize opportunities to support Union competitiveness, including via the support to the external dimension of Union internal policies. This will harness the potential of mutually beneficial partnerships for sustainable development in the Union and in partner countries alike.  Moreover, it will contribute to boost resilience and promote stability by addressing fragility in a humanitarian-development-peace nexus approach, balance of payment crises as well as post-conflict recovery and reconstruction needs.  2.LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  •Legal basis  Part Five, Title III, Chapters 1, 2 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, provides the legal framework for cooperation with partner countries.  This proposal is based on Articles 209, 212 and 322 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. It is presented by the Commission in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 294 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  •Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  The EU’s external action financing seeks to cooperate with partner countries, as well as to promote multilateral solutions to global challenges. It enables the EU to defend its interests, to promote its values and standards, to support the objectives of its internal policies, ensure its security and protect its citizens. It should focus more on strengthening the Union’s competitiveness and reducing its dependencies, notably through securing critical supply chains. Moreover, it is in the EU’s own interest to preserve its role of a trusted global player.  The above-menti oned evaluation of the external instruments (2014-2020 and 2021-2027 MFFs) confirmed the added value that the external financing instruments bring to EU’s external relation s, as they provide a more integrated and sizable offer to partner countries, improving their capacity to address shared priorities with the EU and contributing to sustainable development.  As a party to most multilateral processes, the EU can engage with multilateral and regional partners in key policy areas. Compared to its Member States acting separately, the EU, together with Member States, can achieve greater impact by coordinating common positions and speaking with a stronger voice. As a world’s leading proponent and defender of multilateral and rule-based global governance system, the EU has credibility as an honest broker and defender of core international human right instruments. This leverage in multilateral and regional fora also enables the Union to project globally its policies and values, as well as influence the shaping of global norms and regulatory standards. The EU’s financial commitment is an integral part of the overall engagement in several multilateral agreements (e.g. climate and biodiversity).  Through the increased use of budgetary guarantees, financial instruments and blending operations, the EU incentivises and pools together public and private investments, including to the benefit of countries and sectors having difficult access to financial markets, investments promoting economic resilience, and private sector development. EU non-action would widen the SDGs financing investment gap and further deteriorate the situation of fragile countries while weakening the EU as a geopolitical and geoeconomic actor and as global player in multilateral fora.  Finally, the EU triggers collaboration among development financial institutions . Macro-financial assistance provides much needed financing for countries experiencing balance of payments crises, with favourable conditions.  •Proportionality  In line with the principle of proportionality, the proposed Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve its objectives.  •Choice of the instrument  In accordance with Articles 209, 212 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which set out the ordinary legislative procedure to be used to adopt measures for implementing cooperation with partner countries, the proposal takes the form of a Regulation, ensuring its uniform application, binding nature in its entirety and direct applicability. The legislative financial and digital statement enclosed with this proposal shows the budgetary implications and the human and administrative resources required.  3.RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  •Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  The mid-term evaluation of the external financing instruments under the 2021-2027 MFF concluded that they were largely fit for purpose and on track to delivery against their objectives they were expected to fulfil at the time of their adoption and these objectives continue to be relevant.  NDICI – Global Europe  The mid-term evaluation also noted that in the evolving geopolitical context, NDICI-Global Europe and its enhanced flexibility proved its relevance to pursue EU priorities as well as to provide support to partner countries notably in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine and the migratory pressures. It also enabled the EU to promote its internal policies and priorities in a more coherent manner towards the external world, while it needed to better contribute to an integrated approach balancing EU interests, partnerships and values. In terms of simplification gains, the mid-term evaluation stressed that NDICI-Global Europe provides a unified legal basis for a large share of the EU’s external interventions. By superseding a large number of the instruments of the past MFF, it had brought about a major increase in coherence and complementarity.  The mid-term evaluation mentioned that the various flexibility features in the NDICI-Global Europe had proved their relevance. However, the NDICI-Global Europe cushion had almost been depleted in the first three years of implementation, showing a mismatch between available funds and actual needs. Moreover, NDICI-Global Europe was not designed to support countries at war at the scale needed by Ukraine. Therefore, a new financing instrument, the Ukraine Facility was adopted for period 2024-27, to support Ukraine both in the face of Russia’s war of aggression and on Ukraine’s path towards EU membership. In general terms, the mid-term evaluation concluded that to better exploit windows of opportunity and maximise scope for EU leverage, differentiated response strategies may be required.  IPA III  The mid-term evaluation noted that IPA III had demonstrated its general effectiveness as a pre-accession instrument. The instrument was considered aligned with the new enlargement methodology, with the fundamentals of the EU accession process at the forefront. The mid-term evaluation also emphasised that IPA III had been effective in promoting socio-economic development and leveraging necessary investments under the Economic and Investment Plan, while there was a need to further accelerate convergence with the EU. The mid-term evaluation noted furthermore that while IPA III was designed as a performance-based instrument both in terms of scope and intensity of assistance, balancing the performance assessment with the fair share principle had limited the financial reward to well-performing beneficiaries.  The mid-term evaluation noted that IPA III had been flexible in responding to exceptional external events despite the lack of a similar cushion as in the NDICI-Global Europe instrument. The absence of pre-set country financial envelopes had provided the required flexibility to programme assistance according to urgent and evolving needs.  •Stakeholder consultation  For the mid-term evaluation and the impact assessment for this proposal, the consultation approach involved collecting input from a wide range of stakeholders on the external financing instruments. The open public consultations for both the mid-term evaluation and the impact assessment targeted all types of stakeholders, including citizens. The summary report on the results of the consultation carried out in the framework of the mid-term evaluation has been published on the “Have Your Say” website 13 and it provides an overview of the received contributions. The synopsis report of the open public consultation in view of the impact assessment for Global Europe can be found in Annex 2 of the impact assessment. A targeted consultation was also undertaken for the mid-term evaluation , to gather the views of specific categories of stakeholders. In the context of targeted consultations, EU Member States experts, development agencies of the EU Member States, civil society and local authorities’ networks and platforms, Development Financial Institutions, and the United Nations were consulted through dedicated meetings. The summary of these targeted consultations can be found in the synopsis report of the stakeholder consultation, in annex V of the the mid-term evaluation 14 .  •Collection and use of expertise  The mid-term evaluation report and associated staff working document were largely based on the independent study carried out by external consultants 15 . All five compulsory evaluation criteria (i.e. effectiveness, efficiency, relevance, coherence and the EU added value) were assessed in this study. The evaluation criteria of impact and sustainability were also covered. The evaluation methods used included: (i) a review of documentation and analytical data; (ii) more than 340 interviews(iii) a series of targeted surveys; (iv) targeted consultations and an open public consultation, as explained above. This mix of qualitative and quantitative methods, using both primary and secondary sources of evidence, provided a comprehensive evidence base for the evaluation. This expertise was also used as evidence base for the impact assessment of this proposal, together with the results of the open public consultations as explained above.  • Impact assessment  As regards the impact assessment accompanying this proposal, the Regulatory Scrutiny Board provided on 13 June 2025 its o pinion without qualification , referring to the specific approach related to the MFF process 16 . . Following the Board’s opinion, the impact assessment was revised in order to integrate its recommendations .  The general objective of the impact assessment was to design external financing instruments that effectively advance the EU’s strategic interests while being responsive to fragility and crisis situations. In this respect, the balance between flexibility and predictability was the fundamental policy parameter for the design of possible policy options. The following options were examined in this context:  • Option 1: A fully flexible external financing instrument based exclusively on strategic priorities defined annually, with no multiannual planning. Ukraine-related support for pre-accession and reconstruction needs would be covered above MFF ceilings.  • Option 2: An external financing instrument based on indicative geographic and global envelopes covering programmable and non-programmable funding for multiannual planning, balancing flexibility and predictability. Ukraine - related support for pre-accession and reconstruction needs would be covered above the MFF ceilings.  • Option 3: An external financing instrument based on indicative geographic and global envelopes covering programmable and non-programmable funding for multiannual planning, balancing flexibility and predictability. Pre-accession needs for Ukraine would be covered by this instrument inside MFF ceilings while the reconstruction needs of Ukraine would be covered above the MFF ceilings.  Based on the analysis of impacts and comparison, Option 2 emerged as the preferred choice. The analysis of effectiveness, coherence and efficiency of the three options against the baseline was made by using the specific objectives of the impact assessment. Options 2 stood out due to its flexibility-predictability equilibrium that best supported these objectives, providing credible support to Ukraine in an uncertain context while protecting the external instrument’s ability to deliver on needs and priorities in other geographical areas.  In terms of expected impact, both Options 2 and 3 are more likely than Option 1 to support the promotion of EU strategic interests and the sustainable development of partner countries.  Options 2 and 3 would also likely better address the interlinkages between the different SDGs, balancing the three dimensions of sustainable development (economic, social, and environmental). They enhance coherence between internal and external policies on the one hand and between external policies on the other. The geographisation principle, including the use of regional envelopes under the geographic pillars, facilitates alignment with the EU's strategic goals (e.g. via Global Gateway, Comprehensive Partnerships, Clean Trade and Investment Partnerships, other similar partnerships). This alignment also allows for more coordinated efforts in addressing social, economic and environmental challenges, thus ensuring that policies are mutually reinforcing rather than working in silos or at unintended cross purposes. In this respect, Options 2 and 3 have the capacity to better integrate policy objectives like competitiveness, economic security, resilient value chains, and environmental sustainability, given that these goals are strategically pursued together.  As compared to Option 3, Option 2 would ensure continuity with the Ukraine Facility’s approach, address short, medium and long-term needs comprehensively, and cover the interlinkages between Ukraine’s accession path and post-war reconstruction. Furthermore, Option 2 would allow to strike a balance between providing credible support to Ukraine in an uncertain context while protecting the external instrument’s ability to deliver on needs and priorities in other geographical areas.  Building on these considerations, option 2 has been retained for this proposal.  •Regulatory fitness and simplification  The proposal provides a simplification from the REFIT point of view. Further streamlining a number of instruments within one broad instrument as detailed above will reduce financial and operational barriers that exist under current instruments. Simplification thus contributes to clearer processes and management of resources. In terms of aligning rules, horizontal provisions from the Performance Regulation will provide the new instrument and the other programmes under the MFF with a coherent and harmonised framework and will make it easier for partners and implementing agents to understand.  •Fundamental rights  One of the Treaty-based general objectives of the EU’s external action (Article 3(5) and Articles 8 and 21 TEU) is to support and promote democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights. The Instrument aims to apply a human rights-based approach guided by the principles of ‘ leaving no one behind ’, equality and non-discrimination on any grounds. The rights-based approach encompasses all human rights, whether civil and political or economic, social and cultural in order to integrate human rights principles into all activities supported by EU external action. The support to Human Rights and Democracy, and to Civil Society Organisations, which was mostly channelled through dedicated thematic programmes in NDICI-Global Europe, remains a priority under the Instrument, channelled both through the geographic pillars to maximise impact and through the global pillar for global initiatives.  4.BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  The European Commission proposes to allocate an indicative financial envelope of EUR 200 309 000 000 (in current prices) to Global Europe for 2028-2034. Additionally, financial resources for Ukraine shall be made available in accordance with Article 6 of Council Regulation [(EU, Euratom) 20XX/XXX * [MFF Regulation]]. The detailed estimated financial impact of this proposal is presented in the legislative financial and digital statement enclosed with this proposal.  5.OTHER ELEMENTS  •Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  The Instrument should be implemented in accordance with the above-mentioned horizontal P erformance R egulation for the entire MFF, which establishes the rules for the expenditure tracking and the performance framework for the budget, including rules for ensuring a uniform application of the principles of ‘ do no significant harm ’ and gender equality referred to in Article 33(2), points (d) and (f) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/ 2509 17 (Financial Regulation) respectively, rules for monitoring and reporting on the performance of Union programmes and activities, rules for establishing a Single Gateway, rules for the evaluation of the programmes, as well as other horizontal provisions applicable to all Union programmes such as those on information, communication and visibility.  •Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  The proposed Instrument (Global Europe) contains derogations from the provisions of the Financial Regulation, which are justified in several recitals, namely:  Recital 37 – on the non-establishment of a provisioning rate for loans to Ukraine under this Instrument.  Recital 64 – on the possibility to reuse Global Europe funds carried-over. Furthermore, the recital refers to the possibility to reuse under Global Europe, reflows generated by financial instruments.  Recital 65 – on the possibility to increase the resources available for Global Europe, by assigning to it the surpluses related to the current and legacy budgetary guarantees and financial assistance in the external action.  Recitals 68 and 69 – on the possibility to provide support in the form of grants in a flexible and timely manner without the need for a call for proposals, including to private sector entities from Member States.  Recital 81 – on the possibility to promote the participation of eligible entities or persons and counterparts from partner countries benefiting from the budgetary guarantee or financial instruments, and to increase the attractiveness for the private sector and maximise the impact of the investments by extending the eligibility for the budgetary guarantee to entities without a public service mission.  TITLE I: GENERAL PROVISIONS  Article 1 (Subject matter) - defines the Instrument created by the Regulation, which is one of the EU programmes for external action.  Article 2 (Definitions) - contains definitions of the basic terminology used in the Regulation.  Article 3 (Scope and structure) - describes the structure of the Instrument, composed of five geographic pillars and one global pillar. It clarifies the internal structure of the pillars, divided in programmable and non-programmable components, detailing the nature of non-programmable actions. The Article also establishes the geographic scope of each pillar and explains the complementarity of the pillars and of the components.  The countries and territories covered under the geographic pillars are listed in Annex I.  Article 4 (Objectives of the Instrument) - sets out the general objectives, applicable to all pillars of the Instrument, as well as the specific objectives detailed in Annex II.  Article 5 (Consistency, coherence, synergies and complementarity) - explains the relationship between this Instrument and all areas of external action, together with its synergy, consistency and complementarity with internal EU programmes.  Article 6 (Budget) - refers to the overall envelope for the Instrument and gives a detailed indicative breakdown by pillar and specifies the sources of support for Ukraine. It also refers to the ‘emerging challenges and priorities cushion’, which may increase the amounts referred to in the Article.  Article 7 (Emerging challenges and priorities cushion) - refers to the purposes of the emerging challenges and priorities cushion. A provision is included to inform the European Parliament and the Council on the use of the emerging challenges and priorities cushion and to take their observations into account.  Article 8 (Policy framework) - refers to the overall policy framework for the implementation of the Instrument. Existing agreements, strategies, conclusions, resolutions and other similar documents determine the policy on which implementation of the Instrument would be based. A provision is included to inform the European Parliament and the Council and have exchanges of views with them.  Article 9 (General principles) - lists the various principles applicable to the whole Instrument, such as focusing on transformational impact, catering for the strategic interests of the Union, keeping the Union’s engagement in extremely fragile and complex settings contexts, as well as promoting democracy, good governance, the rule of law, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, gender equality, women and youth empowerment. The Article also underlines the importance of the development effectiveness principle and of the involvement and dialogue with civil society organisations and local authorities as well as the private sector.  Article 10 (Mainstreaming) – details how the fight against climate change, environment protection and gender equality should be mainstreamed in the implementation of the Instrument.  Article 11 (Team Europe Approach) - sets out the objective, the modalities and the ambition of the Team Europe approach, which aims to further coordinate the actions, and pooling resources for common goals.  Article 12 (Migration and forced displacement) - illustrates the comprehensive approach toward irregular migration, forced displacement and their root causes.  TITLE II – IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INSTRUMENT  Groups chapters related to the implementation of the Instrument, which includes the multiannual programming.  Chapter I — General programming provisions (Articles 13-17) covers the various provisions on multiannual programming, notably the general approach, principles for geographic programmes, the content of programming documents, and the procedure for adopting them.  Chapter II — Action plans, measures and implementing principles (Articles 18-22) illustrate the action plans and measures which can be adopted, and the respective procedures. Article 22 contains provisions on flexibilities.  Chapter III – Implementation toolbox (Article 23 - 28) covers the available tools to deliver against the objectives of the Instrument, notably budgetary guarantees, blending and financial assistance.  TITLE IV–- FINAL PROVISIONS  Title III (Articles 29-35). Article 30 of this Title covers the exercise of the delegation of powers, to amend Article 6(5), Article 24(1), (2) and (3) and Annex II. Article 31 illustrate the additional implementing rules for the Europe pillar. Article 32 sets up the committee, pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 182/2011. That committee is in charge of delivering an opinion on multiannual programming documents and annual work programmes (action plans and measures). The proposal has two annexes, as follows:  - Annex I — List of countries and territories  - Annex II — Specific objectives  2025/0227 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  establishing Global Europe  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 209 and 212, and Article 322(1) thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 18 ,  Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions 19 ,  Having regard to the opinion of the Court of Auditors,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) This Regulation aims at establishing the programme Global Europe (the ‘Instrument’) with a view to upholding and promoting the Union’s values, principles and interests worldwide in order to pursue the objectives and principles of the Union’s external action, as laid down in Article 3(5) and Articles 8 and 21 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU).  (2) In accordance with Article 21 TEU, the Union is to ensure consistency between the different areas of its external action and between these and its other policies, as well as to work for a high degree of cooperation in all fields of international relations. To increase coherence and ensure the effectiveness of the Union ’ s external action, the Instrument should serve a wide range of Union policies, in particular the enlargement, neighbourhood, international partnerships , humanitarian aid policies , and the external aspects of its other policies , fostered through a broad array of tools.  (3) In accordance with Article 9 of Council Decision 2010/427/EU 20 , the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (the ‘High Representative’) , in its capacity of Vice-President of the Commission, shall ensure the overall political coordination of the Union’s external action, ensuring its unity, consistency and effectiveness, in particular through the implementation of the present Instrument .  (4) The implementation of the Instrument should be guided by the Strategic Agendas of the European Council, relevant European Parliament resolutions and the Political Guidelines of the Commission , which set the Union’s vision, strategic orientations and priorities. While leveraging the Union’s power and partnerships, the external action implemented under th e Instrument should protect and promote Union values , strengthen peace and security and bolster preparedness , prosperity and competitiveness of the Union. To advance the Union’s priorities and interests in its external action, the Union should work in partnership with partner countries and international organisations.  (5) The Instrument should contribute to ensuring consistency, coherence, synergies and complementarity between the Union’s internal and external policies and between its external policies in order to simultaneously promote the Union’s fundamental and strategic interests and sustainable development in partner countries and support the achievement of its global commitments .  (6) The main approach for actions financed under the Instrument should be through geographic programmable actions at country, multi-country, regional and trans-regional level, in order to maximise the impact of the Union’s assistance. That approach should be complemented, where relevant, by non-programmable geographic actions, including actions concerning humanitarian aid, macro-financial assistance, addressing crisis, peace and foreign policy needs , and enhancing resilience and competitiveness, as well as global programmable and non-programmable actions.  (7) Geographic programmable actions should frame the Union’s cooperation with partner countries and regions in the medium and long-term to build mutually beneficial partnerships.  (8) While the budget to finance the Union’s humanitarian aid operations should be made available under this Instrument, such operations should be implemented in accordance with the Humanitarian Aid Instrument established by Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/96 21 .  (9) While the budgetary resources to finance the Union’s macro-financial assistance should be made available under this Instrument, such operations should be implemented as per Article 212 and Article 213 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union TFEU.  (10)  (11) Resilience actions should enable the Union to step up its cooperation where needed in light of the volatility of the external context. They should be flexible incl uding in responding to and reinforcing actions addressing fragility , crisis and supporting the humanitarian-development-peace nexus , address post-conflict recovery and reconstruction needs as well as balance of payment crises.  (12) Competitiveness actions should enable the Union to respond to economic challenges and swiftly seize opportunities to support Union competitiveness, including via the support to the external dimension of Union internal policies. Where relevant, they should contribute to building comprehensive mutually beneficial packages with partner countries.  (13) Crisis, peace and foreign policy needs should include actions allowing the Union to respond to exceptional and unforeseen situations or imperative foreign policy interest, including where there is a threat to peace, democracy, law and order , the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms . Th o se actions should be designed for an effective, efficient, integrated and conflict-sensitive Union response to achieve peace, stability and conflict-prevention in situations of urgency, crisis, fragility, hybrid threats, emerging crisis or natural disasters including the security and safety of individuals, in particular those exposed to sexual and gender-based violence , in situations of instability; or threatening to escalate into armed conflict or to severely destabilise the partner country or countries concerned . They should also support innovative initiatives to address foreign policy needs across political, economic and security issues and enable the Union to act where there is a window of opportunity to achieve its objectives, which are difficult to address by other means.  (14) The Instrument should build on the actions previously supported under Regulations of the European Parliament and of the Council (EU) 2021/947 22 , (EU) 2021/1529 23 , (EU) 2024/792 24 , (EU) 2024/1449 25 , (EU) 2025/535 26 .  (15) The Instrument should contribute to the objectives of the Union’s external action, by promoting mutually beneficial partnerships with partner countries, contributing simultaneously to the sustainable development of partner countries and to the Union’s strategic interests. It should allow the Union to be better positioned to address global challenges , including the fight against climate change and biodiversity protection . It should also provide increased ec onomic and trade opportunities to the mutual benefit of the Union and partner countries.  (16) Union action should promote respect for and be rooted in international human rights law, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 10 December 1948 , and in international humanitarian law, and should be guided by the universality and indivisibility of human rights.  (17) Article 49 TEU provides that any European s tate that respects the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law , as well as respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities, and is committed to promoting those values may apply to become a member of the Union. Those values are common to Member States in a society in which pluralism, non- discrimination, tolerance, justice , solidarity , equality between women and men , intergenerational fairness and cultural diversity prevail. The enlargement process is built on established criteria, fair and rigorous conditionality and the principle of own merits. A European s tate which has applied to join the Union can become a member of the Union only when it has been confirmed that it fully meets the accession criteria established at the Copenhagen European Council in June 1993 (the ‘Copenhagen criteria’) and provided that the Union has the capacity to integrate the new member. A firm commitment to ‘fundamentals first’ approach, which requires a strong focus on the rule of law, the fight against organised crime, fundamental rights, the functioning of democratic institutions and public administration reform, as well as on economic criteria, remains essential. Progress depends on each candidate country’s and potential candidate’s implementation of the necessary reforms to align with the Union acquis.  (18) The enlargement policy of the Union is a strategic investment in peace, security, stability and prosperity in Europe and allows the Union to be better positioned to address global challenges. It also provides increased economic and trade opportunities to the mutual benefit of the Union and the aspiring Member States, while ensuring a gradual transformation of the partner countries . The prospect of Union membership has a powerful transformative effect, embedding positive democratic, political, economic and societal change. It is in the common interest of the Union and its partners to advance efforts to reform their political, legal and economic systems with a view to their future Union membership and to support their accession process .  (19) Since the beginning of Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified war of aggression against Ukraine on 24 February 2022, the Union, its Member States and European financial institutions have mobilised unprecedented support for Ukraine’s economic, social and financial resilience. The scale of damage caused to Ukraine requires significant and flexible support to Ukraine to maintain functions of its government, provide public services, as well as to support the recovery, reconstruction and modernisation of the country. The Instrument should provide the framework for assistance for the fast recovery, reconstruction and modernisation of the country, to mobilise investments and enhance access to finance, as well as to facilitate Ukraine’s alignment with Union standards and values on its way to accession to the Union . Ukraine’s path towards accession should be closely intertwined with reconstruction efforts. Support under the Instrument should, to the extent possible, be integrated into international efforts towards a financial architecture for the recovery of Ukraine and be coordinated with relevant donors and international financial institutions to ensure proper coordination and complementarity of support.  (20) In accordance with Article 8(1) TEU, the Union is to develop a special relationship with neighbouring countries, aiming to establish an area of prosperity and good neighbourliness, founded on the values of the Union and characterised by close and peaceful relations based on cooperation.  (21) The Union should conclude mutually beneficial and tailored partnerships focusing on strategic priorities and fostering regional cooperation in the Neighbourhood East, including the Black Sea region and helping mitigate challenges posed by Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine.  (22) The Union should develop a more focused approach to the Middle East, North Africa and the Gulf , taking into account the inter-relations among these regions. It should deepen relations with the Middle East, North Africa and Gulf regions, in line with the respective strategic frameworks and formal agreements, in particular through mutually beneficial and tailored partnership s in areas of mutual interests, respecting the values and principles of the Union.  (23) The Union’s international partnerships aim at developing relations and build partnerships with partner countries, notably to reduce and, in the long term, eradicate poverty in line with the primary objective of the Union’s development cooperation policy set out in Article 208 TFEU. The Union’s international partnerships also contribute to other objectives of the Union’s external action, in particular to the safeguarding of the Union’s values and fundamental interests, to foster the sustainable economic, social and environmental development of partner countries.  (24) The implementation of the Instrument should support the Global Gateway strategy 27 , the Union’s external investment strategy to advance the sustainable development goals together with partner countries. As a main pillar of the Union’s economic foreign policy, it aims at boosting the development of secure and quality infrastructure in partner countries to create sustainable prosperity, decent jobs, thereby strengthening connections between the Union and its partners , while also benefiting the EU strategic and economic interests . This strategy leverage s investments in secure infrastructure with a focus on digitalisation, climate and energy, transport, health, and education and research. It supports countries which seek to enhance their resilience in a sustainable manner, while strengthening partnerships that are important for the Union’s open strategic autonomy. Global Gateway is also a value-based offer that promotes high social, environmental, governance and financial standards, and upholds democracy, the rule of law and human rights .  (25) The Union should engage in contexts experiencing extremely high levels of fragility, conflict areas, and other complex settings, supporting them through a differentiated approach to address the root causes of fragility while providing access to basic services and promoting the resilience of populations, along the h umanitarian- d evelopment- p eace nexus.  (26) The Instrument should contribute to preserving peace, preventing conflicts and strengthening international security . In line with the P rotect EU Strategy 28 , the Instrument should contribute to a coherent and comprehensive approach to security t o enhance the Union ’s security .  (27) The I nstrument should strengthen democratic resilience in partner countries , including by countering foreign information manipulation and interference, empowering free and pluralistic media, promoting citizens’ engagement, ensuring the fairness and integrity of electoral and other democratic processes, and by engaging in public diplomacy activities.  (28) In accordance with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 adopted at the Third UN World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction on 18 March 2015 29 , recognition should be given to the need to move away from crisis response and containment to a more structural, long-term approach that more effectively addresses situations of fragility, natural and man-made disasters, and protracted crises. Greater emphasis and collective approaches are required on risk reduction, disaster risk management, early warning, prevention, mitigation and preparedness, and further efforts are required to enhance swift response and a durable recovery. This instrument should support reforms and investments that strengthen disaster risk and crisis management, invest in climate resilience, and enhance the resilience of vital societal functions . The Instrument should therefore contribute to strengthening the humanitarian-development-peace nexus.  (29) Since the objectives of this Regulation cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 TEU. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.  (30) The Instrument should contribute to the collective Union objective of providing 0.7 % of g ross n ational i ncome as o fficial d evelopment a ssistance (‘ODA’) , established by the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD, within the timeframe of the 2030 Agenda adopted by the United Nations in September 2015 30 (the ‘2030 Agenda’ ) , by supporting realistic and verifiable actions to meet this commitment, on which progress should continue to be monitored and reported. It should also promote mutually beneficial partnerships for sustainable development, including through the mobilisation of private resources. The whole support of the Instrument to sustainable development – including the mobilised private finance - should be monitored through the Total Official Support for Sustainable Development.  (31) The Instrument should contribute to the Union collective target of reaching 0.2 % of g ross n ational i ncome as ODA to l east d eveloped c ountries within the timeframe of the 2030 Agenda, by supporting realistic, verifiable actions to meet this commitment, on which progress should continue to be monitored and reported.  (32) The Instrument should enhance the Union’s competitiveness, in particular by contributing to the sustainability, resilience and diversification of value and supply chains , reflecting high standards of responsible business practice, and by increasing economic opportunities . Consistency between the implementation of the Union’s trade , economic security , and industrial policies and th e Instrument should be ensured , including synergies with Clean T rade and I nvestment P artnerships . In particular, in order to harness the potential of mutually beneficial partnerships for sustainable development in the Union and partner countries , synergies should be fostered between the Instrument and the Union’s European Competitiveness Fund , established by Regulation (EU) [XXX] by the European Parliament and Council 31 , as well as the Connecting Europe Facility, established by Regulation (EU) [XXX] by the European Parliament and Council 32 , in supporting projects of common interest between Member States and partner countries, for the part of the project on the territory of the partner country .  (33) Complementarity should be ensured among the Union’s external financing instruments, in particular with Council Decision (EU) 2021 /1764 33 on the association of the overseas countries and territories with the Union, the European Instrument for International Nuclear Safety Cooperation - Decommissioning established by Council Regulation (Euratom) [XXX] [ INSC-D ] 34 , the common foreign and security policy including, where relevant, the Common Security and Defence Policy, and the European Peace Facility , established by Council Decision (CFSP) 2015 / 509 35 , which is financed outside the Union budget.  (34) The Union should seek the most efficient use of available resources among its financing instruments. In this respect, the Instrument should allow for both contributions to and from other Union programmes, as well as the combination of funding with them. This should contribute to the Union’s priorities and interests as well as to sustainable development in the Union’s partner countries . This includes coherence and complementarity with macro-financial assistance, where relevant.  (35) This Regulation should lay down an indicative financial envelope for the Instrument. For the purpose of this Regulation, current prices are calculated by applying a fixed 2% deflator.  (36) In a rapidly changing economic, social and geopolitical environment, recent experience has shown the need for a more flexible multiannual financial framework and Union spending programmes. To that effect, and in line with the objectives of this Regulation, the funding should duly consider the evolving policy needs and Union’s priorities as identified in relevant documents published by the Commission, in Council conclusions and European Parliament resolutions while ensuring sufficient predictability for the budget implementation.  (37) Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) …/… 36 ( MFF Regulation ) allows to mobilise the necessary appropriations in the Union budget over and above the ceilings of the m ultiannual f inancial f ramework to honour the debt liabilities of the Union related to the loans to Ukraine. This financially enables the authorisation under this Regulation of financial assistance to Ukraine in the form of loans in accordance with Article 223(1) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 37 .  (38) In view of the budgetary coverage under the Regulation (EU, Euratom) …/… ( MFF Regulation ) , it is appropriate not to reduce the maximum amount of the aggregate Union financial liabilities covering budgetary guarantees and financial assistance in the form of loans under this Regulation by the amount of financial assistance in the form of loans provided to Ukraine under this Regulation. It is also appropriate not to establish provisioning and, by way of derogation from Article 214(1) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 , not to set a provisioning rate for loans to Ukraine under this Instrument .  (39) As for Union support to Ukraine other than in the form of loans, this Regulation should be financed by the (Ukraine Reserve) as provided for in the Council Regulation [(EU, Euratom) 20XX/XXX * [MFF Regulation] for the period from 1 January 2028 to 31 December 2034 . The commitment appropriations and corresponding payment appropriations from the (Ukraine Reserve) should be mobilised annually through the budget procedure. Additionally, it should be possible to use appropriations mobilised for the purposes of this Regulation from the reserve referred to in Article 6 of Regulation Council Regulation [(EU, Euratom) 20XX/XXX * [MFF Regulation ] ) to provide support to Ukraine under Regulation (Euratom) […] ( INSC-D ) .  (40) In the framework of the Union’s restrictive measures, adopted on the basis of Article 29 TEU and 215(2) TFEU, no funds or economic resources may be made available, directly or indirectly, to or for the benefit of designated natural or l egal persons, entities or bodies. Therefore, s uch natural or legal persons, entities or bodies, as well as legal persons, entities or bodies owned or controlled by them should not be supported by the Instrument.  (41) In a global context where the Union is confronted with high geopolitical and geoeconomic competition, marked by global challenges, ranging from climate change and biodiversity loss to tensions around scarce resources, technological dependencies, continuing migratory pressure or economic and trade disruptions, in addition to security threats and fragility, external action has to continuously and rapidly react to emerging needs, as well as to act to advance strategic priorities, in order to effectively pursue the Union’s and partners’ priorities. To increase the ability of the Union to respond to unforeseen needs and adapt its partnerships to emerging priorities, building on the experience of the European Development Funds and Regulation (EU) 2021/947 , an amount should be left unallocated as an emerging challenges and priorities cushion. It should be mobilised in accordance with the procedures established in this Regulation.  (42) The overall context for action should be the pursuit of a rules-based and value-based global order, with multilateralism as its key principle and the United Nations ( UN ) at its core. The 2030 Agenda, together with the Paris Agreement adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 38 (the ‘Paris Agreement’) , the Kunming - Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework 39 , the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development 40 and the Pact for the Future 41 , is the international community’s response to global challenges and trends in relation to sustainable development. The Instrument should pay particular attention to interlinkages betw een sustainable development goals and to integrated actions that can create co-benefits and meet multiple objectives in a coherent way.  (43) The Instrument should support the implementation of the Samoa Partnership Agreement between the Union and its Member States, of the one part, and the Members of the Organisation of the African, Caribbean and Pacific States, of the other part 42 , signed in Samoa on 15 November 2023 and provisionally applied as from 1 January 2024. T he Instrument should also support the continuation of the established cooperation between the Union and these specific regions, for example with the African Union in line with the EU-AU joint vision for 2030.  (44) The Union should ensure policy coherence for development as required by Article 208 TFEU. The Union should take account of the objectives of development cooperation in the Union policies that are likely to affect developing countries and territories . Ensuring policy coherence for sustainable development requires taking into account the impact of all Union policies on sustainable development at all levels — nationally, within the Union, in other countries and at global level.  (45) In accordance with its international commitments, the Union should apply the development effectiveness principles, namely ownership of development priorities by developing countries and territories , a focus on results, inclusive development partnerships, transparency and mutual accountability. In that regard, the Union and its Member States should maximise the value added of their collective assistance for partner countries and regions. The implementation of the Instrument should be guided by its expected results namely outputs, outcomes and impacts.  (46) The Union should foster close consultation with local authorities and civil society, as well as support their participation in contributing to sustainable development and to the implementation of the sustainable development goals at local level. The Union should also support an enabling environment for civil society , in which these organisations can carry out their work effectively . The Instrument should provide Union support to civil society organisations and local authorities in order to pursue the values, interests and objectives of the Union. Civil society organisations and local authorities should be duly consulted and have timely access to relevant information allowing them to be adequately engaged.  (47) The implementation of the Instrument should be guided by the principles of gender equality, women and girls’ empowerment and of preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence and should seek to protect and promote women’s rights in line with the Roadmap on Women’s Rights 43 , Gender Equality Strategy 44 , EU Gender Action Plans, relevant Council conclusions and international conventions, including the Istanbul Convention on violence against women 45 . Strengthening gender equality and women’s empowerment in the Union’s external action and increasing efforts to reach the minimum standards of performance indicated by the EU Gender Action Plans should lead to a gender sensitive and transformative approach in all Union external action and international cooperation. Gender equality and women’s and girls’ empowerment should be mainstreamed under the Instrument and adequately reflected across all the actions.  (48) The I nstrument should support children and youth as key agents of change, giving particular attention to their needs and empowerment . It should seek to prevent and combat discrimination - based on age, ethnic origin, religion and belief, disability or sexual orientation. It should promote the rights of persons with disabilities , in line with the UN Convention to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 46 .  (49) Recognising that the triple planetary crisis of climate, biodiversity loss and pollution have worsened over the last decade and cannot be solved by the Union alone, by supporting international cooperation the Instrument should play an essential role to meet multilaterally agreed climate and environmental goals . In that regard, the Union should support the most vulnerable countries, in particular the s mall i sland d eveloping s tates and the l east d eveloped c ountrie s.  (50) Reflecting the importance of tackling climate change in line with the Union’s commitments to implement the Paris Agreement and the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework and to achieve the sustainable development goals, t he Instrument should contribute to mainstreaming climate action in the Union policies . Relevant actions should be identified during the implementation of the Instrument, and the overall contribution from the Instrument should be part of relevant monitoring evaluations and review processes. The Instrument should contribute to halting and reversing the decline of biodiversity building on the interlinkages between climate and biodiversity goals.  (51) Union action in the area of climate change and biodiversity should support a just transition to a climate-neutral , climate resilient, resource efficient and circular economy. It should notably favour the adherence to and implementation of the Paris Agreement, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, the UN Convention to Combat Desertification and the Agreement on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas beyond National Jurisdiction. In particular, funding allocated in the context of the Instrument should be coherent with and support the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement of limiting the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels while pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1 . 5°C. T he Instrument should be coherent with the objective to increase the ability to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change, reduce vulnerability, foster climate resilience and align with the objectives of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. In line with the European Ocean Pact 47 , the Instrument should promote the preservation of the ocean and strengthen international rules-based ocean governance . Particular attention should be given to actions that create co-benefits and meet multiple objectives, including for climate, biodiversity and the environment.  (52) Article 33(2), point (d), of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 requires programmes and activities to be implemented, where feasible and appropriate, without doing significant harm to the environmental objectives set out in Article 9 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 48 (the ‘do no significant harm principle’). To ensure a consistent implementation of that principle throughout the budget, the Instrument should apply the do no significant harm principle in line with the common rules established by Regulation (EU, Euratom) [XXX] of the European Parliament and Council [ Performance Regulation ] and following the single technical guidance ('do no significant harm guidance') ,  (53) The Instrument should promote digital cooperation with partner countries and the ir digital transition, in line with the International Digital Strategy for the European Union 49 and the Competitiveness Compass 50 .  (54) In accordance with Article 210 TFEU, the Union and its Member States should increase their collective impact by bring ing together to the fullest possible range their respective resources and capacities.  (55) The Union’s and Member States’ international cooperation policies should operate in a Team Europe approach 51 , thereby complement ing and reinforc ing each other to improve the effectiveness, impact and value added of their collective assistance.  (56) The Union, its Member States, Member States’ implementing agencies and financial institutions, including development finance institutions and Member States export credit agencies, the European Investment Bank (the ‘EIB’) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the ‘EBRD’) should seek to support partner countries and Union strategic interests outside the Union through jointly identified and implemented actions. This approach should be inclusive and open to like-minded partners and stakeholders to pool resources and jointly contribute to the achievement of common goals including through the use of the budgetary guarantee and blending .  (57) The Union should favour a constructive engagement on all aspects of migration and forced displacement, working to ensure that migration takes place in a safe and well-regulated manner and support is provided to forcibly displaced people and their host communities. It is essential to further step up cooperation on migration with partner countries while respecting competences of Member States, reaping the benefits of orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and effectively addressing irregular migration. Such cooperation should contribute to mitigating the impact of forced displacement, ensuring access to international protection, addressing the root causes of irregular migration and of forced displacement, enhancing border management and pursuing efforts to prevent irregular migration, fighting against trafficking in human beings and migrant smuggling, and working on dignified and sustainable returns, readmission and reintegration where relevant, on the basis of mutual accountability and full respect of humanitarian and human rights obligations under international and Union law, and by engaging with diasporas and supporting legal migration pathways. Therefore, partner countries’ effective cooperation with the Union in this area should be an integral element of the Instrument. Increased coherence between migration, asylum , return and external policies is important to ensure that the Union’s external assistance supports partner countries to manage migration more effectively towards sustainable development. The Instrument should contribute to a coordinated, holistic and structured approach to migration, maximising synergies and applying the necessary leverage.  (58) The Instrument should enable the Union, in cooperation with Member States, to comprehensively respond to challenges, needs and opportunities related to migration and forced displacement in a way that is coherent with and complementary to Union migration and asylum policy . Migration-related actions under the Instrument should contribute to the effective implementation of Union agreements and dialogues on migration with partner countries by encouraging cooperation relying on a flexible incitative approach and supported by a coordination mechanism under the Instrument. The coordination mechanism should enable ongoing and emerging migration and forced displacement challenges to be addressed under the Instrument, using all appropriate components through flexible funding, while respecting its financial envelopes and relying on their flexible implementation. Those actions should be implemented in full respect of international law, including international human rights, international humanitarian law and refugee law, and Union and national competences.  (59) Under the Instrument, the Union should address human rights and democratic governance at all levels, including through election observation missions, in line with the EU Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy 52 . Where relevant, Union assistance in areas pertaining to the protection of human rights and democratic values and principles and support to civil society actors should be independent from the consent of the governments and public authorities of the partner countries concerned. As the respect for democracy, human rights and the rule of law is essential for sound financial management and effective Union funding as referred to in Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 , assistance could be suspended in the event of degradation in democracy, human rights or the rule of law in third countries .  (60) Funding under the Instrument should be used to finance actions for the international dimension of the Erasmus+ programme , including in line with the Union of Skills 53 . The multiannual programming of the international dimension of Erasmus+ under this Instrument should be implemented in accordance with the procedures established in Regulation (EU) [XXX] of the European Parliament and Council [ Erasmus+ Regulation ] 54 .  (61) The Instrument should contribute to foster international cultural relations and recognise the role of culture in promoting the Union’s values.  (62) Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 applies to this Instrument. It lays down the rules on the establishment and the implementation of the general budget of the European Union, including the rules on grants, prizes, non-financial donations, procurement, indirect management , financial assistance, financial instruments and budgetary guarantees.  (63) Annual or multi-annual action plans and measures referred to in this Regulation should constitute work programmes within the meaning of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 . Annual or multi-annual action plans should consist of a set of measures grouped into one document.  (64) Rules on effective establishment or nationality, or the type of participants in award procedures, including with respect to their direct and indirect control by entities of a partner country, as well as the origin of products may be restricted, including where such restrictions are in the strategic interests of the Union. Such restrictions could, for example, apply to high-risk suppliers, where relevant.  (65) While respecting the principle that the Union budget is set annually, external volatility requires to preserve the flexibilities already allowed under Regulation (EU) 2021/947 concerning carry-overs . By way of derogation from Article 12(4) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 , to ensure the efficient use of the Union funds both for Union citizens and the partner countries, thus maximising the Union funds available for the Union’s external action interventions, carry-overs stemming from the Instrument should be available to be reused under this Instrument. By way of derogation from Article 212(3) of Regulation (EU, Euratom ) 2024/2509 , revenue, repayments and recoveries from financial instruments established by external action programmes under this or preceding multiannual financial frameworks should be available to be reused under this Instrument. This will make available the necessary resources to fund the most pressing additional needs of the EU’s external relations of the moment.  (66) To increase the resources available for th e Instrument by assigning to it the surpluses related to the Guarantee Fund for external actions established by Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 480/2009, the European Fund for Sustainable Development (EFSD) established by Regulation (EU) 2017/1601 55 , the European Fund for Sustainable Development Plus (EFSD+) established by Regulation (EU) 2021/ 947 , the Ukraine Guarantee established by Regulation (EU) 2024/792, the financial assistance in the form of loans established under Regulations (EU) 2024/1449, and (EU) 2025/535 , and the budgetary guarantee and financial assistance under this Instrument, derogation s from Article 216(4), point (a), of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 and from Article 31(8) of Regulation (EU) 2021/947 are is required. This will make available the necessary resources to fund the most pressing additional needs of the EU’s external relations of the moment .  (67) To ensure flexibility, Article 114(2), third subparagraph of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 should not apply to the multiannual actions under this Instrument.  (68) The types of financing and the methods of implementation under this Regulation should be chosen on the basis of their ability to achieve the specific objectives of the actions and to deliver results, taking into account, in particular, the costs of controls, the administrative burden and the expected risk of non-compliance. When making that choice, the use of lump sums, unit costs and flat rates, as well as financing not linked to costs of the relevant operation as referred to in Article 125(1), point (a), of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 , should be considered. The Union should be able to entrust budget implementation tasks under Article 62(1), point (c) (viii) of Regulation (EU) 2024/2509 to the Union Institute for Security Studies and the European Security and Defence College t o implement actions under the Instrument.  (69) By way of derogation from Article 192(1) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509, the Union should be able to provide support in the form of grants in a flexible and timely manner without the need for a call for proposals, for example, in difficult conditions and cases of urgency and crisis, to support human rights defenders and other civil society actors. Under the conditions set out in Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509, grants funded by the Instrument could also be provided to civil society organisations and other entities which do not have legal personality under the applicable national law.  (70) Without prejudice to the use of competitive procedures wherever appropriate in accordance with Article 192(1) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 , grants could be provided to entities governed by private law from a Member State without a call for proposals where the relevant project is in the strategic interest of the Union and supports the objectives of the Instrument. Such a direct award could be justified, for example, to enable investments or finance feasibility studies in strategic areas such as critical raw materials , climate change resilience or digital and other infrastructure, in particular as part of integrated packages, to enhance the Union’s strategic autonomy. In accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 , any such award should respect the general principles applicable to grants and be duly justified in the award decision.  (71) In line with the Team Europe approach, actions in indirect management should preferably be entrusted to the EIB , the EBRD , or a Member State organisation in the sense of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 .  (72) In indirect management with partner countries or the bodies they designate where the Commission retains financial management responsibilities in accordance with Article 157(7), second subparagraph, point ( a), of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/ 2509 , the Commission, when making payments on behalf of the contracting authorities directly to their recipients should be able to subsequently recover related amounts due directly from the contracting authorities' recipients. Likewise, in cases of indirect management where the partner countries or the bodies they designate do not or become unable to perform the budget implementation tasks entrusted, the Commission should be able to temporarily take their place and act in their name and on their behalf in indirect management.  (73) Pursuant to Article 85(1) of Council Decision (EU) 2021/1764, persons and entities established in overseas countries and territories are eligible for funding subject to the rules and objectives of the Instrument and possible arrangements applicable to the Member State to which the relevant overseas country or territory is linked. In order to reinforce the effectiveness and impact of the Union's action, c ooperation between the partner countries and regions, the overseas countries and territories as well as the Union outermost regions under Article 349 TFEU should be encouraged in areas of common interest.  (74) The Instrument should enable the provision of support in the form of budgetary guarantees and financial assistance. The provisioning and liabilities arising from those operations and the financial assistance should be supported by appropriations under the Instrument.  (75) With a view to ensuring consistency, the budgetary guarantee and financial instruments, including when combined with non-repayable support in blending operations, and financial assistance under th e Instrument should be implemented in accordance with Title X of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 and with technical arrangements, terms and conditions established by the Commission for the purposes of its application.  (76) After the EFSD in 2017-2020 and the EFSD+ in 2021-2027, this is the third multiannual financial framework where a budgetary guarantee is used to support external actions. The budgetary guarantee has become a standard tool in the Union’s financial toolbox and its main rules and procedures are enshrined in Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 . Only specific provisions applicable to the budgetary guarantee under the Instrument are foreseen in this Regulation. On the other hand, recognising that the investments mobilised by the Union in partner countries may need a flexible use and combination of the various forms of Union’s funding available under the Instrument, no particular treatment of blending operations and the budgetary guarantee under a specific fund, such as EFSD or EFSD+, is foreseen.  (77) To provide for predictability and flexibility, it is necessary to set a maximum amount of the budgetary guarantee and the maximum amount of the aggregate Union financial liabilities covering the budgetary guarantee and financial assistance in the form of loans under the Instrument.  (78) In accordance with Article 214(1) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 , this R egulation should provide for the review of the provisioning rate s . It should therefore be possible to amend the provisioning rate s throughout the multiannual financial framework period following regular review, which sh ould be based on the Commission ’s risk management framework taking into account sound financial management.  (79) To comply with the requirements of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 , this Regulation should set out the possibility for third parties and partner countries to contribute to the budgetary guarantee .  (80) It should be possible that the budgetary guarantee authorised under this Regulation serve s as a horizontal delivery tool also for Council Decision (EU) 2021/1764 and Regulation (Euratom) [XXX] [ INSC -D ] , to provide support under other Union programmes in accordance with the objectives and eligibility criteria set out in those programmes. For that purpose, the corresponding provisioning of financial liabilities should be made from the financial envelope of those other programmes.  (81) To ensure sound financial management and budgetary discipline and to limit outstanding payments, the provisioning for the budgetary guarantee and financial assistance should not be committed after the end of the last year of the multiannual financial framework and should be constituted by the end of the third year after the end of the multiannual financial framework . Budgetary commitments for that provisioning should take into account the progress in granting the budgetary guarantee and financial assistance. The constitution of the provisioning should take into account the progress in the approval and signature of the financing and investment operations and in the disbursement of the financial assistance.  (82) In order to promote the participation of eligible implementing entities and counterparts from partner countries benefiting from the budgetary guarantee or financial instruments, by way of derogation from Article 211 ( 5) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 , the partner country should not be required to contribute to the budgetary guarantee or the financial instruments. Moreover, in order to provide flexibility, increase the attractiveness for the private sector and maximise the impact of the investments, a derogation from Article 62(1) , point ( c) and Article 211(5) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 , should be provided allowing bodies subject to private law which provide adequate assurance of their financial capacity and which are neither entrusted with a public service mission nor with the implementation of a public-private partnership to be eligible implementing entities and counterparts .  (83) Blending and budgetary guarantees play a central role in the Union’s investment strategy in partners countries. It is, therefore, appropriate to set up a Global Europe Investment Board to provide strategic and operational guidance to the Commission in their implementation.  (84) It is appropriate to organise the financial assistance under the diversified funding strategy provided for in Article 224 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 and established as a single funding method therein, which is expected to enhance the liquidity of Union debt securities and the attractiveness and cost-effectiveness of Union issuance.  (85) The Commission could provide financial assistance to partners countries in the form of policy-based loans. The primary purpose of such policy-based loans should be to support partner country’s reform programmes and catalyse investments. They should contribute to achieving national policy goals and meeting global challenges. The conditions applicable to policy-based loans should, where relevant, be aligned to the conditions of budget support in accordance with Article 241(1) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 . A debt analysis should be conducted prior to the approval of any loan. This analysis should assess the country's ability to sustain its debt levels over the loan term.  (86) In order to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation , the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of amending the specific objectives listed in Annex II, the percentage of expenditure fulfilling the criteria of ODA , the maximum amount s of the budgetary guarantee and the provisioning rates . It is of particular importance that the Commission carr ies out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making 56 . In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States' experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.  (87) Cooperation with partner countries covered under the Europe pillar occurs in the context of a special relationship with the Union, including through, where relevant, the preparation of candidate countries and potential candidates for future accession. Such cooperation requires the establishment of specific conditions reflecting this highly ambitious relationship. For this purpose, relevant for Enlargement and Neighbourhood East partners in the Europe pillar, specific rules related to the relevant performance-based plans serving as a basis for programming should be established in line with the correspondingly high ambition of mutual relations between the partner count r ies and the Union. In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of such engagement and for the implementation modalities that are designed to prepare for the management of internal funds, such as structural, agricultural and rural development and cross-border cooperation funds, including, where relevant, for indirect management by the partner countries , implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by the Member States of the Commission's exercise of implementing powers 57 . Those uniform conditions should be amended if developments so require.  (88) In the context of assistance provided to Enlargement and Neighbourhood East partners in the Europe pillar, cooperation should build on the lessons learn ed from the management and implementation of past assistance and performance-based facilities, including in relation to the relevant performance -based plans, conditionality linked to rule of law principles and human rights , performance, structures and control systems to be set up in preparation of accession. Where relevant, financial assistance in the form of a policy-based loan may be provided to partner countries implementing p erformance-based plans.  (89) In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of the Instrument through the relevant implementing acts, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011. The Commission may adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases relating to crises or immediate threats to peace, democracy, the rule of law, human rights or fundamental freedoms, imperative grounds of urgency so require.  (90) The Instrument should contribute to strengthening awareness, understanding and perception of the Union in a Team Europe approach in partner countries. The objective should be to position the Union as a reliable partner that is commensurate with the scale, scope and ambition of the Union ’s political commitment and sustained investment. This should be achieved through impactful strategic communication , and in line with Regulation (EU, Euratom) [XXX] [ Performance Regulation ] 58 .  (91) The Instrument is to be implemented in accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) [XXX] [Performance Regulation] which establishes the rules for the expenditure tracking and the performance framework for the budget, including rules for ensuring a uniform application of the principles of ‘do no significant harm’ and gender equality referred to in Article 33(2), points (d) and (f), of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 respectively, rules for monitoring and reporting on the performance of Union programmes and activities, rules for establishing a Union funding portal, rules for the evaluation of the programmes, rules for the evaluation of the programmes, as well as other horizontal provisions applicable to all Union programmes such as those on information, communication and visibility.  (92) The references to the Union ’s external assistance instruments in Article 9 of Decision 2010/427/EU, which are the predecessors to the Instrument established by this Regulation, should be construed as references to this Regulation. The Commission should ensure that this Regulation is implemented in accordance with the role of the European External Action Service as provided in that Decision.  (93) In accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 , Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council 59 , Council Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2988/95 60 , Council Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 61 and Council Regulation (EU) 2017/1939 62 , the financial interests of the Union are to be protected through proportionate measures, including the prevention, detection, correction and investigation of irregularities and fraud, the recovery of funds lost, wrongly paid or incorrectly used and, where appropriate, the imposition of administrative sanctions. In particular, in accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 and Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 , the European Anti-Fraud Office ( ‘ OLAF ’ ) may carry out investigations, including on-the-spot checks and inspections, with a view to establishing whether there has been fraud, corruption or any other illegal activity affecting the financial interests of the Union. In accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017/1939, the European Public Prosecutor's Office ( ‘ EPPO ’ ) may investigate and prosecute fraud and other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Union as provided for in Directive (EU) 2017/1371 of the European Parliament and of the Council 63 . In accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 , any person or entity receiving Union funds is to fully cooperate in the protection of the Union’s financial interests, to grant the necessary rights and access to the Commission, OLAF, the EPPO and the European Court of Auditors and to ensure that any third parties involved in the implementation of Union funds grant equivalent rights.  (94) This Instrument replaces the programmes established by Regulations (EU) 2021/947, (EU) 2021/1529, (EU) 2024/792, (EU) 2024/1449 and (EU) 2025/535.

FRAMEWORK OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE  1.1. Title of the proposal/initiative  Global Europe  1.2. Policy area(s) concerned  External Action  1.3. Objective(s)  1.3.1. General objective(s)  The general objective of the proposed Instrument, Global Europe, is to uphold and promote the Union’s values, principles and interests worldwide in order to pursue the objectives and principles of the Union’s external action, as laid down in Article 3(5), Articles 8 and 21 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU).  1.3.2. Specific objective(s)  The specific objectives of the Instrument are spelt out in Annex II.  1.3.3. Expected result(s) and impact  Specify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.  Global Europe will contribute to the objectives of the EU’s external action, by promoting mutually beneficial partnerships with third countries, contributing simultaneously to the sustainable development of third countries and to the Union’s strategic interests. Global Europe will also allow the Union to be better positioned to address global challenges.  1.3.4. Indicators of performance  Specify the indicators for monitoring progress and achievements.  The output and result indicators for the purpose of monitoring progress and achievements of this programme will correspond to the common indicators provided under Regulation (EU, Euratom) [XXX] [Performance Regulation].  1.4. The proposal/initiative relates to:  ¨ a new action  ¨ a new action following a pilot project / preparatory action 72  ¨ the extension of an existing action  x a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action  1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative  1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative  The objective of the proposed Instrument, Global Europe, is to uphold and promote the Union’s values, principles and interests worldwide in order to pursue the objectives and principles of the Union’s external action, as laid down in Article 3(5), Articles 8 and 21 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU).  Global Europe will contribute to the objectives of the EU’s external action, by promoting mutually beneficial partnerships with third countries, contributing simultaneously to the sustainable development of third countries and to the Union’s strategic interests. Global Europe will also allow the Union to be better positioned to address global challenges.  1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, great er effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this section 'added value of EU involvement' is the value resulting from EU action, that is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.  Reasons for action at EU level (ex-ante)  The international landscape has changed significantly over the last years, appearing far less predictable and stable. Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, including its global impact, instability and conflict in the Middle East, pandemics, trade tensions, economic coercion, competition on technology and access to critical raw materials and the US administration’s disengagement from development cooperation, humanitarian aid and multilateral institutions represent significant geopolitical and geoeconomic challenges both for the EU and partner countries. Furthermore, the gap to reach the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 continues to widen, global fragility is on the rise, and the impacts of climate change and biodiversity loss continue to increase. These challenges require the EU to continue adapting its external action financing.  EU’s external action financing seeks to partner with third countries, as well as promote multilateral solutions to global challenges. It enables the EU to defend its interests, to promote its values and standards, to support the objectives of its internal policies, ensure its security and protect its citizens. The mid-term evaluation of EU's External Financing Instruments for the 2021 - 2027 multiannual financial framework confirmed the added value that the External Financing Instruments bring to EU’s external relations, as they provide a more integrated and sizable offer to partner countries, improving their capacity to address shared priorities with the EU and contributing to sustainable development.  As a party to most multilateral processes, the EU can engage with multilateral and regional partners in key policy areas. Compared to its Member States acting separately, the EU, together with Member States, can achieve greater impact by coordinating common positions and speaking with a stronger voice. As a world’s leading proponent and defender of multilateral and rule-based global governance system, the EU has credibility as an honest broker and defender of core international human rights instruments. This leverage in multilateral and regional fora also enables the Union to project globally its policies and values, as well as influence the shaping of global norms and regulatory standards. The EU’s financial commitment is an integral part of the overall engagement in several multilateral agreements (e.g. climate and biodiversity).  Through the increased use of budgetary guarantees and blending operations, the EU incentivises and pools together public and private investments, including to the benefit of countries and sectors having difficult access to financial markets. Finally, the EU triggers collaboration among development financial institutions. Macro- financial assistance provides much needed financing for countries experiencing balance of payments crises, with favourable conditions.  Expected generated EU added value (ex-post)  The expected added value generated by Global Europe should follow on from the findings of the mid-term evaluation of EU's External Financing Instruments for the 2021 - 2027 Multiannual Financial Framework. Global Europe should allow to consolidate and streamline external action financing, enabling the Union to protect its interests abroad and adapt to evolving circumstances and needs. The Union shall strive to ensure policy coherence, taking into account the impact of all internal and external policies and promoting increased synergies and complementarities.  Global Europe shall provide all the tools for the EU to effectively operate in its external action. The readiness of this toolbox will ensure that the most appropriate tools are deployed in every circumstance depending on the objectives and the situation on the ground, with the possibility to adapt to evolving contexts.  This will harness the potential of mutually beneficial partnerships packages targeted for individual partner countries.  1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past  The mid-term evaluation on the EU’s external financing instruments confirms that the current instruments are largely fit for purpose . The evaluation corroborates that NDICI-Global Europe is on track to deliver against the objectives it was expected to fulfil at the time of its adoption. Moreover, the objectives of NDICI-Global Europe continue to be relevant and the instrument effectively serves the roll-out the Global Gateway strategy. In a similar vein, the mid-term evaluation shows that IPA III has demonstrated its general effectiveness as a pre-accession instrument and is likewise on track to meet its objectives. The instrument is aligned with the enlargement methodology and mirrors EU policy developments, such as the focus on green, digital and economic priorities.  However, following years of instability in the EU’s neighbourhood and beyond, the geopolitical stakes for the EU are far higher than when the 2021-2027 MFF was adopted. The EU operates in a highly volatile and unpredictable environment, characterised by geopolitical rivalry, geoeconomic competition, strategic dependencies, competitiveness challenges, the worsening triple planetary crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution, and increasing global fragility. This changing geopolitical landscape and a string of poly-crises have exposed some architectural weaknesses in the design of the external financing instruments.  Simultaneously, the link between EU external and internal policies has become increasingly relevant and is currently not sufficiently catered for – neither in the external nor in the internal financing instruments - and the interplay of external and internal financing instruments is sub-optimal.  As a result, while current external financing instruments are effective in delivering on their expected results, the changing geopolitical landscape and the era of poly-crises have exposed some architectural weaknesses in their design. Partner country, regional and global contexts evolve rapidly while the split between stand-alone pre-programmed and pre-earmarked instruments is not conducive to swift adaptation. Different strands of external action financing are currently fragmented into different financing instruments. The financial and operational barriers between different instruments hamper synergic approaches at the regional level (i.e. humanitarian-development-peace nexus), flexibility in reacting to evolving priorities and interplay between the Enlargement and Neighbourhood policies. There are therefore gains to be made, in terms of overall synergy and flexibility, in ensuring a common source of funding for most of the Union external action instruments, while preserving the capacity of the Union to conduct a principled humanitarian aid policy under Article 214 TFEU. While the budget to finance the Union’s humanitarian aid operations should be made available under this Instrument, such operations should therefore continue to be implemented in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/96.  Lastly, the Communication on ‘the road to the next multiannual financial framework’ strives for external action financing that is better aligned with the EU’s strategic interests. However, the existing toolbox (intervention modalities) is not sufficient to advance them.  1.5.4. Compatibility with the multiannual financial framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments  When implementing this Regulation, consistency with other areas of external action and with other relevant EU policies will be ensured, together with policy coherence for development. As incorporated in the 2030 Agenda, this means taking into account the impact of all policies on sustainable development at all levels — nationally, within the EU, in other countries and at global level.  The Regulation is enabling in nature, which allows it to cater for different policy objectives in synergy with other Union policies. Moreover, synergies with actions under other EU programmes should be sought, in order to maximise the impact of combined interventions. In particular, articulation with the European Competitiveness Fund will be crucial to take various work streams (e.g. critical raw materials and related value chains, economic security and the Clean Industrial Deal) to the next level. Synergies with the Union’s strategic interests is strenghtened also by the updated toolbox. Finally, the implementation of this Regulation will be monitored and evaluated through the performance framework for the post-2027 MFF, ensuring increased coherence between different Union programmes in monitoring and evaluation.  1.5.5.

Comments  External expenditure requires the ability to use all foreseen management modes as relevant and decided during the implementation.  MANAGEMENT MEASURES  2.1. Monitoring and reporting rules  An implementation report will be published by the Commission no later than four years after the start of the programme’s implementation, in order to assess the progress made towards the achievement of their objectives, in line with Regulation (EU, Euratom) [XXX] [Performance Regulation]. A retrospective evaluation will be carried out by the Commission at the latest three years after the end of the MFF period with a view to assessing the effectiveness, efficiency, relevance, coherence and Union added value of the programme.  2.2. Management and control system(s)  2.2.1. Justification of the budget implementation method(s), the funding implementation mechanism(s), the payment modalities and the control strategy proposed  Budget implementation methods  Regarding the management modes, there are no fundamental changes foreseen and the experience acquired by the Commission services and implementing actors under the predecessor programmes will contribute to better results in the future.  The actions to be financed under this Regulation will be implemented under direct management by the Commission from headquarters and/or through the Union delegations and under indirect management by any of the entities listed in article 62(1)(c) of the Financial Regulation in order to better achieve the objectives of the Regulation.  Concerning indirect management, as stated in Article 157 of the Financial Regulation, the Commission must ensure a level of protection of the EU’s financial interests equivalent to the one under direct management. An ex ante pillar assessment of the entities' systems and procedures will be carried out, in accordance with the principle of proportionality and with due consideration for the nature of the action and the financial risks involved. Where the implementation requires so or there have been reservations expressed in Annual Activities Reports, action plans with specific mitigation measures will be defined and implemented. Additionally, appropriate supervisory measures imposed by the Commission may accompany the implementation.  Budget support will also be used.  Innovative financial instruments including in partnership with the European Investment Bank (EIB), Member States’ financial institutions and other international financial institutions will be used for blending activities. The possibility to use trust funds continues to be enabled by the Financial Regulation.  The internal control and management process is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of objectives in the effectiveness and efficiency of the operations, the reliability of the financial reporting and compliance with the relevant legislative and procedural framework.  Effectiveness and efficiency  To ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of the operations (and to mitigate the high level of risk in the external assistance environment), in addition to all the elements of the Commission wide strategic policy and planning process, internal audit environment and other requirements of the Commission's Internal Control Framework, the implementing services will continue to have a tailored aid management framework in operation under all the instruments which will include:  –   A devolved management of the majority of external assistance by Union delegations in the field.  –   Clear and formalised lines of financial accountability (from the Delegated Authorising officer (Director General)) by means of a sub-delegation from the Sub-delegated Authorising Officer (Director) at headquarters to the Head of Delegation;  –   Regular reporting from Union Delegations to Headquarters, including an annual Statement of Assurance by the Head of Delegation;  –   Provision of a substantial programme of training for staff both at headquarters and in delegations,  –   Significant Headquarters/Delegation support and guidance (including via internet);  –   Regular supervision missions to Delegations every 3 to 6 years;  –   A project and programme cycle management methodology including: quality support tools for the design of the intervention, the delivery method, financing mechanism, management system, assessment and selection of any implementing partners, etc.; programme and project management, monitoring and reporting tools for effective implementation including regular external on-the-spot monitoring of projects; and significant evaluation and audit components. Simplifications will be sought by extending, where appropriate and feasible, the use of simplified cost options. There will be a continuation of a risk-differentiated controls approach in accordance with the underlying risks.  Financial Reporting and Accounting  The implementing services will continue to pursue the highest standards of accounting and financial reporting using the Commission's corporate financial system (SUMMA) as well as external aid specific tools such OPSYS.  In relation to compliance with the relevant legislative and procedural framework, compliance control methods are set out in section 2.3 (measures to prevent fraud and irregularities).  2.2.2. Information concerning the risks identified and the internal control system(s) set up to mitigate them  The operational environment of cooperation under this instrument is characterised by the risks of not achieving the instrument's objectives, sub-optimal financial management and/or of not complying with the applicable rules (legality and regularity errors) related to:  – Economic and political instability and natural disaster s and extreme climatic events that may lead to difficulties and delays in the design and implementation of interventions, particularly in fragile states;  – l imited institutional and administrative capacity in partner countries that may lead to difficulties and delays in the design and implementation of interventions;  – geographically dispersed interventions (covering approximately many states , territories and regions) may pose logistical and resource challenges to monitoring - particularly any 'on-the-spot' follow-up of activities;  – diversity of potential partners or beneficiaries with their diverse internal control structures and capacities can fragment and therefore reduce the effectiveness and efficiency of the Commission's available resources to support and monitor implementation;  – limited availab ility of qualititative and quantitative data on the outcomes and impact of external assistance implementation in partner countries may hinder the Commission's ability to report on and be accountable for results.  In order to deal with the risk of financial errors, the Commission will perform the appropriate ex ante and ex post controls. When possible and applicable the performance of systems audits will work as a tool to identify root causes of errors in the entities’ control systems and trigger the necessary mitigating measures.  Moreover, to strengthen its effectiveness in preventing errors, management deficiencies and irregulairies, the Commission is setting up a system for an ongoing targeted risk assessment at contract and at entity level. Key factors increasing the likelihood of a high error rate and a negative impact on sound financial management, in particular linked also to historical data of previous controls and monitoring haven been identified and aggregated in a risk profiling dashboard. The dashboard will provide an important tool to target more effectively future controls, monitoring efforts and other means of mitigation to sensibly reduce the risks of errors, management deficiencies and irregularities.  Given the high risk environment, the systems need to anticipate a significant occurrence of potential compliance errors in transactions and build in a high level of prevention, detection and correction controls as early as possible, before or during, in the payment process. This means in practice that compliance controls will place most reliance on significant ex-ante checks on a multi-annual basis by both external auditors and Commission staff in the field before final project payments (while still executing some ex-post audits), going well beyond the financial safeguards required by the Financial Regulation. This framework include:  – Ex-ante transaction checks performed by Commission staff;  – Audits and verifications (both mandatory and risk based) including the European Court of Auditors;  – Retrospective checks (on a risk basis) and recoveries;  2.2.3. Estimation and justification of the cost-effectiveness of the controls (ratio between the control costs and the value of the related funds managed), and assessment of the expected levels of risk of error (at payment & at closure)  The internal control/management costs planned for the overall (operational + administrative) commitments on the expenditure portfolio financed by the General Budget of the EU for the period 2028-2034 refers only to the costs of the Commission, excluding Member States or entrusted entities. Entrusted entities can withhold up to 7 % for the administration of funds, which could partially be used for control purposes. These management costs take into account all staff at headquarters and in delegations, infrastructure, travel, training, monitoring, evaluation and audit contracts (including those launched by beneficiaries).  While improvements in the nature and targeting of management activities and compliance checks in relation to the portfolio will continue to be pursued, these costs are globally necessary to effectively and efficiently achieve the objectives of the instruments at a minimal risk of non compliance (below 2% residual error). They are significantly less than risks involved in removing or scaling back internal controls in this high risk area.  The compliance objective for the Instrument is on one side to maintain the historic level of risk of non-compliance (error rate) and on the other to at less than 2% the residual 'net' level of error (on a multi-annual basis after all planned controls and corrections have been executed on closed contracts). Where weaknesses are identified, targeted corrective measures will be implemented in the light of ensuring minimum error rates.  2.3. Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities  There are no fundamental changes foreseen in the measures to prevent fraud and irregularities, and the experience acquired by the Commission services and implementing actors under the predecessor programmes will contribute to better results in the future. The Compliance framework is made up inter alia of the following significant components:  Preventative measures  – Compulsory core training covering fraud issues for aid management staff and auditors;  – Provision of guidance (including via internet) including existing manual of procedures such as the Companion, PRAG and the Financial Management Toolkit (for implementing partners);  – Ex-ante assessment to ensure that appropriate anti-fraud measures to prevent and detect fraud in the management of Union funds are in place in the authorities managing the relevant funds under joint and decentralised management);  – Ex-ante screening of the anti-fraud mechanisms available in the partner country as part of the assessment of the eligibility criterion of public finance management for receiving budget support (i.e. active commitment to fight fraud and corruption, adequate inspection authorities, sufficient judicial capacity and efficient response and sanction mechanisms);  – Effective anti-fraud mechanisms to prevent and detect fraud, corruption, and other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Union, including cyber-attacks, particularly in relation to new financial instruments such as blending, financing not linked to cost (FNLC), and/or budgetary guarantees, using digital tools and technologies .  Detective and corrective measures  – Suspension of EU funding where there is a serious fraud case, including large scale corruption, until the authorities have taken appropriate action with a view to correcting and preventing such fraud in the future;  – EDES (Early Detection Exclusion System);  – Suspension/termination of contract;  – Exclusion procedure.  Anti-fraud strategies of the services concerned, aligned with the objectives and priorities of the Commission's anti-fraud strategy (CAFS) and its corresponding Action Plan ensures that the systems used for spending EU funds in third countries enable relevant data to be retrieved with a view to feeding this data into fraud risk assessment and management (e.g. double funding, inflation of costs, rigged tender procedures, conflict of interest, collusion); and wherever necessary, networking groups and adequate IT/digital tools aimed at early detection and prevention of fraud risks and fraud cases related to the external aid sector could be set up.  3.

This initiative is designed to address the challenges posed by a rapidly changing global environment, including geopolitical instability, economic challenges, and environmental concerns. The proposal's main goals are to promote EU values and strategic interests worldwide, address global challenges, and support sustainable development.

To achieve these objectives, the proposal consolidates various financial instruments into a single main tool, governed by a unified performance regulation to oversee monitoring, reporting, and evaluation. This consolidation aims to simplify the EU's external action architecture, ensuring coherence by aligning geographical focus and consistency between internal and external programs. Additionally, the framework enhances flexibility through financial mechanisms that allow for easier budgetary adjustments, thereby increasing the impact of EU actions by streamlining processes and promoting European interests more effectively.

A key component of the framework is the Investment Board, which includes representatives from the European Commission, the High Representative, all Member States, and the European Investment Bank (EIB). The European Parliament will have observer status, and other stakeholders may be given observer status where appropriate. The Board will be co-chaired by the Commission and the High Representative, ensuring a coordinated approach to investment decisions.

The proposal emphasizes promoting human rights, democracy, and the rule of law, with specific attention to protecting the most vulnerable, including efforts against corruption and organized crime. It also focuses",

CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  Regulation (EU) 2019/ 1242 1 sets CO 2 emission performance standards for new heavy-duty vehicles. It is a key contribution to achieve the objectives set in the EU climate law, including the 2050 climate neutrality and the 2030 target to reduce economy-wide CO 2 emissions by 55% compared to 1990.  The automotive industry is of key importance for the EU economy and accounts for over 7% of the EU's GDP. It provides jobs - directly or indirectly, in manufacturing, sales, maintenance, construction and transport services - to around 13 million Europeans. The automotive sector is undergoing a structural transformation including changes in clean and digital technologies. The CO 2 standards provide long-term certainty and predictability for investors along the value chain, therefore enabling such sectoral transformation, while allowing sufficient lead time for a fair transition towards zero-emission vehicles.  The regulation requires that the annual EU fleet-wide average CO 2 emissions from new heavy-duty vehicles are reduced in five-year intervals. In 2025, a target of 15% reduction of CO 2 compared to 2019 values starts applying in each reporting period for the 2025–2029 period for heavy lorries with a technically permissible maximum laden mass (TPMLM) greater than 16 t. This is followed by a CO 2 reduction target for a wider group of heavy-duty vehicles, including lorries with TPMLM > 5t and buses with TPMLM > 7,5 t of 43% applicable as from 2030 onwards. The latter target effectively requires a significant share of zero-emission (e.g. battery electric) vehicles amongst the registered new vehicles of a manufacturer.  Each year, the average CO 2 emissions and the specific CO 2 emissions target for each manufacturer are established, based on the EU fleet-wide target, in order to evaluate the manufacturers’ performance in complying with their targets.  Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 allows manufacturers to collect emission credits if their specific CO 2 emissions are below the CO 2 emissions reduction trajectory, which is a linear trajectory between the targets applicable at the beginning of two subsequent 5-years periods. These emission credits can then be used for compliance at a later stage.  This targeted amendment provides manufacturers with an additional flexibility on CO 2 targets, allowing them to collect more emission credits in the years before 2030. It would facilitate compliance in the period as of 2030, while maintaining the targets for reducing CO 2 emissions. Further possible modifications of this Regulation are entirely outside of the scope and aims of the present proposal. The need for such modifications may be assessed, as appropriate, in the context of the upcoming review of the Regulation. To maintain regulatory certainty and predictability, it is essential that this additional flexibility is agreed between the European Parliament and Council swiftly and without delay. The Commission will constructively engage with the co-legislators, in order to ensure that the legislative process on the present proposal fully preserves its essential object and does not distort it.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  This proposal does not amend the substantive rules of Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 and it maintains the targets. The proposal responds to concerns expressed in the EU by the automotive sector, by providing an additional flexibility for manufacturers to comply with the objectives of the Regulation.  • Consistency with other Union policies  The European Climate Law Regulation 2 establishes the framework for achieving climate neutrality within the EU by 2050. The regulation requires the reduction of net EU greenhouse-gas emissions by at least 55% (compared to 1990 levels) by 2030. In line with the EU Climate Law reduction targets, Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 sets emission reduction targets for heavy-duty vehicles.  The Commission also proposed an amendment to the European Climate Law that enshrines the 2040 target of 90% reduction. Both Council and the European Parliament have established their positions on the file, which is currently in co-decision.  The current proposal does not change the CO 2 emission reduction targets and does not lower the overall CO 2 emission standards ambitions. It introduces an additional flexibility for heavy-duty vehicle manufacturers to comply with the 2030 emission reduction targets, while keeping the certainty and predictability for investors along the value chain.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  The legal basis for this proposal is Article 192 of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). In accordance with Article 191 and 192(1) TFEU, the European Union shall contribute to the pursuit, inter alia, of the following objectives: preserving, protecting and improving the quality of the environment; promoting measures at international level to deal with regional or worldwide environmental problems, and in particular combating climate change. Based on Article 192 of the TFEU, the Union has already adopted policies to address CO 2 emissions from heavy-duty in Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 and its first amendment through Regulation (EU) 2024/1610 3 .  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  This initiative is consistent with the principle of subsidiarity. Amendment of Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 to provide this additional flexibility cannot be achieved by the Member States themselves.  • Proportionality  The proposal is consistent with the principle of proportionality, because it does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the Union’s objectives of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in a cost-effective manner, while providing vehicles manufacturers with an additional flexibility for their compliance while maintaining the level of ambition of the targets.  • Choice of the instrument  The proposal amends Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 only as regards providing an additional flexibility on the compliance periods. Thus, it should follow the same form of act, i.e. a regulation.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  No evaluation is necessary for the proposal, since it only provides for a temporary flexibility for vehicles manufacturers to comply with the 2030 CO 2 emission reduction targets.  • Stakeholder consultations  The Commission held intense and extensive discussions with manufacturers and stakeholders from the automotive value chain in bilateral meetings and in the context of high-level meetings on heavy-duty vehicles, which took place in Q3 and Q4 of 2025.  • Collection and use of expertise  The proposal has been elaborated following a process of internal scrutiny of existing obligations and is based on experience in implementing the related legislation, including the annual monitoring process of manufacturers’ CO 2 compliance.  • Impact assessment  The proposal concerns targeted changes of Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 to provide manufacturers with an additional temporary flexibility as regards their compliance obligations. It does not change the level of ambition of the targets. Therefore no impact assessment was performed.  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  Compared to the current Regulation, the proposal is not expected to increase administrative costs. In addition, it is not increasing the complexity of the legal framework.  • Fundamental rights  The proposal respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union 4 . In particular, it contributes to the objective of a high level of environmental protection in accordance with the principle of sustainable development as laid down in Article 37 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  The legislative financial statement setting out the implications for budgetary, human and administrative resources was attached to the proposal which led to the adoption of Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 and its latest revision by Regulation (EU) 2024/1610.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  This proposal does not change the substance of the rules, the implementation assessment remains the same as of the proposal which led to the adoption of Regulation (EU) 2019/1242, as amended by Regulation (EU) 2024/1610.  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  Article 1(1) of this Regulation amends:  · Article 7(1)(a) of Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 in order to specify the revised rules for determining the emission credits;  · Annex I of Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 in order to introduce the necessary formulas in Annex I point 5.2, implementing the amendment to Article 7(1)(a).  2025/0423 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 as regards the calculation of emission credits for heavy-duty vehicles for the reporting periods of the years 2025 to 2029  (Text with EEA relevance)  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192(1) thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 5 ,  Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions 6 ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 of the European Parliament and of the Council 7 sets out the CO 2 targets for new heavy-duty vehicles, that form a key part of the Union framework to reduce by 2030 net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 % below 1990 levels and reach economy-wide climate-neutrality by 2050.  (2) Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 sets progressively stricter CO 2 emission reduction targets for manufacturers. Those reduction targets provide long-term certainty and predictability for investors along the value chain, while allowing sufficient lead time for a fair transition. It is therefore essential to keep the level of the CO 2 emissions reduction targets established under Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 unchanged.  (3) In order to facilitate compliance with the targets applicable as of 2030, in consideration of the delay in the deployment of the public charging infrastructure along motorways for heavy-duty vehicles, the manufacturers should be able to generate more emission credits before 2030, which may also incentivise earlier deployment of zero-emission heavy-duty vehicles .  (4) Therefore, it is appropriate that only during the reporting periods of the years 2025 to 2029 manufacturers should collect emission credits if their specific CO 2 emissions are below the specific CO 2 emissions target rather than below the CO 2 emissions reduction trajectory.  (5) Taking into account that deployment of zero-emission urban buses is already advanced and their use is not negatively affected by a possible lack of development of the public charging infrastructure along motorways , t his amendment should not apply to urban buses .  (6) Since the objectives of this Regulation to provide vehicles manufacturers with an additional flexibility for their compliance while maintaining the level of ambition of the CO 2 reduction targets cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States , but can rather, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives .  (7) Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 should therefore be amended accordingly,  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Article 1  Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 is amended as follows:  (1) In Article 7(1) , point (a) is amended as follows:  “(a) the difference between the CO 2 emissions reduction trajectory as referred to in paragraph 2 for the reporting period of the year 2025 and the average specific CO 2 emissions of that manufacturer for the reporting periods of the years from 2025 to 2029; and the difference between the CO 2 emissions reduction trajectory for reporting periods of years other than from 2025 to 2029 and the average specific CO 2 emissions of that manufacturer for the same reporting period; if that difference is positive (‘emission credits’); or”  (2) Annex I is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.  Article 2  This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union .  This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.

FRAMEWORK OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE  1.1. Title of the proposal/initiative  Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 to include an additional flexibility for manufacturers of new heavy-duty vehicles as regards the calculation of emission credits in the reporting periods of the years 2025 to 2029  1.2. Policy area(s) concerned  Climate policy  1.3. Objective(s)  1.3.1. General objective(s)  The CO 2 standards provide long-term certainty and predictability for investors along the automotive value chain, while allowing sufficient lead time for a fair transition. The amending proposal aims at providing additional flexibility for manufacturers to comply with the 2030 CO 2 target, while leaving the level of ambition unchanged.  1.3.2. Specific objective(s)  The proposal concerns targeted changes of the CO 2 heavy-duty vehicle Regulation to provide manufacturers with an additional flexibility: it provides for the possibility to collect more emission credits in the years before 2030, which then can be used for compliance in the years after.  1.3.3. Expected result(s) and impact  Specify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.  The amendment, if adopted, would determine that during the reporting periods of the years 2025 to 2029 manufacturers shall collect emission credits if their specific CO 2 emissions are below the CO 2 targets rather than below the emissions reduction trajectory.  1.3.4. Indicators of performance  Specify the indicators for monitoring progress and achievements.  Monitor the CO 2 compliance of manufacturers in the period 2025 - 2030.  1.4. The proposal/initiative relates to:   a new action   a new action following a pilot project / preparatory action 8   the extension of an existing action   a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action  1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative  1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative  The amending proposal aims at providing additional flexibility for manufacturers to comply with the CO 2 targets, while maintaining overall ambition on the CO 2 reduction targets over the period 2025-2040.  1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, greater effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this section 'added value of EU involvement' is the value resulting from EU action, that is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.  Climate change is a trans-boundary problem, which cannot be solved by national or local action alone. Coordination of climate action must be taken at European level  and EU action is justified on grounds of subsidiarity. Given the need to modify Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 by providing an additional flexibility as regards the compliance periods, the objectives of this initiative cannot be achieved by the Member States themselves.  1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past  The proposal builds on existing legislation which will ensuree continuous reductions in the CO 2 emissions of the EU fleet of new heavy-duty vehciles.  1.5.4. Compatibility with the multiannual financial framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments  No additional resources required.  1.5.5. Assessment of the different available financing options, including scope for redeployment  No additional resources required.  1.6. Duration of the proposal/initiative and of its financial impact   limited duration  –  in effect from [DD/MM]YYYY to [DD/MM]YYYY  –  financial impact from YYYY to YYYY for commitment appropriations and from YYYY to YYYY for payment appropriations.   unlimited duration  – Implementation with a start-up period from YYYY to YYYY,  – followed by full-scale operation.  1.7. Method(s) of budget implementation planned 9   Direct management by the Commission  –  by its departments, including by its staff in the Union delegations;  –  by the executive agencies   Shared management with the Member States   Indirect management by entrusting budget implementation tasks to:  –  third countries or the bodies they have designated  –  international organisations and their agencies (to be specified)  –  the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund  –  bodies referred to in Articles 70 and 71 of the Financial Regulation  –  public law bodies  –  bodies governed by private law with a public service mission to the extent that they are provided with adequate financial guarantees  –  bodies governed by the private law of a Member State that are entrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership and that are provided with adequate financial guarantees  –  bodies or persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in the common foreign and security policy pursuant to Title V of the Treaty on European Union, and identified in the relevant basic act  –   bodies established in a Member State, governed by the private law of a Member State or Union law and eligible to be entrusted, in accordance with sector-specific rules, with the implementation of Union funds or budgetary guarantees, to the extent that such bodies are controlled by public law bodies or by bodies governed by private law with a public service mission, and are provided with adequate financial guarantees in the form of joint and several liability by the controlling bodies or equivalent financial guarantees and which may be, for each action, limited to the maximum amount of the Union support.  Comments  No additional resources required.  2. MANAGEMENT MEASURES  2.1. Monitoring and reporting rules  No change to the monitoring and reporting rules is introduced, since the current system also allows to monitor the application of the proposed additional fexibility.  2.2. Management and control system(s)  2.2.1. Justification of the budget implementation method(s), the funding implementation mechanism(s), the payment modalities and the control strategy proposed  The proposal is not implementing a financial programme but introducing an additional flexibility in terms of compliance by the heavy-duty vehicles manufacturers with CO 2 emissions targets. Management mode, funding implementation mechanisms, payment modalities and control strategy in relation to error rates are not applicable.  2.2.2. Information concerning the risks identified and the internal control system(s) set up to mitigate them  This proposal does not concern a spending programme. Efficient monitoring of vehicle registration data is essential for ensuring legal certainty in enforcing the legislation and for ensuring level playing field between different manufacturers.  2.2.3. Estimation and justification of the cost-effectiveness of the controls (ratio between the control costs  and the value of the related funds managed), and assessment of the expected levels of risk of error (at payment & at closure)  This initiative does not bring about new significant controls/risks that would not be covered be an existing internal control framework. No specific measures beyond the application of the Financial Regulation have been envisaged.  2.3. Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities  In addition to the application of the Financial Regulation to prevent fraud and irregularities, the additional flexibility for compliance with the CO 2 reduction requirements provided for in this proposal will be accompanied by monitoring and reporting of different datasets as provided for in Regulation (EU) 2019/1242.  3.

CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  The Critical Raw Materials Act (Regulation (EC) No 2024/1252) provided the EU with the objectives and a first set of tools to ensure that the EU industry has access to a secure and sustainable supply of the critical raw materials (CRMs). CRMs are needed to manufacture the strategic technologies crucial for the clean and digital transition, as well as for defence and aerospace applications. Yet, since the CRMA’s entry into force on 23 May 2024, the geopolitisation of critical raw materials supply has been heightened by a series of Chinese export restrictions on rare earths elements and other critical raw materials. In parallel, other global players have stepped up action to secure access to CRMs for their industries by financing CRM projects and diversifying their supplies through partnerships.  It is within that context that the Commission has adopted on 3 Decembre 2025 the R ES ourceEU a ction p lan to accelerate the achievement of the CRMA and reinforce the European Economic Security Communication 1 . The Action Plan contains measures on the financial de-risking and regulatory support for CRM projects with immediate diversification potential, as well as measures to operationalise its partnerships with third countries, protect the Single Market , and create a lasting market for divers if ied supplies of critical raw materials . Among the measures to meet those objectives , the Commission is proposing targeted amendments to Regulation (EC) No 2024/ 1252 (the Critical Raw Materials Act or “CRMA ”) in order to streamline, clarify and simplify some of the rules to improve circularity, in order to increase recycling capacity and to strenghten the secondary market for critical raw materials.  Firstly, the proposed amendments to the CRMA aim to create a lasting market for the Union’s raw materials value chain. For that purpose, the amendments seek to strenghten the resilience of Union industrial sectors manufacturing strategic technological products with strategic raw materials, a subset of CRMs. The ongoing implementation of the CRMA underlines that there is a risk of fragmentation of the Single Market from disparate identification by individual Member States of the large companies that have to perform risk assessment of their supply chains under Article 24 of the CRMA. This risk of fragmentation demonstrates that, when market failures lead to where companies fail to undertake mitigation strategies to limit their vulnerabilities, additional action may be warranted by the Commission. In addition to incentivising companies to invest in the resilience of their supply chains, these amendments would also drive the demand for diversified CRM supply sources.  Secondly, the imminent need to quickly increase production of CRMs require s the expansion of the circularity framework to increase the recovery and the reuse of critical raw materials , pa r ticularly for rare earth permanent magnets 2 . The Commission therefore proposes to amend the CRMA by expanding the scope of products covered by labelling and clarifying information obligations under Article 28  CRMA . For the same reasons, the Commission is also proposing to include pre-consumer waste to the recycled content obligation for rare earths permanent magnets , also in light of the fact that pre-consumeer waste is more easily recycled and currently more accessible tha n post-consumer waste.  Lastly, the Commission is proposing to introduce addition al flexibility in the number of calls required per calendar year , g iven the high number of applications per call and the need to ensure a coherent assessment of each application . This proposal is based on the Commission ’s implementation of the Article 7 of the CRMA on the selection of Strategic Projects. A first call was opened in 2024, leading to the selection of 47 Strategic Projects in the EU and 13 Strategic Projects outside of the Union 3 . A second call was launched by the Commission on 25 September 2025.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  The amendments contained in this proposal will ensure resource efficiency and support the secure and sustainable supply of CRMs. It will in particular strengthen the Union’s strategic autonomy by securing and ensuring the diversification of its supply chains. The RESourceEU Action Plan initiative reinforces other measures to advance the Union’s industrial and economic security policy goals and contributes to the objectives set out in the Communication on the Clean Industrial Deal and is closely linked to the European Economic Security Doctrine.  At the same time, the amendments will support the clean and digital transformation, by ensuring availability of essential resources used by industries of various sectors. The amendments will improve traceabilityto support end-of-life recovery and promoting the gradual uptake of recycled raw materials, thereby contributing to a coherent and aligned framework for enhancing circularity and securing the Union’s supply of CRMs.  • Consistency with other Union policies  This proposal is consistent and ensures complementarity and synergies with other Union policies.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  In line with Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the proposed regulation aims to contribute to the well-functioning of the Single Market, notably by strenghtening and clarifying the rules ensuring a secure and sustainable supply of CRMs for the Union.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  The overall objective of the proposal is to ensure uniformity and streamline certain procedures at Union level, in order to prepare large companies operating in one or more Member States, to face in the supply chains disruptions and have mitigations measures in place.  The objectives of this proposal cannot be achieved by the action of Member States alone.  • Proportionality  The proposal complies with the proportionality principle in that it does not go beyond the minimum required to achieve the stated objectives at the Union level and which is necessary for that purpose.  • Choice of the instrument  A regulation amending the CRMA Regulation is an appropriate legal instrument to implement the RESourceEU objectives.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  N/A  • Stakeholder consultations  While no formal stakeholder consultation was carried out, the proposed amendments result from technical workshops with representatives of the entire permanent magnets value chain, exchanges within the framework of the CRM Board, as well as the technical work undertaken by the Joint Research Centre in preparation for the secondary legislation under Articles 28 and 29 of the CRMA.  • Collection and use of expertise  Due to the nature of the proposed amendments and the urgency, there was no collection and use of expertise for this proposal.  • Impact assessment  Due to the urgent nature of the proposal, no impact assessment was carried out.  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  N/A  • Fundamental rights  This proposal does not have consequences for the protection of fundamental rights.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  The proposal does not have implications for the Union budget.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  This proposal amends the CRMA and includes changes to the implementation plans for Member States, in particular by removing the obligation for Member States to identify large companies and transferring this obligation to the Commission. This change simplifies and streamlines administrative procedures at Union level.  The obligations and reporting arrangements for certain companies are clarified through targeted changes to a very limited number of articles.  • Explanatory documents (for directives)  N/A  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  Article 1 amends Regulation (EU) 2024/1252.  Article 1, point (1) modifies the number of cut-off dates for open calls for applications for Strategic projects under the CRMA.  Article 1, point (2)(a), streamlines the obligation to identify large companies by tansferring it from national administrations to the Commission.  Article 1, point (2)(b) requires the Commission to notify large companies of their obligations.  Article 1, point (2)(c) clarifies the obligation for large companies and the aspects to consider for their risk preparedness assessment.  Article 1, point (2)(d) clarifies the obligations that large companies need to comply with for the mitigation measures  Article 1, point (2)(e) strengthens the obligation for large companies to maintain their board informed of the risk assessment.  Article 1, point (2)(f) allows the Commission to request information from large companies on their compliance with the risk assessment obligations, and empowers the Commission to specify if needed the mitigations measures for large companies through delegated acts.  Article 1, point (2)(g) deletes a paragraph that is not adapted anymore since the obligations under article 28 CRMA are placed on the Commission.  Article 1, point (3) expands the list of products containg permanent magnets to be considered by the Commission for their labeling.  Article 1, point (4) clarifies and expands the scope of Article 29 CRMA by including pre-consummer waste of permanent magnets to enable more comprehensive action by the Commission is more comprehensive for recycling permanent magnets.  Article 1, point (5) adapts the rules for the exercise of the delegation to include the new empowerment under Article 1, point (2)(f).  2025/0385 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulation (EU) 2024/1252  (Text with EEA relevance)  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114, thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 4 ,  Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions 5 ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) Since the entry into force of Regulation (EU) 2024/1252 on 23 May 2024, the Commission has been collectin g data and information from stakeholders and Member States concerning the implementation of it .  (2) Access to secure and sustainable c ritical raw materials is essential for the Union’s objectives of clean and digital transition as set out in the Clean Industrial Deal 6 . They are also essential components for the Union’s industries, in all areas including defence . Due to the current geopoliti cal situation the Union’s supply and security of critical raw materials is put at risk and therefore, the current framework should be strengthened.  (3) Under Regulation (EU) 2024/1252, the Commission is required to set up calls for application for Strategic Projects with at least four cut-off dates per year. Given the high number of applications for recognition of Strategic Project under each call per call received for the identification of Strategic projects of strategic critical raw material projects and to ensure a better assessment of the various applications, it should be possible for the Commission to limit the number of such calls per year.  (4) Under Regulation (EU) 2024/1252 , Member States are required to identify large companies by May 2025 and within 12 months of each update of the list of strategic raw materials pursuant to Article 3(3) . Nevertheless, large companies that use critical raw materials can operate in more than one Member State. To avoid a duplication of the identification of these large companies by the various national administrations and to prevent a risk of fragmentation of the Single Market, it should be for the Commission to identify these large companies operating in the Union.  (5) It is essential to strengthen the risk preparedness of the large companies that are identified by the Commission, i t is essential that their obligations are strengthen ed , and therefore large companies should be requir ed to take measures to mitigate their vulnerabilities, including by diversifying their raw material supply chain . The Commission should be able to receive the information regarding their compliance necessary for an effective monitoring and ensure they are prep ared in case of supply disruptio n. T he Commission should specify the m itigation measures that large companies should adopt in case of vulnerabilities , it should be able to do so by means of delegated acts.  (6) L arge companies should, as part of that risk assessment, map where the strategic raw materials they use are extracted , processed and recycled from , an d analyse the factors that could affect their supply and assess their vulnerabilities to supply disruptions. In order to have a clear understanding of their vulnerabilities, they should also map the supply chain of the components containing critical raw materials. T o reinforce their preparedness large companies should r eport on th eir risk assessment to the companies’ board of directors or management board .  (7) The Commission should continue to monitor the situation and the risk preparedness of large companies, ensuring their readiness in case of disruption of their supply chains. To that end, and when it decides so, the Commission can request information from large companies on their compliance and mitigation measures as required by this Regulation .  (8) T he recognition of pre-consumer recycled materials complements , the recovery of post-consumer waste by ensuring that manufacturers can improve short-term resource efficiency while maintaining strong incentives to build and expand end-of-life collection and recycling systems. A dditional product categories and pre-consumer waste are therefore essential to improve recycling, strengthen traceability and increase the availability of secondary materials thereby supporting the Union’s overall resource efficiency and security of supply .  (9) To attain the objectives set in the R ES ourceEU Action Plan, Regulation (EU) 2024/1252 should therefore be amended accordingly ,  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Article 1 Amendments to Regulation (EU) 2024/1252  Regulation (EU) 2024/1252 is amended as follows:  (1) i n Article 7 (3) , the second subparagraph is replaced by the following :  ‘The first such cut-off date shall be no later than 24 August 2024. The Commission shall set cut-off dates up to four times per year.’;  (2) Article 24 is amended as follows:  (a) paragraph 1 is replaced by the following:  ‘1.

Article 2 Entry into force  This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union .  This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.  Done at Brussels,  For the European Parliament For the Council  The President The Presiden t",,,,,,,,,,,,,"The European Commission has proposed amendments to the Critical Raw Materials Act (CRMA) to bolster the EU's resilience and sustainability in securing essential raw materials vital for strategic technologies such as clean energy, digital transformation, and defense. This initiative is a response to geopolitical challenges, notably China's export restrictions on rare earth elements and other critical materials, which pose risks to the EU's supply chain stability. The amendments aim to establish a stable market within the EU, enhance industry resilience, and ensure consistent risk assessments across member states to prevent market fragmentation.

Key objectives include expanding the circularity framework to increase the recovery and reuse of critical materials, such as rare earth permanent magnets. This involves broadening product labeling and information obligations and incorporating pre-consumer waste into recycling requirements. The proposal also introduces flexibility in the number of strategic project calls per year, reflecting the high volume of applications and the need for thorough assessments. These changes align with the broader RESourceEU Action Plan, supporting the EU's industrial and economic security goals.

To address significant vulnerabilities to supply disruptions identified through risk assessments, large companies are required to take steps to mitigate these risks, such as diversifying their raw materials supply chains, considering secondary raw materials, or substituting strategic raw materials. These companies must present the results of their risk assessments to their board of directors or management board. The Commission may request explanations from these companies on how they comply with these obligations and can adopt delegated acts to specify risk mitigation measures based on an assessment of supply risks and trade",

investments in the EU budget to implement the ReArm Europe Plan  (Text with EEA relevance)  EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM  1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  President Von der Leyen announced in the Political Guidelines that a new era for defence lies ahead of us. The EU will work in the next five years to build a true European Defence Union. The last decades have exposed a chronic underinvestment and lack of efficient spending in our military capabilities, affecting the production capacities of the European defence technological and industrial base (EDTIB) and its innovation potential, while fragmenting nationally the defence market. To frame this new approach and to identify the EU investment needs, the European Commission and the High Representative presented a Joint White Paper  - European Defence Readiness 2030 on 19 March 2025.  The White Paper highlights that Member States face an acute and growing threat, requiring a coordinated reply in the spirit of solidarity. War, aggression and other hostile acts have been affecting the continent. The only way to ensure peace and deciding on the EU’s own future is to have the readiness to deter these actions. This requires strengthening the Union’s defence industry so that it can produce necessary equipment to deter potential aggressors. The EU has a strong foundation in terms of wealth and productive power to unleash resources and latent technological and industrial power. However, the current state of defence readiness is compromised by decades of under-investment in the sector, underscoring the need for a unified effort to strengthen EU defence posture.  To develop the necessary capabilities and military readiness to credibly deter armed aggression and secure the future of the EU, a massive increase in European defence spending is needed over a prolonged period. This requires a combined and sustained effort at the EU and Member States level to invest collectively in EU’s defence. This will provide the Union’s defence industry the long-term predictability it needs to invest in new production capacities.  The STEP Regulation supports EU’s competitiveness and technological advantage. Support to the development and manufacturing of certain defence technologies is today possible under STEP, including AI, cybersecurity technologies or drones.  However, the EU must do more to support the urgent need to increase European defence investments with the EU budget.  Following President von der Leyen’s letter on 4 March, addressed to the European Council, this proposal aims to extend the scope of STEP by introducing a fourth strategic sector covering all defence-related technologies and products, including those falling under the priority capability areas identified in the White Paper.  STEP could be thus leveraged to direct additional resources and investments into the defence sector, notably its technological and industrial base.  To that end, this proposal introduces modifications to the STEP Regulation, as well as to the regulations of other programmes covered by STEP: the European Defence Fund (EDF), the Digital Europe Programme (DEP) and Horizon Europe (HE). In addition, this proposal will also amend the regulation on supporting ammunition production (ASAP) and the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) to further channel EU funds towards defence industry and technologies.  The EDF amendment aims to enable cumulation of funding between the EDF and other Union programmes for the same action and introduces the possibility to transfer resources allocated to Member States under cohesion policy funds to the EDF. ASAP is also amended to enable for similar transfers from Member States and to extend the applicability of the Regulation beyond 30 June 2025.  The DEP amendment stresses the support to dual-use actions as a general and specific objective of the instrument and the possibility to use the budget flexibility to support additional well focused investments for the competitiveness and strategic autonomy of the EU.  The Horizon Europe programme amendment will enable support to technologies with potential dual-use applications under the European Innovation Council (EIC) Accelerator, as well as equity support for technologies with a focus on defence applications for scale-up. Unused amounts and potential returns from investments made by the EIC Fund during the pilot phase under Horizon 2020 should be made available in order to finance additional projects in dual use and defence benefitting from the amended scope.  Thanks to this proposal, the Commission could also award STEP Seals 1 under HE, EDF and DEP to high potential projects in the d efence sector, with the objective to attract funding from other sources (other EU funds, national funds, private or institutional investors) .  The Commission proposed on 1 April 2025 to modify the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)/Cohesion Fund (CF), Just Transition Fund (JTF) and European Social Fund + (ESF+) Regulations to further promote investments in defence as part of the mid-term review of Cohesion policy.  This proposal complements the mid-term review of Cohesion policy. The extension of the scope of STEP would allow investments on the development and manufacturing of critical technologies in defence to be supported under the existing STEP specific objectives in ERDF and CF. Similarly, skills relevant for the development/manufacturing of critical technologies in the defence sector could be supported also under STEP through the ESF+.  A coordinated approach at EU-level is needed to provide for seamless mobility for military personnel and equipment throughout Europe. CEF, as a centrally managed programme, can ensure the selection of military mobility projects with high EU added value and maturity for a fast and coordinated implementation across Member States, based on the military mobility corridors. CEF also guarantees the involvement of EU Military Staff in the selection of projects and that selected projects comply with the technical standards needed for dual-use transport infrastructure.  The proposal for the mid-term review of the Cohesion policy enables Member States to use current cohesion funding to invest in defence or dual use infrastructure to foster military mobility, benefiting from a pre-financing of 30% of the amounts programmed and the possibility to apply a Union financing of up to 100%. Those investments shall primarily focus on the four EU Priority Military Mobility Corridors. For investments in military mobility, the Communication accompanying the mid-term review of Cohesion policy encourages Member States to make use of the possibility to transfer resources allocated to them in shared management to CEF, while benefitting from the same advantageous pre- and co-financing rates as cohesion funding. An amendment to the CEF Regulation is proposed to facilitate this process.  The CEF programme amendment for the digital sector will enable the connected digital capacities required for the development of defence products and technologies, including connecting cloud, AI and AI Gigafactories.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  The proposal is consistent with the objectives followed by the EU programmes mentioned above and the cohesion policy funds. It provides targeted amendments of Regulations (EU) 2021/694, (EU) 2021/695, (EU) 2021/697, (EU) 2021/1153, (EU) 2023/1525 and (EU) 2024/795.  • Consistency with other Union policies  The proposal is limited to targeted amendments of Regulations (EU) 2021/694, (EU) 2021/695, (EU) 2021/697, (EU) 2021/1153, (EU) 2023/1525 and (EU) 2024/795 and maintains consistency with other Union policies.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  The proposal is based on Articles 114, 164, 172, 173, 175, third paragraph, 176, 177, 178, 182,183, 188, and 192 (1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  The proposal aims to encourage investments in defence by providing incentives, removing potential obstacles and ensuring greater flexibility and simplification. The same result cannot be achieved through actions at national level.  • Proportionality  The proposal aims at mobilising investments in defence and providing greater flexibility and simplification for accelerating investments. The measures do not go beyond what is necessary to achieve these goals.  • Choice of the instrument  A Regulation is the appropriate instrument as it provides directly applicable rules for the support and because amendments have to be introduced to existing Regulations.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  N/A  • Stakeholder consultations  N/A  • Collection and use of expertise  N/A  • Impact assessment  This proposal does not create a new instrument but is implemented through existing tools under the EU budget, which are amended to be able to better mobilise investment resources into defence. These existing instruments, such as Horizon Europe, Digital Europe Programme, the European Defence Fund or Connecting Europe Facility, have been subject to an impact assessment. This analysis, carried out in impact assessments or analytical staff working documents, covers the most significant impacts of this proposal. For these reasons, another impact assessment is not needed. Moreover, the limited and targeted changes do not require a separate impact assessment.  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  N/A  • Fundamental rights  N/A  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  This initiative will be financed by existing resources, within the agreed envelopes of the programmes concerned and the allocated HR.  The proposal will reinforce the envelop of the EIC by EUR 210 million from the unused amounts and reflows of the EIC pilot of Horizon 2020.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  The implementation of the measure will be monitored and reported upon in the framework of the general reporting mechanisms established under each programme and fund.  • Explanatory documents (for directives)  N/A  2025/0103 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulations (EU) 2021/694, (EU) 2021/695, (EU) 2021/697, (EU) 2021/1153, (EU) 2023/1525 and 2024/795, as regards incentivising defence-related investments in the EU budget to implement the ReArm Europe Plan  (Text with EEA relevance)  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 114, 164, 172, 173, Article 175, third paragraph, Articles 176, 177 and 178,182 183, 188, 192(1) thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 2 ,  Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions 3 ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) The unprecedented geopolitical instability and the rapid deterioration of regional and global threat levels require an urgent and significant step up of the Union spending on research and development, industrial capacity and development of infrastructures connected with security and defence. As identified in the Joint White Paper for European Defence Readiness 2030, the Union should do more to support the urgent need to increase European defence -related investments with the Union budget.  (2) The Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (STEP) established by Regulation ( EU) 2024/795 of the European P arliament and of the Council 4 is an initiative aimed at boosting U nion competitiveness by mobilizing funds from 11 existing Union programmes towards critical technologies in 3 strategic sectors: digital technologies and deep tech innovation, clean and resource-efficient technologies, and biotechnologies. As such, it is a good vehicle to mobilise, in a coordinated and synergetic manner, Union resources towards defence , including key digital frontier technologies required for the development of defence products and technologies .  (3) While support to technologies having defence implications is possible today under the 3 existing strategic sectors identified in STEP, it appears necessary to increase the potentialities of development of research, industry and innovation in the defence area by setting out a fourth strategic sector in STEP focussed on defence technologies.  This new strategic sector should ensure that the STEP incentives are used to increase Union funding in defence technologies and contribute to European competitiveness in line with STEP objectives . Defence technologies should be understood as those referred to in the A nnex to Directive 2009/43/EC and include, in particular, technologies in the areas identified by the European Council on March 6 th 2025, namely: air and missile defence , artillery systems, including deep precision strike capabilities , missiles and ammunition , drones and anti-drone systems , strategic enablers, including in relation to space and critical infrastructure protection , military mobility , cyber , artificial intelligence and electronic warfare. As regards artificial intelligence, AI Gigafactories should become key infrastructures to expand rapidly the power of AI in defence technologies.  (4) In addition, in order to optimise the capacity of the programmes covered by STEP to mobilize Union’s resources towards defence, it is necessary to clarify that these programmes can pursue objectives and activities that are related to improving the competitiveness of the European Defence Technological and In d ustrial basis ( EDTIB ) as well as research and development activities in the defence field.  (5) Horizon Europe established by Regulation (EU) 2021/ 695 of the European Parliament and of the Council 5 is the Union’s key funding programme for research and innovation. The European Innovation Council (EIC) Accelerator established by that Regulation provides support, in particular, for innovations with breakthrough potential and of a disruptive nature with scale-up potential that may be too risky for private investors. SMEs operating within the defence sector require financing for the commercialization of innovative products. However, these companies face higher barriers to access finance compared to SMEs in other sectors. Whereas the support to defence research and development is done through the European Defence Fund (EDF), which is a specific programme of Horizon Europe, it is appropriate to open the EIC Accelerator for actions with potential dual-use applications. Support to scale-up under the EIC Accelerator should also be extended to non-bankable SMEs, including start-ups and non-bankable small mid-caps, including entities which have already received support from the Accelerator carrying out breakthrough and disruptive non-bankable innovation with a focus on defence applications. This justifies a targeted exception to the principle set out in Article 7 (1) of Regulation (EU) 2021/695 of the European Parliament and of the Council according to which research and innovation activities under Horizon Europe have an exclusive focus on civil applications while not undermining the objective of ensuring unnecessary duplications.  (6) Moreover, to ensure that appropriate resources are directed to the funding of dual use and defence projects under Horizon Europe it is appropriate to derogate to Article 212(3) of the Financial Regulation in order to ensure that repayments, including reimbursed advances, revenues and unused amounts net of fees and costs of EIC blended finance investment component of the EIC pilot under Horizon 2020 are not directed to the Union budget but reinvested in the EIC Fund in order to finance additional projects in dual use and defence benefitting from the amended scope . The timeframe set out in Article 212(3) of the Financial Regulation should also be adapted, by inserting a derogation, to allow for that possibility.  (7) The European Defence Fund (EDF) set out in Regulation (EU) 2021/697 of the European Parliament and of the Council 6 , is the leading programme for enhancing the competitiveness, innovation, efficiency and technological autonomy of the Union’s defence industry. The EDF also aims at supporting actions that are conducive to developing disruptive technologies for defence. In order to better address the specificities of such actions, such as their small scale or their need for a quick support, it is app r opriate to simplify the procedure s to decide on the support of these actions while in the same time framing the conditions for the decision on such a support in the work programme . .  (8) It is also necessary to exploit synergies between EDF and other Union programmes. To that purpose, it should be possible for Member States, European Union institutions, bodies and agencies, third countries, international financial institutions or other third parties to provide voluntary contributions to the Programme , as external assigned revenues. V oluntary transfers of resources allocated to Member States in shared management to the EDF and the combination of contributions from EDF with other Union programmes for specific actions should be possible, provided that the cumulative Union support does not exceed the total eligible costs of the action.  (9) The Digital Europe Programme (DEP) established by Regulation (EU) 2021/694 of the European Parliament and of the Council 7 aims to support and accelerate the digital transformation of the European economy, industry and society and to improve the competitiveness of Europe in the global digital economy. In this context, the programme should also aim at supporting, in particular, projects, services and competences with potential dual-use application under all its specific objectives .  (10) To enhance technological sovereignty and competitiveness, the Union needs the computing, cloud and data infrastructures that AI leadership requires. As part of the AI Continent strategy, the AI factories and Gigafactories are essential for t he Union to be able to compete on the global level and ensure its strategic autonomy and competitiveness in science , dual use research and in critical industrial sectors, including the defence industry. Such next-generation models require extensive connected computing infrastructure for breakthroughs in specific domains including defence.  It is therefore appropriate to add, in the Specific Objective 1 – High Performance Computing of DEP, a supplementary operational objective dedicated to the deployment and operation of AI Factories and new generation of IA Gigafactories specialised in developing, training, and running the most complex, very large, AI models and applications, including hardware and software necessary for such deployment.  (11) In the specific Objective 5 of DEP – Deployment and Best Use of Digital Capacity and interoperability, it is also necessary to add, in the operational objective defined to support the public sector and areas of public interest, a reference to defence in order to clarify that the financial contribution of the Union under such an Objective can be extended to that sector.  (12) It is also necessary to adapt the eligibility rules that might be set out in the work programme of DEP so that it is possible to provide that legal entities established in associated countries and legal entities that are established in the Union but are controlled from third countries are not eligible to participate in all or some actions focused on technologies with dual-use potential under any specific objective . In such cases, calls for proposals and calls for tenders should be restricted to legal entities established or deemed to be established in Member States and controlled by Member States or by nationals of Member States.  (13) Regulation (EU) 2023 / 1525 of the European Parliament and of the Council supporting ammunition production (ASAP) 8 was adopted to financially support the urgent strengthening of the EDTIB responsiveness and ability to ensure the timely availability and supply of ground-to-ground and artillery ammunition as well as missiles. Voluntary transfers of resources allocated to Member States in shared management to the ASAP instrument as well as additional voluntary contributions from Member States or other relevant stakeholders should contribute to pursue the support to ramping up the Union’s manufacturing capacities beyond 30 June 2025. Regulation (EU) 2023/1525 should therefore be amended to introduce such a possibility. Since that Regulation has shown is usefulness to develop new production capacities of powder/propellant, explosives, shells, testing capacity, and missiles all across the Union, it is appropriate to ensure that its applica tion is extended until 31 December 2026.  (14) The Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) set out in Regulation (EU) 2021/1153 of the European Parliament and of the Council , 9 aims to accelerate investment in the field of trans-European networks, enabling synergies between the transport, energy and digital sectors. In order to support the connected computing infrastructure required by defence products and technologies and beyond these area s , the objectives of the CEF digital sector within that Regulation should be extended to the deployment and provision of digital capacities such as cloud, AI and AI Gigafactories.  (15) Military mobility is also one of the objectives of the CEF programme. The Joint White Paper for European Defence Readiness 2030 recognised military mobility as an essential enabler for European security and defence and stressed the Union added-value in supporting dual-use infrastructure for mobility. The mid-term review of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the Cohesion Fund both established by Regulation (EU) 2021/1058 of the European Parliament and of the Council 10 introduced the possibility to invest in defence or dual use infrastructure to foster military mobility benefiting from a pre-financing of 30% of the amounts programmed and the possibility to apply a Union financing of up to 100%. In case s where Member States transfer resources allocated to them in shared management to CEF they should benefit from the same conditions on pre-financing and co-financing for dual-use transport infrastructure projects as introduced in the ERDF and Cohesion Fund. In such a case, these amounts should be reserved to projects developing the Military Mobility corridors as identified by the Member States in Military Requirements for Military Mobility within and beyond the Union as well as digital connectivity and capacities..  (16) Regulations (EU) 2021/694, (EU) 2021/695, (EU) 2021/697, (EU) 2021/1153, (EU) 2023/1525 and (EU) 2024/795 should therefor e be amended accordingly .  (17) Given the urgent need to enable crucial investments in defence in the context of pressing geopolitical challenges, this Regulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.  (18) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely to strengthen research and development activities in dual use and defence, improve the competitiveness of the Union’s defence industry and therefore contribute to the Union’s defence by refocus ing investments of these critical priorities, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but can rather be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 TEU. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives ,  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Article 1  Regulation (EU) 2021/694 [Digital Europe Programme] is amended as follows:  (1) in Article 3 (1), second subparagraph, the following point is added:  ‘(c) support dual-use projects, services, competences and applications.’;  (2) in Article 4 (1) the following point is added:  ‘(d) deploy and operate AI Factories and new generation AI Gigafactories specialised in developing, training, and running the most complex, very large, AI models and applications, including hardware and software necessary for such deployment.’;  (3) in Article 8 (1),  point (a) is replaced by the following:  ‘(a) support the public sector and areas of public interest, such as health and care, education, judiciary, customs, defence, transport, mobility, energy, environment, cultural and creative sectors, including relevant businesses established within the Union, to effectively deploy and access state-of-the-art digital technologies, such as HPC, quantum, AI and cybersecurity;’;  (4) in Article 12, paragraph 5 is replaced by the following:  ‘5.

In such cases, calls for proposals and calls for tenders shall be restricted to legal entities established or deemed to be established in Member States and controlled by Member States or by nationals of Member States.  Such restrictions may be applied to access to the capacities deployed under such calls.’  Article 2  Regulation (EU) 2021/695 [Horizon Europe] is amended as follows:  (1) In Article 46, the following paragraph 4a is inserted:  ‘4a.

Expected result(s) and impact  Specify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.  The proposed mini-omnibus regulation is expected to have the following effects on the beneficiaries and groups targeted:  Increased investments in defence: the proposal will provide Member States with more flexibility to use the EU budget to address their defence needs, leading to a significant increase in defence investments, in line with the objectives of the ReArm Europe Plan.  Enhanced European defence technological and industrial base (EDTIB): by supporting the development of defence and dual-use technologies, the proposal will enable the EU to reduce its dependence on non-EU suppliers and strengthen its strategic autonomy, ultimately strengthening the EDTIB.  Improved military readiness, capabilities, and mobility: the proposal will enable Member States to meet their defence capability gaps, develop the necessary military readiness to credibly deter armed aggression, and enhance military mobility across the continent, including through the develoment of Military Mobility corridors. The new pre- and co-financing rates for dual-use transport infrastructure projects should serve as incentives for Member States to transfer ressources from shared management to CEF, enabling a coordinated approach to military mobility investments across Member States and contributing to the objectives of the Joint White Paper for European Defence Readiness 2030.  Support to SMEs and start-ups: by opening the European Innovation Council (EIC) Accelerator and EIC Scale Up to dual-use and defence technologies, the proposal will promote innovation and competitiveness in the EU, strengthen the EDTIB, and provide opportunities for SMEs and start-ups to develop and grow.  Increased synergies with other sectors: the proposal will facilitate increased synergies between defence and other sectors, such as digital, by enabling the financing of initiatives like AI Factories and AI Gigafactories, as well asdual-use projects with potential spill-over effects for innovation and competitiveness in areas like research, technology, and industry.  These expected results and impacts will benefit various stakeholders , including:  - Member States, by providing greater flexibility to use EU funding in support of security and defence  - The EU defence industry, including SMEs and start-ups, by providing opportunities for growth and innovation and strengthening the EDTIB.  - EU citizens, by contributing to peace, security and strategic autonomy  1.3.4.

The proposal/initiative relates to:   a new action   a new action following a pilot project / preparatory action 11   the extension of an existing action   a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action  1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative  1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative  The proposal aims to address the need for increased and swift investments in defence and the development of a strong and competitive EDTIB, in line with the ReArm Europe Plan. It aims to introduce changes to existing EU programmes, including STEP, Horizon Europe, EDF, ASAP, DEP, and CEF, to support defence and dual-use initiatives. The targeted amendments to EU Regulations will take effect immediately following the adoption of the proposed Regulation. Where relevant, they should be taken into account for the preparation and/or amendment of existing Work Programmes of relevant initiatives (Horizon Europe, CEF, DEP, STEP, EDF). This will enable the launch of new calls for proposals and the selection of projects that align with the EU and MS defence and security objectives.  Timeline for implementation:  The implementation timeline for the mini-omnibus regulation will be influenced by the existing programme cycles and the need to incorporate the changes into the respective work programmes. For most programmes, the changes are expected to be introduced in the next available work programme, with the first calls for proposals launched shortly thereafter.  For amendments that introduce the possibility for Member States to channel cohesion policy funds towards defence-related investments (including CEF, STEP, EDF, ASAP), in order to benefit from the additional pre-financing of 30% of the amounts programmed, Member States should submit their programme amendments by the end of 2025.  1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, greater effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this section 'added value of EU involvement' is the value resulting from EU action, that is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.  The added value of EU action lies in its ability to coordinate investments, maximise budget efficiency, and achieve greater effectiveness in supporting defence investments than would be possible for any individual Member State acting alone. The EU's role in promoting a coordinated approach to defence investment enables MS to address their defence needs, which is essential for ensuring the security and stability of the EU and its Member States.  Reasons for action at EU level (ex-ante):  – The need for coordinated investment in defence to address common security challenges and threats, which cannot be effectively addressed by individual Member States alone.  – The importance of maximising budget efficiency, maximjising complementarity of different funding programmes and reducing duplication of efforts, which can be achieved through EU-level coordination and cooperation.  Reasons for action at EU level (ex-ante):  – Support defence readiness and enhance military mobility, which will strengthen MS ability to respond to common security challenges and threats.  – Increased competitiveness and innovation in the European defence industry, resulting from the EU's coordinated approach to defence investment and the development of a strong and competitive European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB).  – Maximisation of synergies among different EU financial instruments and enhanced sclae and scope, which will enable the EU to leverage its resources more effectively and achieve greater impact with its investments that individual MS, particularly for large scale projects.  – Better value for money, resulting from the efficient use of resources and reduced duplication of efforts, which will enable the EU to achieve more with its available resources. By combining the resources and expertise of different EU programmes, the EU can create a more comprehensive and integrated approach to defence investment, which will yield greater benefits and returns than could be achieved through individual programmes alone.  1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past  The EU has a track record of successfully adapting its funding instrumentsto respond to emerging challenges and priorities. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the EU introduced several instruments to support the recovery and resilience of affected regions and communities, including the Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative (CRII) and CRII+, as well as REACT-EU (Recovery Assistance for Cohesion and the Territories of Europe). Additionally, in response to the Russia-Ukraine war and the resulting energy price crisis, the EU proposed a more flexible use of its funding instruments to help Member States address various challenges.  These experiences have shown that adapting EU funding instruments can be an effective way to respond to evolving challenges and strategic priorities.. They have also highlighted the importance of close coordination and cooperation between the European Commission, Member States, and relevant authorities to ensure that funds are used effectively and efficiently.  In the context of defence investment, the EU can draw on these lessons to ensure that the adaptation of its funding instruments is done in a way that is transparent, accountable, and effective. By building on these past experiences, the EU can create a more flexible and responsive framework that is better equipped to address the complex and evolving security challenges facing the EU and its Member States.  1.5.4. Compatibility with the multiannual financial framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments  The proposed targeted amendments to the relevant EU Regulations are fully compatible with the existing Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) 2021-2027. The amendments do not requireadditional funding from the EU budget at allnor do they alter  the overall budget allocation for most of the programmes, as they are designed to optimize the use of existing resources within the current programmes. The proposed flexibilities and synergies among different EU financial instruments, such as STEP, EDF, ASAP, CEF, and DEP, are also fully consistent with the existing MFF. However, to achieve the objectives of the mini-omnibus proposal, additional resources originated by reflows from the EIC pilot in the previous MFF under Horizon 2020 will be allocated to Horizon Europe, specifically for the European Innovation Council. This targeted reinforcement will support the development of innovative defence and dual-use technologies, and will be implemented within the existing MFF framework.  The proposed amendments could help inform the future MFF by providing valuable insights and lessons learned from the implementation of the current programmes. The experience gained from the flexibilisation of cohesion funds and the creation of synergies among different EU financial instruments could be taken into account when designing future EU programmes and budget allocations. This could help to ensure that future EU funding is more effective, efficient, and better aligned EU strategic priorities, including defence and security.  1.5.5. Assessment of the different available financing options, including scope for redeployment  The proposed targeted amendments to the relevant EU Regulations offer a range of financing options and opportunities for redeployment, which could help to optimize the use of existing resources and support the development of defence capabilities and technologies in the EU.  One of the financing options is the possibility of channeling cohesion funds to support defence-related investments and activities, e.g. thorugh STEP.  The European Defence Fund (EDF) amendment aims to enable cumulation of funding between the EDF and other Union programmes for the same action, allowing for a more comprehensive and integrated approach to supporting defence-related investments. Additionally, the amendment provides for the possibility to transfer resources allocated to Member States under cohesion policy funds to the EDF, which would enable Member States to redirect their cohesion policy funds to support defence-related investments. Moreover, the ASAP amendment will enable voluntary transfers of resources allocated to Member States under cohesion policy funds to the ASAP instrument, as well as additional voluntary contributions from Member States.  The Digital Europe Programme (DEP) amendment provides for the possibility to use the budget flexibility to support additional well-focused investments for the competitiveness and strategic autonomy of the EU, including dual use.  The Horizon Europe programme amendment will enable support to projects with potential dual-use applications under the European Innovation Council (EIC) Accelerator (grant + equities), as well as projects with a focus on defence applications under the EIC Accelerator scale-up scheme (equity only).  The CEF amendment will enable the connected digital capacities required for the development of defence products and technologies, including connecting cloud, AI, and AI Gigafactories, as well as military mobility. This will support the development of infrastructure and technologies that are essential for security and defence. In CEF, the military mobility envelope (EUR 1.7 billion) has been fully allocated to projects in 2024 after three calls or proposals. Transfers of Member States from resources under shared management are therefore an option to support further military mobility projects under CEF.  1.6.

Method(s) of budget implementation planned 12   Direct management by the Commission  –  by its departments, including by its staff in the Union delegations;  –  by the executive agencies   Shared management with the Member States   Indirect management by entrusting budget implementation tasks to:  –  third countries or the bodies they have designated  –  international organisations and their agencies (to be specified)  –  the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund  –  bodies referred to in Articles 70 and 71 of the Financial Regulation  –  public law bodies  –  bodies governed by private law with a public service mission to the extent that they are provided with adequate financial guarantees  –  bodies governed by the private law of a Member State that are entrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership and that are provided with adequate financial guarantees  –  bodies or persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in the common foreign and security policy pursuant to Title V of the Treaty on European Union, and identified in the relevant basic act  –   bodies established in a Member State, governed by the private law of a Member State or Union law and eligible to be entrusted, in accordance with sector-specific rules, with the implementation of Union funds or budgetary guarantees, to the extent that such bodies are controlled by public law bodies or by bodies governed by private law with a public service mission, and are provided with adequate financial guarantees in the form of joint and several liability by the controlling bodies or equivalent financial guarantees and which may be, for each action, limited to the maximum amount of the Union support.  Comments  The method of budget implementation will depend on the specific programme affected by the amendment. In particular:  For Horizon Europe/EIC Accelerator, implementation is expected to be through executive agencies (notably EISMEA); the EIC Fund is managed by the European Investment Bank.  For STEP, CEF, DEP, EDF, and ASAP, direct management is foreseen.  For CEF, the programme is implemented through direct management and fully delegated to the European Climate, Infrastructure and Environment Executive Agency (CINEA). Some programme support actions are managed directly by the Commission  For Cohesion Policy, shared management with MS will apply.  2. MANAGEMENT MEASURES  2.1. Monitoring and reporting rules  The targeted amendments in the Regulation will be monitored and evaluated in accordance with the rules and procedures established in the relevant programmes, namely Horizon Europe, CEF, DEP, EDF, ASAP, and STEP. The frequency and conditions for monitoring and reporting will be as specified in the respective programme regulations and agreements.  Additionally, for provisions related to Cohesion Policy, periodical evaluation and reporting will be conducted in line with the relevant Cohesion Policy obligations, including the requirements for ex-ante evaluations, interim evaluations, and ex-post evaluations, as well as the reporting requirements set out in the applicable regulations and funding agreements.  In general, the monitoring and reporting will be carried out on a regular basis, with the specific frequency and conditions to be determined by the relevant programme authorities and in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations.  2.2. Management and control system(s)  2.2.1. Justification of the budget implementation method(s), the funding implementation mechanism(s), the payment modalities and the control strategy proposed  The proposed budget implementation methods, funding implementation mechanisms, payment modalities, and control strategy are based on the existing structures and mechanisms already in place for the relevant programmes (Horizon Europe, CEF, DEP, EDF, ASAP, STEP).  The amendments introduced by this Regulation do not introduce any alterations in this regard. Instead, they build upon existing frameworks designed to ensure effective, efficient, and economical implementation of the programmes.  The use of direct management, shared management, and executive agencies, as well as the funding implementation mechanisms and control strategies have been established and tested in the context of the existing programmes. The proposed amendments do not require significant changes to these existing structures. The Commission will rely on the existing expertise, systems, and procedures to implement the amended programmes.  The control strategy, including the risk-based approach, ex-ante, interim, and ex-post controls, audits, and evaluations, will continue to be applied in accordance with the existing rules and regulations under relevant programmes. The Commission will continue to monitor and report on the implementation of the programmes, including the amended provisions, in accordance with the existing requirements and procedures.  2.2.2. Information concerning the risks identified and the internal control system(s) set up to mitigate them  The internal control systems in place for the existing programmes (Horizon Europe, CEF, DEP, EDF, ASAP, STEP) have been designed to identify and mitigate risks, including the risk of errors and irregularities.  The amendments introduced by this Regulation do not fundamentally alter the risk landscape of the existing programmes. The Commission will continue to rely on the existing internal control systems, which have been established to ensure the effective and efficient implementation of the programmes.  2.2.3. Estimation and justification of the cost-effectiveness of the controls (ratio between the control costs  and the value of the related funds managed), and assessment of the expected levels of risk of error (at payment & at closure)  The cost-effectiveness of the controls for the amended programmes is expected to be in line with the existing programmes. The Commission will continue to rely on the existing control systems, which have been established to ensure the effective and efficient implementation of the programmes, as the amendments do not introduce significant changes to programmes.  The Commission will continue to monitor and report on the implementation of the programmes, including the amended provisions, in accordance with the existing requirements and procedures.  2.3. Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities  The Commission will continue to apply the measures envisaged under the programmes affected by the proposed Regulation to prevent fraud and irregularities, including measures are outlined in the Commission's anti-fraud strategy.  The amended programmes will also be subject to the Commission's overall anti-fraud framework, which includes regular monitoring and reporting on fraud risks and incidents. The Commission will continue to work closely with the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) and other relevant authorities to prevent and investigate fraud and irregularities.  No additional measures are envisaged at this stage, as the existing measures are considered to be adequate to prevent fraud and irregularities in the amended programmes.  3.

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 164 and 172, Article 173(3) , Article 175, third paragraph, Articles ▌177 and 178, Article 182(1) and (4), Article 183, Article 188, second paragraph, and Article 192(1) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1) ,
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions (2) ,
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (3) ,
Whereas:
(1)  Unprecedented geopolitical instability and the rapid deterioration of regional and global levels of threat and security, in particular Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified war of aggression against Ukraine, which has exposed the Union and its Member States to a high risk of materialisation of conventional military threats, require an urgent and significant increase in the Union’s spending on research , innovation and development, industrial capacity and development of infrastructure connected with resilience, security and defence. The European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB) faces persistent barriers in accessing finance, in particular private finance for investment, due to the risks that market actors associate with such investment. As a consequence, leveraging public defence-related investment is vital. Therefore, as identified in the Joint White Paper of the Commission and of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy of 19 March 2025 for European Defence Readiness 2030 (the ‘Joint White Paper’), which provides a framework for the ReArm Europe Plan, the Union should do more to support the urgent need to increase European defence-related investment with the Union budget , alongside increases in national defence spending by the Member States .
The leveraging of Union funding programmes to support dual-use and defence-related technologies and products serves as a step towards European defence readiness. Such leveraging is also intended to enhance civil-military cooperation across Member States, in light of mutually beneficial spill-over effects. The actions supported by the Union programmes concerned could duly take into account the relevant activities carried out by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and other partners where such activities serve the Union's security and defence interests.
(2) Investment in the development of cutting-edge dual-use and defence capabilities should be promoted, since such investment contributes to the Union’s broader societal resilience, security and competitiveness objectives. The development of dual-use and defence industries throughout the Union, taking into account the risks associated with the increased deterioration of the Union’s security context, is essential to ensuring that all Member States contribute to and benefit from a robust and resilient EDTIB.
(3)  The Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (STEP), established by Regulation (EU) 2024/795 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) , is an initiative aiming to boost Union competitiveness by mobilising funds from 11 existing Union programmes towards critical technologies in three strategic sectors: digital technologies and deep-tech innovation, clean and resource-efficient technologies, and biotechnologies. As such, STEP is a good vehicle to mobilise, in a coordinated and synergetic manner, Union resources towards defence, including key digital frontier technologies required for the development of defence products and technologies.
(4)  While support to technologies having defence implications is possible today under the three existing strategic sectors identified in STEP, it appears necessary to increase the potentialities of development of research, industry and innovation in the defence sector by establishing a fourth strategic sector in STEP, focused on defence technologies without compromising the Union’s intended technological leadership in the existing sectors. This fourth strategic sector should ensure that STEP incentives are used to increase Union funding in innovative defence technologies with the aim of responding effectively to current and emerging threats and of contributing to European competitiveness in line with the STEP objectives. Defence technologies should be understood as those embodied in, or necessary for the development and manufacturing of, defence products, including defence-related products referred to in the Annex to Directive 2009/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (5) . Consistent with the approach applied to the other three sectors set out in Article 2(1) , point (a), of Regulation (EU) 2024/795, the Commission should update the guidance provided for in that Regulation to cover the fourth strategic sector, including on the interpretation of defence technologies ▌. As regards artificial intelligence, AI Gigafactories should become key infrastructure for the purpose of a rapid expansion of the power of AI in defence technologies.
(5)  In addition, in order to optimise the capacity of the programmes covered by STEP to mobilise the Union’s resources towards defence needs , it is necessary to clarify that those programmes are able to pursue objectives and activities that are related to improving the competitiveness and resilience of the EDTIB as well as research and development activities in the defence area.
(6)  Horizon Europe, which was established by Regulation (EU) 2021/695 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6) , is the Union’s ▌funding programme for research and innovation , playing a pivotal role in the global scientific and technological leadership of the Union . The European Innovation Council (EIC) Accelerator established by that Regulation provides support, in particular, for innovations with breakthrough potential, and of a disruptive nature with scale-up potential, which may be too risky for private investors. Small or medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) , start-ups and some small mid-cap enterprises operating within the defence sector require financing for the commercialisation of innovative products.
However, such legal entities face higher barriers for access to finance, compared to legal entities in other sectors . As highlighted in the Joint White Paper, it is necessary to increase European defence readiness, because Europe is currently being affected by war, aggression and other hostile acts. For that purpose, a substantial increase in support to high-impact, defence-related innovation, including much-needed support to SMEs, start-ups and some small mid-caps willing to scale up such high-impact defence-related innovations, is needed. However, the current architecture of Union programmes, including the European Defence Fund (EDF), does not provide the scale, flexibility or speed required to mobilise such support in an effective and timely manner. The current architecture might create uncertainties for the legal entities in the defence sector with regard to the access to support for technologies with potential dual-use applications. Given the severity of the threat in the current environment, extraordinary measures are justified and necessary .
While support for defence research and development is carried out through the EDF, which is a specific programme of Horizon Europe, it is appropriate , on the basis of the current strategic context, to open the EIC Accelerator to actions with potential dual-use applications , while advancing civilian application use . Support to scale-ups under the EIC Accelerator STEP Scale-up Scheme (the ‘Scheme’) should also be extended to non-bankable SMEs, including start-ups and non-bankable small mid-caps, such as entities which have already received support from the Accelerator carrying out breakthrough and disruptive non-bankable innovation in critical defence technologies while fostering, where appropriate, innovations with dual-use potential. Scale-up support in the form of direct equity investment, whereby funding is provided directly to companies, is not available under existing defence-focused funding instruments, in particular the EDF and the Defence Equity Facility deployed under InvestEU.
The opening of the Scheme to innovation in critical defence technologies is therefore necessary to support legal entities investing in the defence sector, while ensuring complementarity with other existing Union instruments . This justifies establishing a targeted exception within the current Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) to the principle set out in Article 7(1) of Regulation (EU) 2021/695, which provides that research and innovation activities under Horizon Europe have an exclusive focus on civil applications, while avoiding unnecessary duplication. The targeted exception is without prejudice to the outcome of the upcoming negotiations in the context of the next MFF. The Commission should ensure proper oversight of the application of the targeted exception, including through the collection and reporting of appropriate data in the context of the existing monitoring and evaluation of the EIC, without creating additional administrative burdens for participants.
(7) As innovation activities with dual-use applications could affect Union strategic assets, interests, autonomy or security or strategic interests of the Union and its Member States, it may be necessary to adapt, in the relevant work programmes under Horizon Europe, the eligibility rules to enable participation to be limited to legal entities established only in Member States or to legal entities established in specified associated countries in addition to Member States, or to exclude the participation of legal entities that are established in the Union or in associated countries and that are directly or indirectly controlled by non-associated third countries or by legal entities of non-associated third countries. Article 48(2) of Regulation (EU) 2021/695 should therefore be amended to allow for such a possibility. The possibility to adapt the eligibility rules in the relevant work programmes is specific to new innovation activities that have dual-use applications and does not affect the rules governing support to activities with civilian applications under Horizon Europe or the funding of such activities.
(8) As innovation activities in critical defence technologies may significantly affect the security and defence interests of the Union and its Member States, it is necessary to establish specific eligibility rules which ensure consistency with other Union instruments in the defence industry sector and which take into account Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine.
Such specific eligibility rules should limit participation to legal entities established in the Union, in Ukraine, or in a member of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) which is a member of the European Economic Area (EEA member) and which is associated to Horizon Europe. Those rules should exclude the participation of legal entities that are directly or indirectly controlled by a third country other than Ukraine or an EEA member associated to Horizon Europe, or by legal entities of such a third country. However, a legal entity established in the Union or in an EEA member associated to Horizon Europe and which is controlled by a third country other than Ukraine or an EEA member associated to Horizon Europe, or by a legal entity of a third-country other than Ukraine or an EEA member associated to Horizon Europe should be eligible to be a beneficiary, provided that guarantees approved in accordance with the national procedures of the Member State or the EEA member in which the legal entity is established are made available to the Commission.
(9) Recognising the urgent and extraordinary need to further strengthen the Union’s sovereignty and security as provided for in Regulation (EU) 2024/795 , and in order to ensure the rapid mobilisation and reinvestment of financial resources in critical sectors, including dual-use and defence projects under the EIC Accelerator under Horizon Europe , it is appropriate to derogate from Article 212(3) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7) (the ‘Financial Regulation’) . Given those circumstances and the need for a rapid availability of funds, it is particularly necessary to allow for repayments, including reimbursed advances, revenues and unused amounts net of the fees and costs of the EIC blended finance investment component of the EIC Pilot under Horizon 2020 to be reinvested in the EIC Fund rather than directed to the Union budget , in order to finance projects with civil applications, as well as projects in dual-use and defence that benefit from the amended scope ▌. The timeframe set out in Article 212(3) of the Financial Regulation should be amended to ensure meaningful implementation under exceptional circumstances To allow for that possibility, it is necessary to introduce a derogation from that provision .
(10)  The EDF, established by Regulation (EU) 2021/697 of the European Parliament and of the Council (8) , is the leading programme for enhancing the competitiveness, innovation, efficiency and technological autonomy of the Union’s defence industry. The EDF aims to support actions that are conducive to developing disruptive technologies for defence. In order to better address the specificities of such actions, such as if they have a particularly small scale or particular need for quick support, it is appropriate to significantly shorten and simplify the procedures to decide on the support for those actions, while at the same time framing the conditions for the decision on such support in the work programme and without undermining the principle of excellence .
(11)  It is also necessary to exploit synergies between the EDF and other Union programmes. To that end, it should be possible for Member States, Union institutions, bodies and agencies, third countries, international financial institutions or other third parties to provide voluntary contributions to the EDF, as external assigned revenues. Voluntary transfers of resources allocated to Member States in shared management to the EDF and the combination of contributions from the EDF with other Union programmes for specific actions should be possible, provided that cumulative Union support does not exceed the total eligible costs of the action.
(12) On 23 June 2022, the European Council decided to grant the status of candidate country to Ukraine, which expressed a strong will to link reconstruction with reforms on its European path. On 15 December 2023, the European Council decided to open accession negotiations with Ukraine and declared that the Union and its Member States remain committed to contributing, for the long-term and together with partners, to security commitments to Ukraine which will help the latter to defend itself, resist destabilisation efforts and deter acts of aggression in the future. Strong support to Ukraine is a key priority for the Union and an appropriate response to the Union’s strong political commitment to support Ukraine for as long as necessary.
On 5 March 2023, the Commission proposed to create an Instrument (the ‘Ukraine Support Instrument’) to address the damage caused by Russia’s war of aggression to the Ukrainian Defence Technological and Industrial Base (the ‘Ukrainian DTIB’) and to support its reconstruction, recovery and modernisation, taking into account its possible future integration into the EDTIB. The Ukrainian DTIB has significantly developed its research, development and innovation capacities since the beginning of the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine in order to address the needs of the Ukrainian armed forces. In that context, ensuring a closer cooperation between the EDTIB and the Ukrainian DTIB would allow access by the EDTIB to those capabilities and would contribute to the objective of fostering the competitiveness and innovation of the EDTIB, while being consistent with the continuous support of the Union to the strengthening of the defence manufacturing capacities of Ukraine. Accordingly, in light of the common objectives and goals of the Union and Ukraine in the area of defence research and development and in light of the benefits for both sides which can be expected from a closer integration in that regard, it is appropriate to associate Ukraine to the EDF.
(13)  The Digital Europe Programme (DEP), established by Regulation (EU) 2021/694 of the European Parliament and of the Council (9) , aims to support and accelerate the digital transformation of the European economy, industry and society and to improve the competitiveness of Europe in the global digital economy. In that context, the programme should aim to support, in particular, projects, services and competences with potential dual-use application under all its specific objectives. This would contribute to strengthening the Union's societal resilience in the face of ongoing hybrid attacks and foreign interference. Recognising the strategic importance of cross-border cooperation and the facilitation of technology transfers between Member States in dual-use projects in the digital sector, the Commission should take into account the trans-European dimension when awarding dual-use projects. It is therefore appropriate to make this award criterion mandatory for dual-use projects.
(14)  To enhance technological sovereignty and competitiveness, the Union needs the computing, cloud and data infrastructure required by AI leadership. As part of the AI Continent strategy, the AI factories and AI Gigafactories are essential to enable the Union to compete at the global level and ensure its strategic autonomy and competitiveness in science, ▌in research with dual-use potential and in critical industrial sectors, including the defence industry. Next-generation AI models require extensive connected computing infrastructure for breakthroughs in specific domains including defence. It is therefore appropriate to add, in Specific Objective 1 – High Performance Computing of DEP, a supplementary operational objective dedicated to the deployment and operation of AI Factories and new generation of AI Gigafactories specialised in developing, training, and running the most complex, very large, AI models and applications, including hardware and software necessary for such deployment.
(15) The intensifying exposure to cyber and hybrid threats in the Union justifies adding an explicit focus on resilience against cyber and hybrid threats under Specific Objective 3 of DEP. In Specific Objective 5 of DEP, Deployment and Best Use of Digital Capacity and Interoperability, it is also necessary to add, in the operational objective defined to support the public sector and areas of public interest, a reference to defence in order to clarify that the financial contribution of the Union under such an objective can be extended to that sector.
(16)  It may also be necessary to adapt the eligibility rules in the work programme of DEP for specific and duly justified cases, so that legal entities established in associated countries or established in the Union but controlled from third countries, are not eligible to participate in all or some actions focused on technologies with dual-use potential under any specific objective. Provision should therefore be made to allow for such a possibility. In such cases, calls for proposals and calls for tenders should be restricted to legal entities established or deemed to be established in the Union and controlled by Member States or by nationals of Member States.
▌
(17)  The Connecting Europe Facility (CEF), established by Regulation (EU) 2021/1153 of the European Parliament and of the Council ▌ (10) , aims to accelerate investment in the field of trans-European networks, enabling synergies between the transport, energy and digital sectors. In order to support the connected computing infrastructure required by defence products and technologies and beyond those areas, the objectives of the CEF digital sector within that Regulation should be extended to the deployment and provision of digital capacities such as cloud, AI , AI factories and AI Gigafactories.
(18)  ▌The Joint White Paper recognised military mobility as an essential enabler for European security and defence and stressed the Union added-value in supporting dual-use infrastructure for mobility. In the context of the Joint White Paper, the Commission and the High Representative recognised the importance of identifying military mobility hot spot projects and of removing key gaps and bottlenecks along the four EU Priority Military Mobility Corridors. Military mobility is also one of the objectives of the CEF. The Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) policy serves as a key strategic instrument in building the Union’s cross-border transport infrastructure. Although originally intended for civilian purposes, it also holds a remarkable potential for civilian-defence dual use. Moreover, the Niinistö report of 30 October 2024 on Strengthening Europe’s Civilian and Military Preparedness and Readiness specifically refers to the need to intensify further work on priority dual-use transport corridors for military movements and the extension of fuel-supply chains for the armed forces along those corridors. Given the importance of strengthening the dual-use transport infrastructure ▌in light of the deteriorating security context of the Union, it is appropriate to clarify that specific activities within actions under Specific Objective 3(2) of the CEF may, where relevant, include measures to safeguard the dual-use transport infrastructure with regard to military counter-mobility or to provide fuel infrastructure for civilian-defence dual use .
(19) The mid-term review of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the Cohesion Fund, both established by Regulation (EU) 2021/1058 of the European Parliament and of the Council (11) , introduced the possibility to invest in defence or dual-use infrastructure to foster military mobility benefiting from a pre-financing of 20 % of the amounts programmed and the possibility to apply a Union financing increased by 10 percentage points above the co-financing rate applicable, not exceeding 100 %. Where Member States transfer resources allocated to them in shared management to the CEF, they should benefit from the same conditions on pre-financing and co-financing rates for dual-use transport infrastructure projects as introduced in the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund. In such a case, those amounts should be reserved to projects developing the EU Priority Military Mobility Corridors identified by the Member States in Annex II to the Military Requirements for Military Mobility within and beyond the EU, as approved by the Council on 17 March 2025, or any later version of that annex approved by the Council, as well as digital connectivity and capacities, including logistics hubs and cross-border sections of those corridors. The Financial Regulation provides for a possibility to introduce conditions for participation in specific award procedures which affect security and public order.
Accordingly, it should be possible to provide for such specific conditions in relation to actions located on one or more of the EU Priority Military Mobility Corridors, including conditions relating to the country of origin of the equipment, goods, supplies or service.
(20)  Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely to strengthen research and development activities in dual-use and defence, improve the competitiveness of the Union’s defence industry and therefore contribute to the Union’s defence readiness by refocusing investment of these critical priorities, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but can rather be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives.
(21)  Given the urgent need to enable crucial investment in defence in the context of pressing geopolitical challenges, this Regulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union .
(22)  Regulations (EU) 2021/694, (EU) 2021/695, (EU) 2021/697, (EU) 2021/1153 ▌ and (EU) 2024/795 should therefore be amended accordingly,

This initiative seeks to bolster the EU's defense capabilities by amending existing regulations to support increased investment in military resources and a coordinated response to emerging threats. A key component of the proposal is the expansion of the Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (STEP) to include critical defense technologies such as air and missile defense, drones, cyber capabilities, and artificial intelligence.

To achieve these objectives, the proposal suggests modifications to several EU programs, including the European Defence Fund (EDF), the Digital Europe Programme (DEP), and Horizon Europe. These changes are designed to pool funding, allow resource transfers from cohesion policy funds to the EDF, and support dual-use technologies that serve both civilian and military purposes. Additionally, the proposal aims to extend the Supporting Ammunition Production (ASAP) regulation and utilize unused funds from Horizon 2020 for new projects, with the goal of strengthening the EU's defense industry by ensuring long-term investment in new production capacities and enhancing the Union's technological and industrial base in defense.

The proposal also emphasizes the importance of skills development in critical defense technologies through the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+) and advocates for a coordinated EU-level approach to ensure seamless mobility for military personnel and equipment. It suggests adapting the timeframe in the Financial Regulation to allow for more flexibility in decision-making. To further support these goals, the proposal includes amendments to various EU financial",

The threat of ounterfeiting is still substantial. Even though the average number of annually detected counterfeit euro banknotes remains under control, continued vigilance is needed, as demonstrated by the increasing availability of high quality counterfeit euro's and security features on the internet/darknet, the emergence of altered design banknotes, and the existence of counterfeiting hotspots, e.g. in Türkiye and China. Furthermore, euro cash continues to be used widely in the EU alongside electronic means of payment, therefore necessitating ongoing protection against counterfeiting of the single currency. Counterfeits harm citizens and businesses that are not reimbursed for counterfeits even if received in good faith. More generally, it impacts the legal tender status of and trust of citizens and businesses in genuine euro notes and coins.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions  Since the introduction of the euro as a single currency, there is the need to protect the euro against counterfeiting at EU level and to have a specific programme dedicated for this purpose. The current ''Pericles IV'' programme is specifically dedicated to the protection of euro banknotes and coins against counterfeiting, and was established by Regulation (EU)  2021/840 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2021 1 .  Pericles IV’s distinct transnational and multi-disciplinary 2 approach and focus on capacity-building to protect the euro makes it unique among EU-level programmes. As assessed continuously in the programme’s annual reports, it is clearly complementar y to the Technical Assistance and Information Exchange (TAIEX) instrument, that is most often used in support of accession negotiations, and the Internal Security Fund - Police 3 , which covers the prevention and combating of crime in general. Following the inclusion of counterfeiting of currencies as one of the priorities in the Operational Action Plan of EMPACT 4 , the Commission is closely coordinating with the EMPACT driver in order to maximise the complementarity between the two sources of financing. G iven its specialisation and interdisciplinarity, the Pericles programme take s the initiative with regard to training and capacity building, while EMPACT focus es its activities on law enforcement operational support actions .  This legislative proposal concerns the initiative to continue the Pericles programme beyond 2027.  • Consistency with other Union policies  The prevention and combatting of counterfeiting and counterfeiting-related fraud helps to preserve the integrity of the euro, thus strengthening the trust of citizens and business in the genuineness of the euro and therefore contributing to ensuring the effective functioning of the euro, safeguarding fiscal and financial stability in the EU and fostering the international use of the Union’s single currency for trade, financial services and investment.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  Union's legislation concerning the protection of the euro against counterfeiting falls within the scope of Article 133 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). This provision provides that the European Parliament and the Council, acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure shall, after consultation of the European Central Bank, lay down the measures necessary for the use of the euro as the single currency. As with the previous editions of the programme, the application of the Pericles V programme will be extended to the Member States whose currency is not the euro, through a proposal for a parallel Council Regulation based on Article 352 TFEU.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  In accordance with Article 5(3) TEU, the principle of subsidiarity does not apply in areas which fall within the Union’s exclusive competence. In accordance with Article 3(1)(c) TFEU, the EU has an exclusive competence to lay down the measures necessary for the use of the euro as the single currency for the Member States whose currency is the euro. In this area, action by the euro area Member States is not possible and the principle of subsidiarity thus does not apply.  • Proportionality  The proposed Regulation is necessary, suitable and appropriate for achieving the desired end. It proposes to efficiently strengthen cooperation among the Member States and between the Commission and the Member States, without restricting Member States’ capability to protect the euro against counterfeiting. Action at Union level is justified as it clearly assists Member States in collectively protecting the euro and encourages the use of common Union structures to increase cooperation and information exchange between competent authorities.  • Choice of the instrument  The proposed instrument is a Regulation, in continuity with Regulation (EU) 2021/840 establishing the Pericles IV programme. The Regulation has proven to provide the legal certainty required for an effective protection of the euro against counterfeiting which could not have been achieved by means of other legal instruments.  The application of the Pericles programme will be extended to the Member States whose currency is not the euro, through a proposal for a parallel Council Regulation in continuity with Council Regulation (EU) 2021/1696.  3. RESULTS OF RETROSPECTIVE EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Retrospective evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  An interim evaluation of the Pericles IV programme was conducted in 2024, in accordance with Article 13 of Regulation (EU) 2021/840. The evaluation concludes that the Pericles IV Programme is delivering on its objective of contributing to the prevention and combating of euro counterfeiting, thereby preserving the integrity of euro banknotes and coins.  The Programme has generally proven effective in improving information exchange, technical skills, institutional frameworks and operational capabilities in combating euro counterfeiting, in both EU Member States and in third countries. It has successfully facilitated networking and collaborative investigations, leading to significant achievements such as investigations resulting in euro counterfeit seizures and dismantled criminal organisations.  By providing technical trainings, seminars, staff exchanges, and studies, the Programme has supported measures undertaken by Member States, especially where national funding is limited. The Pericles IV Programme has therefore ensured an efficient use of resources thus far in achieving the Programme’s outputs, results, and impacts. While management costs are comparatively high in relative terms compared to similar programmes, this is mainly due to the limited overall budget of the Programme. Their overall share is also declining due to digitalisation, indicating overall efficiency gains. The close involvement of the Commission services in the coordination and implementation of actions, for example by chairing the Euro Counterfeiting Expert Group’s (ECEG) meetings, ensures Member State buy-in and effective monitoring. The Pericles IV generation of the Programme undergoes interim and ex-post evaluations, although given its small size and the high degree of continuity over multiple programming periods, the question of the proportionality of two evaluation requirements per funding cycle relative to the overall budget led to the suggestion for the next generation of the programme to replace one of the two evaluations with an implementation report.  Additionally, the Programme is found to be complementary and coherent relative to initiatives undertaken by other Union institutions, such as the ECB and Europol. As Member State initiatives are limited in scope, the Programme fills this gap by offering multinational and multidisciplinary actions that provide expertise and foster relationship-building among Member States and with third countries. Indeed, the Programme offers significant EU added value by establishing and enhancing relationships and cooperation among Member States, third countries, Union institutions, and international organisations that are beyond the reach of individual national authorities.  The Pericles IV programme also continues to be highly relevant and has adapted to evolving threats. Continuous attention is needed to counter emerging counterfeiting threats and to ensure that the number of euro counterfeits detected remains under control and at low levels: as long as cash is used, the risk posed by counterfeits persists. Current threats which the future programme will need to address include the distribution of counterfeits and high quality components on the internet/darknet, as well as countering ‘movie money’ and ‘prop copy’ products. It also includes potential threats relating to the future digital euro and the impact of Artificial Intelligence on counterfeit currency production and identification. Finally, the evaluation pointed out that the Programme works to ensure the sustainability over time of its outputs and future progress towards its objectives by the transfer of knowledge through regular follow-up actions and ongoing support from the Programme. Stakeholders point to evolving threats and a degree of staff turnover within competent national authorities, and emphasise the need for repeated training every 2-3 years, which attests to the importance of continuing the programme with a similar scope.  • Stakeholder consultations  The proposals for EU programmes under the next multiannual financial framework were preceded by seven public consultations 5 , most notably on EU funding for the single market, and cooperation between national authorities; EU funding for competitiveness; or implementing EU funding with Member States and regions. The consultations targeted a wide range of stakeholders, including citizens, businesses, SMEs, public authorities, recipients of EU funding, civil society organisations, academia, and international stakeholders.  These consultations corroborate the need for streamlined investments in EU competitiveness and the single market at EU level, including through cooperation between national administrations. They show a pronounced agreement among key stakeholders that the single market is strengthened through the optimisation of technical and administrative capacities for Member States; that national authorities, citizens, consumers, and businesses are empowered by resolving knowledge and data gaps; or that addressing transnational challenges and facilitating cross-border cooperation are areas with a clear EU added value.  • Impact assessment  In line with the requirements set out by the EU Financial Regulation 6 and the better regulation guidelines 7 , programmes which provide continuity as regards content and structure or have a relatively small budget, do not require an impact assessment but rather an ex-ante evaluation in the form of a Staff Working Document. The ex-ante evaluation SWD (SWD(…) accompanying this proposal fulfils the Better Regulation requirements. It assesses that the continuation of the Pericles programme would ensure its continued effectiveness in protecting the euro against counterfeiting and counterfeiting-related fraud , notably by ensuring targeted Commission direct actions complementing Member States' actions, and would sustain the long-term effects of the programme as confirmed by its interim evaluation. The high-level of EU added value of the programme is derived from its unique focus, reflected in its legal basis in Article 133 of TFEU, which along with its transnationality and multi-disciplinarity makes it stand out in relation to other EU programmes and national modes of action. Furthermore, with the Commission in charge of both the direct management of the programme and the designing and implementation of EU policy and legislation for the protection of the euro, it guarantees the effective achievement of the objectives of the programme, since it links legislation and policy with the implementation of the programme.  The continuation of the current programme with an increased envelope would ensure its continued effectiveness, also by ensuring targeted Commission direct actions complementing Member States' actions, and would sustain the long-term effects of the programme as confirmed by its interim evaluation. The increased budget would likely result in an increased number of implemented actions and number of action participants compared to the Pericles IV programme period. It would thus assure the fulfilment of the objectives of the Programme by protecting the euro against counterfeiting and counterfeiting related fraud, ensuring an up-to-date framework to detect euro counterfeiting, adapting for upcoming and evolving threats, establishing and sustaining an effective and well-trained anti-counterfeiting network of experts.  • Simplification  The financial implementation of Pericles will be further simplified by an increased use of simplified cost options for grants which would reduce the administrative burden for the applicants to the programme.  • Fundamental rights  The proposal is in line and respects the Union values enshrined in Article 2 of the Treaty on the European Union and the fundamental rights enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the Charter), where the objectives of the proposed initiative are linked to the promotion of fundamental rights and the application of the Charter. For instance, the proposal promotes the freedom to conduct a business by guaranteeing the safe use of the Union’s single currency as a payment method.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  The European Commission proposes to allocate an indicative financial envelope of EUR 7 000 000 (in current prices) t o the programme for 2028-20 34 8 . The detailed estimated financial impact of this proposal is presented in the legislative financial and digital statement enclosed with this proposal .  2025/0258 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  establishing the exchange, assistance and training programme for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting for the period 2028-2034 (the 'Pericles V' programme) and repealing Regulation (EU) 2021/840  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 133 thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank 9 ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure  Whereas:  (1) The Union and the Member States have set themselves the objective of laying down the measures necessary for the use of the euro as a single currency. Those measures include protecting the euro against counterfeiting and counterfeiting-related fraud, thus strengthening the trust of citizens and business in the genuineness of the euro and therefore contributing to ensuring the effective functioning of the eur o, safeguarding fiscal and financial stability in the Union and foste ring the international use of the euro for trade , financial services and investment .  (2) Council Regulation (EC) No 1338/2001 10 provides for exchanges of information, cooperation and mutual assistance, thereby establishing a harmonised framework for the protection of the euro. The effects of that Regulation were extended by Council Regulation (EC) No 1339/2001 11 to those Member States which have not adopted the euro as their single currency, so as to provide an equivalent level of protection for the euro throughout the Union.  (3) Past support for such actions, through Council Decisions 2001/923/EC 12 and 2001/924/EC 13 , which established the first Pericles programme and were subsequently amended and extended by Council Decisions 2006/75/EC, 2006/76/EC, 2006/849/EC, 2006/850/EC, and Regulations (EU) No 331/2014 14 and (EU) 2021/840 of the European Parliament and of the Council 15 , have enhanced the actions of the Union and the Member States in the field of the protection of the euro against counterfeiting. Through these different acts, the Pericles programme has successfully contributed to ensuring  the protection of the euro against counterfeiting.  (4) In that respect, i n its Communication on the results of the interim evaluation of the Pericles IV programme 16 , the Commission conclude d that the current implementing structure of Pericles IV programme is generally effective, efficient, and sustainable and remains relevant in adapting to evolving threats. The Pericles IV p rogramme addresses a critical gap in many Member States, where resources for organising international and multidisciplinary training on euro counterfeiting are often limited. By providing targeted support, the programme strengthens the Union ’s capacity to combat euro counterfeiting and supports the development of new relationships, networks and transnational cooperation efforts. Therefore, the Pericles programme should be continued beyond 2028.  (5) The protection of the European single currency as a public good has a clear transnational dimension, and therefore euro protection goes beyond the interest and the responsibility of individual Member States. Considering the cross-border circulation of the euro and the deep involvement of international organised crime in euro counterfeiting, national protection frameworks should be complemented by Union initiative to ensure homogeneous national and international cooperation, and to face possible emerging transnational risks. Therefore by establishing the exchange, assistance and training programme for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting, this Regulation is necessary, suitable and appropriate for achieving the objectives of the Programme. The Programme should efficiently strengthen cooperation among the Member States and between the Commission and the Member States, without restricting Member States’ capability to protect the euro against counterfeiting. Action at Union level is justified as it clearly assists Member States in collectively protecting the euro and encourages the use of common Union structures to increase cooperation and information exchange between competent authorities.  (6) This Regulation lays down a n indicative financial envelope for the exchange, assistance and training programme for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting (the ‘Pericles V’ programme). For the purpose of this Regulation, current prices are calculated by applying a fixed 2% deflator.  (7) In a rapidly changing economic, social and geopolitical environment, recent experience has shown the need for a more flexible multiannual financial framework and Union spending programmes. To that effect, and in line with the objectives of this Regulation, the funding should duly consider the evolving policy needs and Union’s priorities as identified in relevant documents published by the Commission, in Council conclusions and European Parliament resolutions while ensuring sufficient predictability for the budget implementation.  (8) Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 of the European Parliament and of the Council 17 applies to th e ‘Pericles V’ programme . It lays down the rules on the establishment and the implementation of the general budget of the Union , including the rules on grants, prizes, non-financial donations, procurement, indirect management , financial assistance, financial instruments and budgetary guarantees.  (9) In accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 , Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council 18 , Council Regulation ( EC, Euratom) No 2988/95 19 , Council Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 20 and Council Regulation (EU) 2017/1939 21 , the financial interests of the Union are to be protected through proportionate measures, including the prevention, detection, correction and investigation of irregularities and fraud, the recovery of funds lost, wrongly paid or incorrectly used and, where appropriate, the imposition of administrative sanctions. In particular, in accordance with Regulation s (Euratom) No 883/2013 and (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) may carry out investigations, including on-the-spot checks and inspections, with a view to establishing whether there has been fraud, corruption or any other illegal activity affecting the financial interests of the Union. In accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017/1939, the European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO) may investigate and prosecute fraud , corruption and other criminal offences affecting the financial interests of the Union as provided for in Directive (EU) 2017/1371 of the European Parliament and of the Council 22 . In accordance with  Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509, any person or entity receiving Union funds is to fully cooperate in the protection of the Union’s financial interests, to grant the necessary rights and access to the Commission, OLAF, the EPPO and the European Court of Auditors and to ensure that any third parties involved in the implementation of Union funds grant equivalent rights.  (10) The Programme is to be implemented in accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) 202X/XXXX which establishes the rules for the expenditure tracking and the performance framework for the budget, including rules for ensuring a uniform application of the principles of ‘do no significant harm’ and gender equality referred to in Article 33(2), points (d) and (f), of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 respectively, rules for monitoring and reporting on the performance of Union programmes and activities, rules for establishing a Union funding portal, rules for the evaluation of the programmes, as well as other horizontal provisions applicable to all Union programmes such as those on information, communication and visibility.  (11) Pursuant to Article 85(1) of Council Decision (EU) 2021/1764 23 , persons and entities established in overseas countries and territories are eligible for funding under the Programme and subject to possible arrangements applicable to the Member State to which the relevant overseas country or territory is linked .  (12) Actions eligible for funding, with the aim of promoting exchanges of information and staff, technical and scientific assistance and specialised training, help significantly to protect the Union’s single currency against counterfeiting and counterfeiting-related fraud and therefore to attain a high and equivalent level of protection across the Union, whilst demonstrating the Union’s ability to tackle serious organised crime. In order for the P rogramme to be future-proof, there is a need to maintain the balance between the different types of actions eligible for funding, and the need to maintain its focus on current and emerging threats, including altered-design banknotes and the distribution of counterfeits through the internet. Eligible actions should also cover potential future developments, such as potential threats to the future digital euro, and potential threats posed by and investigational opportunities offered by a rtificial i ntelligence. The purchase of equipment to be used by specialised anti-counterfeiting authorities of third countries for protecting the euro against counterfeiting is also vital to provide for an adequate protection of the euro in third countries, but the purchase of equipment should also be accompanied by the training necessary for its use. Therefore, for this type of action, the purchase of equipment should not be the sole component of the action.  (13) To take into account the transnational and multidisciplinary aspects of the fight against counterfeiting, a balance between the different target groups and participants in the P rogramme’s actions is necessary. Therefore, all actions should be transnational and multidisciplinary in nature, and alongside traditional stakeholders such as law enforcement and national central banks, it is also beneficial to get the judiciary, customs and parcel and delivery services more involved in programme actions as participants ,  (14) The Programme replaces the programme established by Regulation (EU) 2021/840 for 2021 to 2027 . Regulation (EU) 2021/840 should therefore be repealed.  (15) To ensure a smooth transition without interruption between the Pericles IV programme and the Pericles V programme it is appropriate to align the duration of the Pericles V programme with the period of application[reference to the post 2027 MFF Regulation] Regulation (EU, Euratom) …/ 20 xx [?] ]. Therefore, the Pericles V programme should apply from 1 January 2028,  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Article [1]  Subject matter  This Regulation establishes the exchange, assistance and training programme for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting (the ‘Pericles V’ programme) (the ‘Programme’) and lays down the objectives of the Programme, its budget for the period 2028-2034, the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding.  Article [2]  Programme objectives  1. The general objective of the Programme is to prevent and combat counterfeiting and counterfeiting-related fraud and preserve the integrity of the euro, thus strengthening the trust of citizens and business in the genuineness of the euro and therefore contributing to ensuring the effective functioning of the euro, safeguarding fiscal and financial stability in the Union and fostering the international use of the euro for trade, financial services and investment.  2. The Programme has the specific objective to protect the euro against counterfeiting and counterfeiting-related fraud, taking also into account potential future developments, such as potential threats to the future digital euro, and potential threats posed by and investigational opportunities offered by artificial intelligence. It does so by supporting and supplementing the measures undertaken by Member States and assisting the competent national and Union authorities in their efforts to develop among themselves and with the Commission a close and regular cooperation and an exchange of best practice, where appropriate including third countries and international organisations.  Article [3]  Budget  1. The indicative financial envelope for the implementation of the Programme for the period 2028- 2034 is set at EUR 7 000 000 in current prices.  2. Appropriations may be entered in the Union budget beyond 2034 to cover the expenses necessary and to enable the management of actions not completed by the end of the Programme.  3. The financial envelope referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article and the amounts of additional resources referred to in Article 4 may also be used for technical and administrative assistance for the implementation of the Programme, such as preparatory, monitoring, control, audit and evaluation activities, corporate information technology systems and platforms, information, visibility and communication activities, including corporate communication on the political priorities of the Union, and all other technical and administrative assistance or staff-related expenses incurred by the Commission for the management of the Programme.  Article [4]  Additional resources  1. Member States, Union institutions, bodies and agencies, third countries, international organisations, international financial institutions, or other third parties, may make additional financial or non-financial contributions to the Programme. Additional financial contributions shall constitute external assigned revenue within the meaning of Article 21(2), points (a), (d), or (e), or Article 21(5) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509.  2. Resources allocated to Member States under shared management may, at their request, be made available to the Programme. The Commission shall implement those resources directly or indirectly in accordance with Article 62(1), point (a) or (c), of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509. They shall be additional to the amount referred to in Article 3(1) of this Regulation. Those resources shall be used for the benefit of the Member State concerned. Where the Commission has not entered into a legal commitment under direct or indirect management for additional amounts thus made available to the Programme, the corresponding uncommitted amounts may, at the request of the Member State concerned, be transferred back to one or more respective source programmes or their successors.  Article [5]  Alternative, combined and cumulative funding  1. The Programme shall be implemented in synergy with other Union programmes. An action that has received a Union contribution from another programme may also receive a contribution under the Programme. The rules of the relevant Union programme shall apply to the corresponding contribution or a single set of rules may be applied to all contributions and a single legal commitment may be concluded. If the Union contribution is based on eligible costs, the cumulative support from the Union budget shall not exceed the total eligible costs of the action and may be calculated on a pro-rata basis in accordance with the documents setting out the conditions for support.  2. Award procedures under the Programme may be jointly conducted under direct or indirect management with Member States, Union institutions, bodies and agencies, third countries, international organisations, international financial institutions, or other third parties (‘partners to the joint award procedure’), provided the protection of the financial interests of the Union is ensured. Such procedures shall be subject to a single set of rules and lead to the conclusion of single legal commitments. For that purpose, the partners to the joint award procedure may make resources available to the Programme in accordance with Article [5] of this Regulation, or the partners may be entrusted with the implementation of the award procedure, where applicable in accordance with Article 62(1), point (c), of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024 /2509. In joint award procedures , representatives of the partners to the joint award procedure may also be members of the evaluation committee referred to in Article 153(3) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024 /2509.

FRAMEWORK OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE  1.1. Title of the proposal/initiative  Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the Pericles V programme for the period 2028-2034.  1.2. Policy area(s) concerned  Protection of the euro against counterfeiting.  1.3. Objective(s)  1.3.1. General objective(s)  The general objective of the Programme is to prevent and combat counterfeiting and counterfeiting-related fraud and preserve the integrity of the euro, thus strengthening the trust of citizens and business in the genuineness of the euro and therefore contributing to ensuring the effective functioning of the euro, safeguarding fiscal and financial stability in the Union and fostering the international use of the euro for trade, financial services and investment.  1.3.2. Specific objective(s)  The Programme has the following specific objective: to protect the euro against counterfeiting and counterfeiting-related fraud, taking also into account potential future developments, such as potential threats to the future digital euro, and potential threats posed by and investigational opportunities offered by Artificial Intelligence. It does so by supporting and supplementing the measures undertaken by Member States and assisting the competent national and Union authorities in their efforts to develop among themselves and with the Commission a close and regular cooperation and an exchange of best practice, where appropriate including third countries and international organisations.  1.3.3. Expected result(s) and impact  The Pericles programme will help the beneficiaries – the competent authorities of Member States – in their work protecting the euro against counterfeiting and counterfeiting-related fraud through training, exchange of best practice and awareness raising. Target groups for the action of the programme will be all staff in public and private sector related to the protection of the euro.  1.3.4. Indicators of performance  This initiative will be monitored through the performance framework for the post-2027 budget, which is examined in a separate proposal. The performance framework provides for an implementation report during the implementation phase of the programme, as well as a retrospective evaluation to be carried out in accordance with Article 34(3) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509. The evaluation shall be conducted in accordance with the Commission's Better Regulation Guidelines and will be based on indicators relevant to the objectives of the programme  The output and result indicators for the purpose of monitoring progress and achievements of this programme will correspond to the common indicators provided under Regulation xxx [Horizontal Performance Regulation]  1.4. The proposal/initiative relates to:   a new action   a new action following a pilot project / preparatory action 24   the extension of an existing action   a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action  1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative  1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative  The euro is, as the single currency of the Union, a core European interest, the integrity of which needs to be protected in all its dimensions. The threat of counterfeiting is  still substantial. Even though the average number of annually detected counterfeit euro banknotes remains under control, continued vigilance is needed, as demonstrated by the increasing availability of high quality counterfeit euro's and security features on the internet/darknet, the emergence of altered design banknotes, and the existence of counterfeiting hotspots within and outside the EU.. Furthermore, euro cash continues to be used widely in the EU alongside electronic means of payment, therefore necessitating ongoing protection against counterfeiting of the single currency. Counterfeits harm citizens and businesses that are not reimbursed for counterfeits even if received in good faith. More generally, it impacts the legal tender status of and trust of citizens and businesses in genuine euro notes and coins.  As the protection of the euro against counterfeiting requires continous attention, the implementation of the initiative will be rolled out on a continuous basis, through dedicated grants and procured actions.  1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, great er effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this section 'added value of EU involvement' is the value resulting from EU action, that is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.  The protection of the European single currency as a public good has a clear transnational dimension, and therefore euro protection goes beyond the interest and the responsibility of individual EU Member States. Considering the cross-border circulation of the euro and the deep involvement of international organised crime in euro counterfeiting (production and distribution), national protection frameworks need to be complemented by an EU initiative to ensure homogeneous national and international cooperation, and to face possible emerging transnational risks.  . By providing targeted support, the Programme strengthens the EU’s capacity to combat euro counterfeiting. An absence of the Programme would impact ongoing initiatives and hinder the development of new relationships and networks, impeding transnational cooperation efforts.  Expected generated EU added value  The Programme offers significant EU added value by establishing and enhancing relationships and cooperation among Member States, third countries, Union institutions, and international organisations that are beyond the reach of individual national authorities, such as establishing a coordinated relationship with the Chinese authorities to counter threats such as the distribution of counterfeit euro holograms, and encouraging a common EU strategy to counter the threats posed by altered design banknotes.  By providing targeted support, the Programme strengthens the EU’s capacity to combat euro counterfeiting. An absence of the Programme would impact ongoing initiatives and hinder the development of new relationships and networks, impeding transnational cooperation efforts.  1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past  A mid-term evaluation of the Pericles IV programme was conducted in 2024, in accordance with Article 13 of Regulation (EU) No 2021/840. The evaluation concludes that the Pericles IV Programme is delivering on its objective of contributing to the prevention and combating of euro counterfeiting, thereby preserving the integrity of euro banknotes and coins.  The Programme has generally proven effective in improving information exchange, technical skills, institutional frameworks and operational capabilities in combating euro counterfeiting, in both EU Member States and in third countries. It has successfully facilitated networking and collaborative investigations, leading to significant achievements such as investigations resulting in euro counterfeit seizures and dismantled criminal organisations.  According to the mid-term evaluation of the Pericles IV programme, the programme addresses a critical gap in many Member States, where resources for organising international and multidisciplinary trainings on euro counterfeiting are often limited. By providing technical trainings, seminars, staff exchanges, and studies, the Programme has supported measures undertaken by Member States, especially where national funding is limited. The Pericles IV Programme has therefore ensured an efficient use of resources thus far in achieving the Programme’s outputs, results, and impacts. While management costs are comparatively high in relative terms compared to similar programmes, this is mainly due to the limited overall budget of the Programme. Their overall share is also declining due to digitalisation, indicating overall efficiency gains. The close involvement of the Commission services in the coordination and implementation of actions, for example by chairing the Euro Counterfeiting Expert Group’s (ECEG) meetings, ensures Member State buy-in and effective monitoring. The Pericles IV generation of the Programme undergoes mid-term and ex-post evaluations, although given its small size and the high degree of continuity over multiple programming periods, the question of the proportionality of two evaluation requirements per funding cycle relative to the overall budget led to the suggestion for the next generation of the programme to replace one of the two evaluations with an implementation report.  Additionally, the Programme is found to be complementary and coherent relative to initiatives undertaken by other Union institutions, such as the ECB and Europol. As Member State initiatives are limited in scope, the Programme fills this gap by offering multinational and multidisciplinary actions that provide expertise and foster relationship-building among Member States and with third countries.  The Pericles IV programme also continues to be highly relevant and has adapted to evolving threats. . Continuous attention is needed to counter emerging counterfeiting threats and to ensure that the number of euro counterfeits detected remains under control and at low levels: as long as cash is used, the risk posed by counterfeits persists. Current threats which the future programme will need to address include the distribution of counterfeits and high quality components on the internet/darknet, as well as countering ‘movie money’ and ‘prop copy’ products. It also includes potential threats relating to the future digital euro and the impact of Artificial Intelligence on counterfeit currency production and identification. Finally, the evaluation pointed out that the Programme works to ensure the sustainability over time of its outputs and future progress towards its objectives by the transfer of knowledge through regular follow-up actions and ongoing support from the Programme. Stakeholders point to evolving threats and a degree of staff turnover within competent national authorities, and emphasise the need for repeated training every 2-3 years, which attests to the importance of continuing the programme with a similar scope.  1.5.4. Compatibility with the multiannual financial framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments  The initiative is part of the 2028-2034 multiannual financial framework proposal.  The Programme offers significant EU added value by establishing and enhancing relationships and cooperation among Member States, third countries, Union institutions, and international organisations that are beyond the reach of individual national authorities.  Possible synergies could be found with the Single Market Programme which will pool measures supported by the EU budget to break down cross-border and cross-country barriers and foster cooperation between national administrations, which Pericles will also contribute to, as well as to the efficient functioning of the single market by guaranteeing the safety of the single currency. Synergies with the European Competitiveness Fund can also found in that the Pericles V programme will also seek to contribute to strategic autonomy and the protection of critical infrastructure by ensuring the safe use of the euro as the single currency and a payment method.  1.5.5.

Comments  Not applicable  2. MANAGEMENT MEASURES  2.1. Monitoring and reporting rules  The monitoring and reporting rules for this programme will follow the requirements laid down in Regulation xxx [Horizontal Performance Regulation]  2.2. Management and control system(s)  2.2.1. Justification of the budget implementation method(s), the funding implementation mechanism(s), the payment modalities and the control strategy proposed  Budget implementation method:  The Programme shall be implemented through direct management by the Commission. This ensures that the Commission is in charge of both the direct management of the Programme and the designing and implementation of EU policy and legislation for the protection of the euro, covering prevention, enforcement and cooperation, allowing an optimal degree of synergy. This guarantees the effective achievement of the objectives of the Programme, since it links legislation and policy with the implementation of the Programme. Participation of the Commission in nearly every action supports preparation and presentation of the EU legislative and policy dimensions.  Funding implementation mechanism:  Financial support under the Programme for eligible actions shall take the form of either:  (a) grants (‘Competent National Authority-implemented actions’), or  (b) public procurement (‘direct actions’).  The Commission makes use of procurement ('direct actions') with an aim to complement the grant actions and therefore meet the highest number of emerging threats and priorities.  The work programme will include all mandatory elements as per Article 110 of the Financial Regulation, including the budgetary allocation.  Payment modalities:  The Commission makes the following payments to the beneficiary:  - one pre-financing payment;  - one payment of the balance, on the basis of the request for payment of the balance.  The aim of the pre-financing is to provide the beneficiary with a float. The pre-financing remains the property of the Union until it is cleared against the payment of the balance. The payment of the balance reimburses or covers the remaining part of the eligible costs incurred by the beneficiary for the implementation of the action.  Control strategy:  The control procedures for both sections of the programme (grants & procurements) are in compliance with the Financial Regulation.  Ex-ante verifications (commitment & payments)  The Commission's choice of a financial circuit is for a partially decentralised model, with financial initiation and verification placed in the central finance unit and operational initiation, verification and final authorisation in the operational units. All files will be verified by at least 4 agents (the financial initiating agent and financial verifying agent in the budget unit and the operational initiating agent and verifying agent in the unit responsible for the expenditure) before they are accepted by the Authorising Officer by sub-delegation.  In all the Pericles procurement files, a Commission representative is present on the day of the action in order to supervise the good implementation of the funds (e.g. conferences and trainings).  Grants  - The grant agreement signed by the beneficiaries defines the conditions applying to the financing and activities resorting under the grant, including a chapter on control methods.  - In most of the Pericles grants, a Commission  representative is present on the day of the action in order to contribute to the event (e.g.: speakers, trainers) and checking the good implementation of the action (e.g. conferences and trainings).  Procurement  - Detailed terms of reference are drafted and form the basis of the specific contract. Anti-fraud measures are foreseen in all contracts concluded between the Commission  and the external party.  - The Commission  performs controls of all deliverables and supervises all operations and services carried out by our framework contractor.  The controls established enable the Commission  to have sufficient assurance of the quality and regularity of the expenditure and reduce the risk of non-compliance. The above mentioned controls reduce the potential risks virtually to zero and reach 100% of the beneficiaries. The programme control strategy is deemed efficient to limit the risk of noncompliance and is proportionate with the risk entailed given the small budget involved.  2.2.2. Information concerning the risks identified and the internal control system(s) set up to mitigate them  The level of risk is considered low for the grant agreements, since for 90% of the cases the beneficiaries are public administrations or law enforcement services in the Member States. For the contracts awarded on the basis of a procurement process the risks are narrowed since an important part of the expenditure is legally and financially covered by a framework contract concluded for 1 year with the possibility to extend 3 times.  In line with the Commission requirements, a risk assessment exercise will be performed each year.  An important risk identified in grant files is the lenient interpretation by the beneficiary of the grant conditions regarding eligibility of costs occurred in the implementation of the action. In order to mitigate this risk an FAQ for Applicants is published in the Funding and Tenders Portal.  Reliability of financial reporting: To ensure a true and fair view of the state of affairs, all payments are subject to a verification of their amounts. Horizontal accounting verification and reporting are also performed.  Safeguarding of assets and information: The pre-financing payments which remain to be cleared show as assets on the balance sheet. Safeguarding is achieved through two main means: the financial capacity of the potential beneficiary is assured since all applicants are selected from a closed group of public bodies and throughout the year the operational unit regularly monitors whether deliverables are received on time.  2.2.3. Estimation and justification of the cost-effectiveness of the controls (ratio between the control costs  and the value of the related funds managed), and assessment of the expected levels of risk of error (at payment & at closure)  The overall cost effectiveness of controls on Pericles expenses will be measured by the proportion of overall costs of controls over the payments. It should be considered that although the control costs ratio will be above average the implementation will be sufficiently efficient and cost-effective. The high control costs ratio can be explained by the following:  The responsible unit is also an active business unit whose activities are intertwined with the implementation of the Pericles actions carried out by Members States and competent national authorities. This is accomplished through the discussion and coordination of MS' Experts Group as well as through the attendance in all events/ workshops/ trainings organised by beneficiaries. Preliminary discussions guarantee the high quality of the outputs to be used for the work of the unit. The participation of Commission  staff in all events mainly relates to its activities as a business unit (chairing, delivering presentations, leading workshops, co-drafting conclusions and consequent use of the outputs) and, at the same time, gives the opportunity to monitor and evaluate on the spot the quality of all actions implemented (max. 15% of the time spent on the spot). In the same context, the Commission  often welcomes participants of Pericles staff exchanges on its premises. These tasks account for a significant amount of time for the unit, most of them are policy related.  Pericles has a relatively small budget, whose implementation and controls are not proportional to the relative low grants awarded, in a similar vein, due to its low budget, the programme cannot benefit from economies of scale.  The programme is carried out through one call for proposal, having two deadlines; therefore two award procedures are managed each year. The objective for the management and control system is to maintain the expected levels of risk of error (at payment & at closure) below the materiality threshold of 2% on an annual basis.  2.3. Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities  See recital 9 of the proposal. In accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509, Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council , Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2988/95 , Council Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96  and Council Regulation (EU) 2017/1939 , the financial interests of the Union are to be protected through proportionate measures, including the prevention, detection, correction and investigation of irregularities and fraud, the recovery of funds lost, wrongly paid or incorrectly used and, where appropriate, the imposition of administrative sanctions. In particular, in accordance with Regulations (Euratom) No 883/2013 and (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) may carry out investigations, including on-the-spot checks and inspections, with a view to establishing whether there has been fraud, corruption or any other illegal activity affecting the financial interests of the Union.

Building on the success of its predecessor, ""Pericles IV,"" the programme aims to maintain the euro's integrity by addressing the threat of high-quality counterfeit currency. It focuses on training and capacity-building for authorities, fostering cooperation among EU member states, and coordinating with other security initiatives to bolster anti-counterfeiting efforts.

A key feature of the proposal is its extension to non-euro member states through a parallel Council Regulation, ensuring a unified approach across the EU. The programme includes actions such as the exchange and dissemination of information, technical and operational assistance, and the purchase of equipment for specialized anti-counterfeiting authorities in third countries. These actions are to be implemented through grants, with the stipulation that equipment purchases are not the sole component of the grant agreement.

Eligible actions under the programme require participation from trainers and/or trainees from at least two member states or third countries, and from at least two professional groups. Funding is available to competent national authorities, and in cases where third countries participate, their appointed authorities are also eligible. The programme will be implemented through work programmes, with specific eligibility criteria potentially outlined further in these programmes.

To ensure the integrity and proper implementation of the programme, all files will be verified by at least four agents before acceptance by the Authorising Officer. The financial framework includes appropriations for",

CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  This proposal provides for a date of application as of 1 January 2028 and is presented for a Union of Member States.  · Reasons and objectives  The Single Market and Customs Programme is part of the post-2027 Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) package and aims to consolidate four individual funding programmes of the current MFF in a new programme to support activities in different policy areas) that  contribute to the smooth functioning of the Single Market, Customs Union, Taxation and Anti-Fraud. The programme will also cover the development, production and dissemination of European statistics, as it is defined in the Regulation (EC) 223/2009.  This programme has the potential to produce synergies with cross-cutting impacts covering several policy areas. It also aims to simplify access to funding for applicants and reduce the overall administrative burden. As a result of  the flexibility, the programme enhances the adaptability and responsiveness to unforeseen needs and should achieve its general and specific objectives more effectively than its predecessors, while ensuring coherence between all its components, ultimately producing greater EU value added.  The Single Market is governed by the fundamental principles of free movement of goods, services, people, and capital and has been a major contributor to growth, competitiveness, and employment. A well-functioning and safe-guarded Single Market is a pre-requisite for a competitive European economy . It has been key to bring ing prosperity , growth and solidarity , and supporting Europe’s resilience and preparedness against unforeseen challenges and crises such as the C OVID -19 pandemic. With a GDP of €18 trillion, the Single Market stands today as the world’s second-largest economy . 1  I n today’s uncertain world and volatile geopolitical challenges , t he importance of the S ingle M arket as our European home market of 450 million people and 26 million businesses is ever increasing . T he Political Guidelines for the 2024-2029 European Commission 2 and the recent reports by Enrico Letta and Mario Draghi stress the need to consolidate and exploit the potential of the S ingle M arket , including research and innovation drivers . 3 .  Moreover, t he Single Market Strategy 4 , the EU Startup and Scaleup Strategy 5 and the Savings and Investments Union Strategy 6 also set out a new approach to create a mor e simple, fair , seamless an d strong European home market with deep capital pools, simplifying regulations, stimulating reforms, removing barriers, including obstacles linked with differences among Member States legislation and administrative procedures, and promoting cross-border trade and investment to boost competitiveness and growth. A key additional condition for the success of the Single Market is an effective cohesion policy and harmonized legislation and administrative procedures.  EU tax policy is key to improving the functioning of the Single Market, its competitiveness and investments, including by avoiding distortions of competition through taxation. Digitalisation and modernisation of taxation are now key-factors to effectively implementing EU taxation policy, and supporting revenue collection for the EU and Member States’ budgets. Coordination on tax matters amongst Member States improve the fight against tax fraud, tax evasion and tax avoidance.  The Single Market is intrinsically linked with the continuously evolving EU Customs Union , which has been safeguarding the EU’s external borders since 1968. The Customs Union remains the foundation of the Union and a fundamental enabler and guardian of the Single Market and other EU political priorities, including contributing to Europe’s economic security strategy. It is key both for collecting duties for the Union budget and for ensuring external border and supply chain security, contributing to safety and security in the European Union.  To make the Customs Union work in practice, the Commission and the customs administrations of the Member States need to design and implement common solutions to common problems. Over the past decades, the responsibilities of Member States’ customs authorities have extended beyond their traditional role of supervising and facilitating EU trade and its economic interests to take on an increasing number of responsibilities in the field of safety and security in order to (i) protect the public against health, environment and civil security threats, and (ii) to  protect European businesses against unfair global competition from non-compliant goods. This broad mandate means the customs administrations are now effectively the lead authority for the control of goods entering the Single Market at the EU's external borders and underpin a highly performing Customs Union, capable of adjusting to challenges such as geopolitical uncertainties and to increasingly volatile international trade patterns.  The Schengen area is a strategic asset of the Union and a key enabler for the free movement of persons and labour mobility and for building resilience through coordinated responses to cross-border security challenges. By eliminating barriers to mobility, Schengen enhances cross-border business activity and plays an important role in advancing the Union’s strategic autonomy, reinforcing its capacity to remain resilient and interconnected in the face of global disruptions.  Safeguarding the Single Market and Customs Union from fraud and illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Union is key.  Article 325 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) establishes shared responsibility between, the Union and   the Member States for countering fraud, corruption and any other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Union. Protecting the financial interests of the Union should cover all aspects of the Union budget, on both the revenue and expenditure sides.  This Single Market and Customs Programme acts as an enabler for the infrastructure of the Single Market. It should encompass a regulatory and operational framework supporting competitiveness and growth covering policy areas such as market surveillance, standardisation, product conformity, consumer protection, intellectual property rights (IPR), public procurement, crisis management, financial services, competition policy, enforcement, implementing tools for administrative cooperation and access to information, and the production, development and dissemination of official European statistics.  In the aforementioned areas, EU level action is required to comply with legal obligations enshrined in the Treaties and secondary legislation. The Member States and the Commission share the responsibility for the correct implementation, application and enforcement of EU law. This includes ensuring compliance with Single Market rules, and respecting people’s and businesses’ rights. The Commission’s work on ensuring compliance in this area combines three main aspects: removing barriers within the Single Market, facilitating collaboration with Member States and facilitating collaboration between Member States; as well as corrective implementation, enforcement actions and stimulating reforms . Developing the tools to support action in these three areas is fundamental for ensuring and improving the functioning of the Single Market and Customs Union.  Furthermore, as part of the integration process for all enlargement countries towards fully functioning market economies, there is a need to support the approximation of legislation, to provide capacity building, including improving operational capacities and to provide targeted awareness raising.  Effectively implementing EU standards, policies and compliance with EU rules governing the Single Market and Customs Union, and cooperation between national authorities constitute challenges to be addressed, to support reforms, collaborative opportunities, human competency building and other initiatives. In particular, to reduce administrative burden on businesses and citizens, Single Market rules should be streamlined and simplified, where relevant, and be further underpinned by collaborative and innovative tools promoting a paperless Single Market.  Considering the interconnections and interactions between the respective policies outlined above, continuous funding must be ensured in the area of the Single Market and Customs Union, to support compliance with EU rules and cooperation among Member States.  The Single Market and Customs Programme addresses these policy needs by bringing together activities financed under four predecessor programmes in the area of (i) the Single Market (including market surveillance, product conformity, standardisation, consumer protection, competition policy, company law, contract law, intellectual property rights, crisis management, public procurement, financial services, and European statistics), (ii) customs, (iii) taxation and (iv) anti-fraud.  This programme integrates the following current programmes:  – parts 7 of the Single Market Programme (SMP) established by Regulation (EU) 2021/690 of the European Parliament and of the Council 8 ,  – t he Customs programme established by Regulation (EU) 2021/444 of the European Parliament and of the Council 9 ,  – the Customs Control Equipment Instrument established as part of the Integrated Border Management Fund by Regulation (EU) 2021/1077 of the European Parliament and of the Council 10 type interventions ,  – the Fiscalis programme established by Regulation (EU) 2021/847 of the European Parliament and of the Council 11 , and  – the Union Anti-Fraud P rogramme established by Regulation (EU) 2021/785 of the European Parliament and of the Council 12 .  Under the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) 2021-2027, the Single Market Programme offers funding opportunities, in line with the Union’s legal obligations, to deliver on a major policy priority of the Union namely the completion of the barrier-free Single Market. Its aim is to protect and empower citizens, consumers, investors and businesses, by enforcing Union law, facilitating market access (while ensuring a high level of consumer protection), and by enhancing cooperation between the competent authorities of Member States and between the competent authorities of Member States and the Commission and the decentralised Union agencies.  Another aim is to develop, produce and disseminate official European statistics that play a pivotal role in informing a wide range of EU policies including the objectives and functioning of the Single Market and the Union’s competitiveness. The European Statistical System is increasingly benefiting from new data sources and technologies that lead to more timely and relevant statistics in support of all EU political priorities. Reliable and comparable European statistics developed, produced and disseminated under the programme pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 are essential for evidence-based decision-making.  The EU Customs and Fiscalis programmes 2021-2027 accompany the customs and tax policies in the EU. Designed as cooperation programmes, both have a heavy digital component and face the same challenges mentioned above, including – on the customs policy side – ensuring adequate funding to secure the functioning of a well performing Customs Union and to address challenges in the digital age. The cross-border nature of infrastructure and services and the focus on system interoperability are evident both in the area of customs and taxation.  The Customs programme 2021-2027 supports the Customs Union and customs authorities working together and acting as one to:  – protect the financial and economic interests of the Union and its Member States,  – ensure security and safety within the Union , and  – p rotect the Union from unfair and illegal trade, while facilitating legitimate business activity.  Approximately 95% of its budget is dedicated to Commission procurement for central digital systems and solutions. The Customs programme also includes components for collaborative and human competency building activities that are at the disposal of all programme participating countries (Member States and candidate/potential candidate countries). These activities work to ensure EU customs authorities work together and act as one.  The Customs programme includes an objective of efficiency gains for EU customs policy and an increase in the agile use of data . 13 In this respect, the future programme will be the transition and implementation vector, aim ing to advanc e on creating efficiencies and moder n digital solutions f or the Customs Union 14 in a more centralised digital environment. Without central supply chain monitoring and control by customs, the EU does not have full visibility on which goods enter and leave its territory. This weakens not only the credibility of the EU sectoral policies, but also limits the EU ’s capacity as a geopolitical actor.  At present there are almost 70 central customs IT systems (developed and operated by the Commission) that form the backbone of the Customs Union. These must be maintained to ensure the uninterrupted operation of the Customs Union, in line with the EU’s legal obligations, up until their overhaul by the EU Customs Data Hub.  T he Customs Control Equipment Instrument (CCEI) , which is part of the Integrated Border Management Fund under the MFF 2021-2027 , shares the same general objective as the Customs programme . Funding under this instrument allows Member States to purchase, maint ain and upgrade of state-of-the-art customs equipment such as scanners, automated number plate recognition systems, sniffer dogs and mobile laboratories for sample analysis etc. Th e objective is to achieve adequate and equivalent results of customs c hecks , essential for the facilitation of legitimate trade, while ensuring sufficient level of protection at the external borders . The Customs R eform P roposal 15 has established the need for the future EU Customs Authority implementing the future CCEI - type interventions for the enlargement countries and addressing any crisis situations for the Member States.  The Fiscalis programme 2021-2027 support s the EU’s objectives for enhancing the functioning of the single market, for fostering the competitiveness of the Union and fair competition in the Union, for protecting the financial and economic interests of the Union and its Member States, including protecting those interests from tax fraud, tax evasion and tax avoidance, and for improving tax collection. In this context, t he programme supports the development, operation and modernisation of the key digital infrastructures for taxation 16 in line with the Commission’s legal obligations established by EU legislation . This represent s around 85% of the 2021-2027 programme’s budget, in the form of Commission procurement . The programme also supports project -based cooperation and human capacity building activities, to implement the EU tax policy objectives including enhancing the functioning of the Single Market . It also puts in place and operate s common tools to facilitate cooperation in the Single Market , particularly in relation to the fight against tax evasion and fraud. The massive rise of artificial intelligence, cryptocurrency, with yet unknown consequences calls for adjusting ambitions and needs for digitalising and updating existing digital systems and infrastructures. Changing tax policies also call for more and better digital solutions to complement the portfolio of the existing 30 established central tax IT systems funded by the programme in line with the established EU level legal obligation s .  The Union Anti-Fraud Programme (UAFP) 17 serves a dual and essential role: it helps the Commission fulfil its obligations under Article 325 TFEU to safeguard the Union budget against fraud, corruption, and other irregularities, while simultaneously supporting Member States in their efforts to uphold the same commitment.  The UAFP has three vital components, each strengthening the EU’s defence against financial wrongdoing.  (1) First, it funds anti-fraud activities across Member States and associated third countries . This in clud es funding investigative equipment and specialised anti-fraud training, aimed at empowering those on the front lines of fraud prevention.  (2) Second, it finances the Anti-Fraud Information System (AFIS), a secure IT platform that enables Member States and the Commission to safely store and exchange sensitive investigative information. This platform is grounded in the legal framework of Council Regulation (EU) No 515/97 18 , which ensures mutual administrative cooperation within the EU as well as with third countries .  (3) Third, it sets up the Irregularity Management System (IMS), which is a specialised part of the AFIS designed for reporting irregularities and suspected fraud to the Commission, in line with sector-specific legislation.  Both the AFIS and the IMS are essential pillars supporting the investigative mandate of OLAF and the Commission’s responsibilities. Their ongoing funding and development are therefore indispensable, ensuring the Union’s and Member States’ continued ability to detect, prevent, and address fraud at every level.  · Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  The importance of the Single Market considering the emerging political challenges is identified in the Political Guidelines and recent reports from Enrico Letta and Mario Draghi. The Political Guidelines 19 highlight the need to deepen the Single Market in general and to create a new momentum to complete the Single Market in sectors like services, energy, defence, finance, electronic communications and digital, research and innovation, and to tackle challenges linked with e-commerce in order to ensure consumers and businesses benefit from a level playing field based on effective customs and tax controls.  The Single Market and Customs programme is consistent with other existing and proposed Union action programmes and funds that pursue similar objectives in related fields of competence.  It contributes to addressing policy priorities for the Single Market and for the Customs Union , in line with the Single Market Strategy, the European Economic Security Strategy 20 , the Commission’s Customs Reform Proposal , European Data Strategy and the Savings and Investments Union Strateg y . A s highlighted by the European Parliament in its Resolution on the 30 th anniversary of the Single Market 21 , th is programm e is designed to be agile and continue to adapt to new challenges and evolving priorities.  The p rogramme is in line with the Single Market Strategy 22 and its objectives to mak e the Single Market simpler, fairer and strong er . The strategy aims to deepen and strengthen a data-based Single Market at the EU and national level , digit al ising administration and reducing administrative barriers, to increase coordination of market surveillance authorities and to improve cooperation with customs authorities , tapping into synergies with capacities of the EU and national customs and market surveillance authorities and potentially establishing an EU Market Surveillance Authority . The actions set out in the strategy will stimulate reform s , make and simplify rules to remove barriers to the free movement of goods and services and improve the implementation and enforcement of Single Market , with which the objectives of th is P rogramme are fully aligned . Shielding the Single Market from the disruptive impacts of crisis requires identifying weaknesses and ensuring appropriate, coordinated and swift responses . The Internal Market Emergency and Resilience Act (IMERA) aims to anticipate, prepare for and respond to the impact of future crise s . It establishes governance structures, a crisis framework, and tools to safeguard the free movement of goods, persons, and services in times of emergency.  The programme will also facilitate the free movement of capital, the access of firms to investment and the competitiveness of the Union’s economy by providing support for the implementation of Regulation 1606/2002 on the application of international financial reporting standards 23 and of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) 24 .  Regulation 1606/2002 requires the incorporation into Union law of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS Accounting Standards) adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board and related interpretations from the IFRS Interpretations Committee, so long as company accounts give a ‘true and fair view’ 25 and that the standards are conducive to the European public good. The programme will, therefore, continue Union support for the development of IFRS Accounting Standards and for the work of EFRAG 26 in assessing whether the requirements for their incorporation into Union law are satisfied.  The programme will also allow continued support for EFRAG’s involvement in the development of European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) in accordance with the CSRD.  The programme is consistent with the Union Customs Code 27 , the Commission’s proposal on the Customs Union Reform 28 and other legislation that the customs authorities apply. T h e p rogramme is furthermore in line with and supports the EU E conomic S ecurity S trategy 29 . It is consistent with the objective to support the functioning and modernisation of the C ustoms U nion in order to strengthen the S ingle M arket by means of cooperation between participating countries, their customs authorities and their officials.  Th e pro gramme will provide the operational, organisational, methodological and budgetary framework to implement EU customs policy objectives and activities. While the p rogramme incorporates the current stand-alone Customs programme, it is expected to maintain coverage for the interventions and objectives relevant for the Customs Union . It will have a critical role of ensuring the transition to the future EU customs policy landscape, introduced by the proposal of the Customs Union Reform , which includ es the establishment of an EU Customs Authority and the development and operation of an EU Customs Data Hub as well as operation of the legacy customs digital systems up until their overhaul by the EU Customs Data Hub . T he legacy customs digital systems must continue to be maintained up until they are replaced by the EU Customs Data Hub. T he programme will also integrate the 2021-2027 CCEI 30 type targeted interventions to be implemented by the new EU Customs Authority , pri marily to support the enlargement countries and address crisis situations .  The programme is in line with the Commission agenda to ensure a fair and efficient tax system in the Union with a view, inter alia, to enhancing the functioning of the Single Market, to fostering competitiveness and fair competition in the Union; protecting the financial and economic interests of the Union and its Member States, including protecting those interests from tax fraud, tax evasion and tax avoidance, and improving tax collection. Many of the initiatives adopted in this framework aim at increasing tax transparency and enhancing administrative cooperation, through measures such as the exchange of relevant tax information.  T he new p rogramme incorporates the current stand-alone Fiscalis programme, but is expected to maintain the same Fis c alis interventions and objectives. It will therefore provide the budgetary and other means to support and implement these regulatory interventions . Important features of this administrative cooperation are the relevant European electronic systems, which enable Member States tax authorities to exchange information on the implementation of the ‘ VAT in the Digital Age package ’ 31 , the Directive on Administrative Cooperation ( DAC ) 32 , the Faster and Safer Tax Relief of Excess Withholding Taxes Directive ( FASTER ) 33 and other priorities . Through the anti-fraud activities that it promotes, th is new p rogramme directly address es several of the EU ’ s priorities, as fraud , corruption and other illegal activities directly undermine the E U ’s goals in areas like financial stability, economic growth, rule of law, and public trust. T he funded anti-fraud initiatives will also advance other Commission policy priorities, particularly in relation to the enhanced digitalisation of national law enforcement authorities.  The p rogramme is expected to deliver substantial EU added value by co-financing activities aimed at improving the cross-border collection and exchange of data as well as providing Member States with EU-level intelligence on emerging patterns of fraud . The support provided for anti-fraud measures will promote cooperation and optimise the utilisation of Member States’ resources in the prevention and detection of fraud, corruption and other illegal activities , thereby safeguarding EU taxpayers’ funds. In the context of the ongoing review of the EU Anti-Fraud Architecture 34 , the programme will thus contribute to a strengthened and more efficient anti-fraud architecture to protect the EU’s financial interests .  · Consistency with other Union policies and initiatives  The programme is consistent with other proposed EU policies that pursue similar objectives in related fields of competence.  It aims for a strong integrated Single Market, which is critical for European competitiveness , resilience and economic security , as highlighted by the Competitiveness Compass , the 2025 Single Market and Competitiveness Report 35 , and the 2025 Single Market Strategy . The challenges underpinning competitiveness in all this are simplification, stimulating reforms, removing barriers in the Single Market, enabling more efficient financing and ensuring better coordination for implementation of shared EU policy objectives at EU and national level.  Activities under the programme are complementary and seek synergies with other proposals for EU action programmes under the next MFF such as National and Regional Partnership Plans, the European Competitiveness Fund, Horizon Europe and Global Europe . Actions supported by the programme seek to improve the functioning and shielding the external borders of the Single Market and Customs Union as the home market for EU industry and businesses and a vector for competitiveness. Similarly, actions supported by the programme to improve administrative and operational capacity through cross-border cooperation among Member States including EU level digital solutions and human competency building projects complement actions developed by Member States under the National and Regional Partnership Plans. Moreover, the programme is consistent with existing cohesion policy tools for addressing administrative and legal barriers hampering the functioning of the Single Market, such as the BridgeforEU Regulation.  Moreover, EU competition law has an essential role to play in ensuring the proper functioning of the single market, as is recognised explicitly in both the Treat y on the EU (TEU) and the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) 36 . The effectiveness of competition policy in the single market is in turn an essential driver of EU competitiveness, as competition stimulates productivity, investment and innovation . In the coming years the field of competition enforcement will face new or growing challenges, including at the global level, which are likely to significantly increase both threats to competition and, the complexity of enforcement.  The programme is also consistent with the Joint White Paper on Defence Readiness and the Commission Political Guidelines, which stress the importance of building a true European Single Market for defence products and services for achieving defence readiness.  The p rogramme also supports Union’s ambition on sustainability including climate , energy and environmental objectives and social responsibilities that are often delivered through product specific legislation or trade arrangements. It is consistent with the objectives of the European Green Deal and the Clean Industrial Deal , by ensuring the proper control of products being placed on the Single Market in relation to their compliance with environmental standards. The p rogramme may also support measures related to the polluter pays principle, including through green taxes. The p rogramme may also support customs authorities in the greening of their own operations. The programme is consistent with the CBAM 37 provisions.  The programme aims to make the Single Market and Customs Union more effective in the era of digitalisation providing funding to assist the digitalisation of services and businesses and facilitates Single Market access and international cooperation. Digital tools are fundamental for effective policy implementation and for supporting reforms. The programme will aim at increasing the relevance and timeliness of European statistics while limiting the reporting burden through leveraging new data sources and ethical use of digital technologies, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), implementing the once-only principle and further digitalisation of data collections.  To ensure consistency and complementarity of EU action, the programme should be implemented in synergy with other Union programmes, in particular the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) . Coordination with CEF – Transport should be promoted, especially in areas where customs digitalisation intersects with physical infrastructure investments, such as smart border crossings, multimodal logistics hubs, and cross-border transport corridors, including military mobility.  The free movement of persons, including for the purpose of employment, is one of the fundamental freedoms of the Single Market. While this programme does not directly support labour nor learning mobility, it complements Union instruments such as Erasmus+ and the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+), which contribute to facilitating lifelong learning mobility, mutual recognition of qualifications, and cross-border skills development. These instruments support the practical realisation of the free movement of people and help address labour market imbalances across the Union. A well-functioning housing market is also vital to ensure labour mobility . The present programme contributes to the legal, regulatory, and administrative framework underpinning this freedom, including by fostering cooperation between competent authorities and supporting rule enforcement in the Single Market.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  · Legal basis  The proposed new programme is expected to continue the interventions of the 2021-2027 programmes which will be merged, with some adjustments, into one programme, therefore keeping their respective legal bases. The legal bases of the programme are:  – Article 33 TFEU on customs cooperation in the Customs Union;  – Article 114 TFEU on achieving the objectives of the internal market;  – Article 169 TFEU c oncerning consumer protection;  – Article 197 TFEU on administrative cooperation ;  – Article 207 TFEU on common commercial policy;  – Article 325 TFEU on the protecti o n of the financial interests of the Union ; and  – Article 338 TFEU on statistics .  · Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  The EU faces global competition from other major economic blocs and needs to ensure that the Single Market remains competitive, performing, accessible and innovative and provides a level playing field for stakeholders. A more flexible and streamlined funding system could boost the Single Market’s global competitiveness and the level playing field.  The EU’s funding landscape needs to be resilient and agile to respond to emerging crises and changing needs and to adapt to the digital transition and rapid technological change. Rigid rules make it difficult to redirect funds quickly or pivot to new priorities and hamper the EU’s ability to tackle urgent issues.  More flexible funding boosts collaboration and cross-border projects . C ooperation and harmonisation offer transnational and cross-border   benefits and economies of scale for national authorities in the implementation of EU policies and for businesses, consumers, investors and citizens. Streamlined rules and faster approval processes could help share knowledge and co-develop solutions to challenges such as continuously evolving trade patterns, climate change, and digital transformation.  Today’s challenges require a collective and coordinated EU response due to their global nature and a high level of interdependence between Member States. This highlights the importance of coordinating policy actions. EU level funding is also essential to enable the Commission to fulfil its legal obligations (under the TFEU and related legislation) and address Single Market and Customs Union issues falling in its competence. It is also essential to support cooperation among Member States to fulfil their legal obligations (under the TFEU and related legislation) regarding the functioning of the Single Market in a number of areas, such as customs, market surveillance, product conformity, standardisation, consumer protection, public procurement, crisis management, taxation and anti-fraud. Moreover, the objectives of providing reliable, relevant and comparable European statistics necessary for performing Union activities cannot be achieved by Member States acting alone. Setting a programming framework at EU level is needed. The programming framework for European statistics will be implemented by coordinated statistical actions and partnership between Eurostat and the national statistical authorities, as foreseen in Regulation (EC) 223/2009 on European statistics. Hence, action at EU level is necessary to ensure that accompanying measures to ensure and improve the functioning of the Single Market are in place, complementing actions developed at Member States level.  Although the Customs Union is an area of EU exclusive competence with a single Union Customs Code 38 39 , the implementation of this legislation remains entirely with the Member States. The Customs Union can therefore only be as strong as its weakest link . Strong operational cooperation , including digital integration , is key to enable customs authorities to act as one and to ensure correct collection of customs duties , import VAT, excise , other duties and levies and to cover the non-financial tasks of increasing importance .  In the tax area , a versatile and complex legal and digital landscape, efforts on harmonisation and approximation of tax law and administrative actions, as well as rapidly emerging needs prompt the demand for EU interventions, inviting for support Member States in their effort and responsibility to implement Union law. A significant part of the EU tax legislation requires modern digital solutions to be put in place for allowing exchanging information in relation to taxpayers (citizens or businesses) or cross-border transactions, including on cryptocurrency. This exchange of information amongst Member States takes place because EU funding allows financing EU-level electronic systems, or their common components. Without such financial support no common electronic systems would be developed, and many EU legislative acts would remain unimplemented, or their implementation would suffer from important delays and technical obstacles.  Union action is needed to underpin the European dimension of single market, customs, taxation and anti-fraud authorities work, to avoid internal market distortions and to support the effective protection of the Union external borders. EU level funding is essential to enable the Commission to fulfil its various legal obligations (under the TFEU and related legislation) and address Single Market and Customs Union issues falling in its competence.  In addition,  g iven the strong digital dimension of the policy areas covered by the programme, strengthened collaboration between public sector organisations at EU, national, regional and local level across the EU is necessary to facilitate seamless data exchanges to improve policy implementation and reduce the administrative burden.  Consequently, this programme can only be established at EU level as the actions require active cooperation and coordination between Member States.  · Proportionality  The programme will help to effectively enforce and modernise the Union legal framework and to adapt it rapidly to the ever-changing environment. This will be done, among other things, through data-gathering and analyses, studies, evaluations and policy recommendations, administrative, operational (including digital), and capacity-building activities, a more centralised digital environment and joint actions between Member States and between their competent authorities and the Commission. The programme will also strengthen the exchange and dissemination of expertise and knowledge, support harmonised standard setting and contribute to rulemaking, implementation, monitoring and interpretation of EU law. It will also support mechanisms allowing individuals, consumers and business representatives to contribute to decision-making processes.  None of the actions goes beyond what is absolutely necessary to achieve the programme’s objectives in enhancing and deepening the functioning of the Single Market and a strong Customs Union, and protecting the financial and economic interests of the EU and its Member States.  T he actions are based on analysis of actual needs on the ground but also taking into account the legal requirements in the policy areas covered by the programme. The European Commission will exercise coordinating, executive and management functions, as laid down in the Treaties.  The European statistics programming framework will be implemented according to the principles of cost-effectiveness and limiting administrative burden, leveraging emerging technologies and re-use of existing administrative, publicly and privately available data sources.  Consequently, the objectives of the programme will be achieved in a much more proportionate manner at EU level than at the level of the Member States.  Section 3.3 of the Impact Assessment describes the European Union value added of the programme.  · Choice of the instrument  As the impact assessment concludes, EU action through a funding programme is appropriate.  Merging the four existing programmes into one single programme will improve the consistency and integration of actions in the respective policy areas. At the same time, it will reduce the number of divergent and fragmented financing rules and will streamline the implementation. In accordance with the legislative policy the Commission has adopted under the MFF, the funding programme is proposed as a Regulation.  3. RESULTS OF RETROSPECTIVE EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  · Retrospective evaluations of existing legislation  The programme builds on findings and lessons learned from the finalised and ongoing evaluations of its predecessor programmes.  The interim evaluation of the Single Market Programme (SMP) showed nuanced conclusions for the first three years of implementation (2021-2023). T he evaluation conclude d that the programme’s key activities contributed to a large extent to the achievement of its general and specific objectives. T he SMP has partially delivered on the flexibility and synergies 40 expected from designing an integrated programme .  P reliminary findings from the interim evaluations of the 2021-2027 Fiscalis and Customs 41 programmes , also confirm their overall positive contribution towards the objectives, while indicating that there is room for further simplification in the monitoring and evaluation framework procedures . The final evaluations of the 2014-2020 Customs and Fiscalis programmes have concluded the overall positive benefits of the EU level programme interventions 42 .  In line with Article 13 of Regulation 2021/785 43 on the U nion A nti- F raud P rogramme (UAFP) , the Commission ’s anti-fraud office (OLAF) performed an interim evaluation of the UAFP for the period between January 2021 and January 2024 44 , based on an external study 45 . The evaluation concluded that the UAFP effectively reduces the EU’s financial exposure to fraud and is aligned with broader goals, emerging fraud trends, and EU policy priorities, particular ly further digitalis ing fraud combating services . Its first component (‘Hercule’) enhances investigative and technical capacities through grants for equipment acquisition and training actions, which have resulted in high beneficiary satisfaction rates. Its anti-fraud information system ( AFIS ) facilitates fraud-related information exchange between EU and national law enforcement agencies, to a level that exceeds performance targets. Its irregularity management system ( IMS ) is an essential tool for reporting, tracking and monitoring irregularities or suspected fraud related to EU (structural) funds, and the user satisfaction with th is system is high. The UAFP remains relevant, as it is aligned with broader goals, emerging fraud trends, and EU policy priorities, particular ly further digitalis ing fraud combating services.  · Stakeholder consultations  A public consultation on EU funding for the single market, and cooperation between national administrations took place between 12 February and 7 May 2025. It targeted a wide range of stakeholders, including citizens, businesses, SMEs, public authorities, recipients of EU funding, civil society organisations, consumer organisations, academia, and international stakeholders. It included an online questionnaire and the option to submit position papers. In total, 747 survey responses and 161 position papers were received from EU citizens, public authorities, non-governmental organisations, and other stakeholders (including government bodies, banking institutions, chambers of commerce), predominantly from European countries. This input informed how the Commission designed this legislative proposal.  The most widely recognised challenges pertaining to the Single Market and cooperation between national authorities included (i) ensuring that rulemaking, standard setting, and enforcement at the EU level remain evidence-based, effective, and tailored to evolving needs; (ii) improving cooperation and collaborative efforts between Member States and the Commission; and (iii) empowering stakeholders by addressing knowledge and data gaps.  The respondents considered it important to address all the challenges identified, including regulatory fragmentation, differences in the interpretation of EU legislation, and the fragmented and complex digital environment. Additional challenges identified by respondents in an open-ended follow-up question include excessive bureaucracy and regulatory fragmentation, uneven enforcement of EU rules across Member States, and a need for greater harmonisation in areas such as taxation, accounting, environmental standards, and digital regulation.  Respondents to the public consultation expect policies in the scope of the public consultation to address to the highest extent the following challenges: improving cooperation, collaborative efforts, and integration; empowering stakeholders by addressing knowledge and data gaps; and overcoming barriers and ensuring evidence-based and adaptive EU rulemaking and enforcement.  As regards the structure and procedural barriers limiting the effectiveness of the EU budget in achieving its objectives, the most relevant challenges were administrative burdens, and fragmented and complex rules for accessing funding and compliance.  Respondents showed broad support for simplifying procedures and improving the design of funding instruments. The highest levels of support were expressed for simplifying access to and information about funding for beneficiaries and clearer, fewer and simpler rules.  The most important areas of EU-level action identified are: supporting fair competition; supporting standardisation efforts; and deploying common and/or interoperable digital solutions. When asked about other potential strategic areas to be covered by a well-functioning single market, Customs Union, and related measures, some respondents emphasised the need for harmonised tax and customs rules, reduced administrative burdens – especially for SMEs – and stronger digital infrastructure and cybersecurity across the EU. Member State authorities placed higher importance than other groups on several areas, including deploying common and/or interoperable digital solutions and supporting EU economic security.  Replies also indicated that an EU-level action would provide the most added value by supporting cross-border and multi-country projects and cooperation; strengthening the competitiveness and sustainability of EU businesses; and addressing transnational challenges.  Detailed results of the public consultation are presented in the Impact Assessment (Annex 2) accompanying the legal proposal.  Last, in accordance with the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 on European statistics, the draft programming framework for European statistics as set out in the Annex has been submitted to the European Statistical System Committee for prior examination.  Impact assessment  The impact assessment analysed the following two overall scenarios for the design of the programme:  (1) Integrated scenario  Under this scenario, current programmes related to Single Market, Customs Union, taxation, and anti-fraud policies would be brought together under a flexible framework with one single legal proposal. Further harmonisation of legal provisions would deliver a single, more streamlined flexible framework while still maintaining a clear division between existing programmes and policy areas. This scenario preserves existing policy objectives and governance models, avoiding disruptions and ensuring continuity. A horizontal programme structure could promote flexibility, simplification and more synergies. Bringing together programmes with a cross-thematic nature, including their complex and diverse activities, requires strengthened coordination and governance.  (2) Unified scenario  This scenario would consolidate policy priorities in the area of the Single Market, Customs Union, taxation, and anti-fraud policies, including cooperation between national authorities, in a single legislative act with one set of legal and institutional requirements for all activities.  Bringing together all concerned policy areas, objectives and expected results and impacts, the programme architecture and implementation procedures would ensure budget security for legal obligations as well as more flexibility and adaptability to emerging needs and shifting priorities.  A unified scenario was considered the preferred option. It was considered to best address all identified problems and problem drivers (both in terms of the programme design and the policy areas covered), bearing in mind that – along with simplifications and synergies - more flexibility is key in guaranteeing the budget’s ability to respond to a changing reality.  The impact assessment received an ‘opinion without qualification’ from the Regulatory Scrutiny Board on 13 June 2025. The Board’s recommendations were addressed in the revised version of the impact assessment.  · Simplification  The programme brings together four predecessor programmes notably, the Single Market Programme (excluding the SME and ‘food and feed’ pillars), the Customs programme including the CCEI-type interventions, the Fiscalis programme and the Union Anti-Fraud Programme  It will make it possible to streamline actions across a broader range of policy areas, thereby building and exploiting more synergies between the various actions and provide a more flexible and agile financing framework aimed at enhancing and deepening a well- functioning Single Market and a strong Customs Union, protecting the financial and economic interests of the EU and its Member States, most cost-efficiently. Public authorities (including competent authorities at national level) will benefit directly from better policymaking and law enforcement thanks to capacity building, enhanced cooperation and streamlined administrative procedures further enhancing policy synergies.  Stakeholders are expected to benefit from simplifications in the programme design, e.g. with joint procurement, or joint framework contracts, and from horizontal activities that would otherwise not take place at the same level. Simplification and flexibilities in the programme design and the implementation of new horizontal activities will make policy development and law enforcement more effective and will allow new or better services to be provided to citizens, consumers and businesses. Programme management may also be less burdensome for the Commission, and beneficial to applicants, facilitating access to funding as well as minimising administrative burden, for instance with harmonised legal provisions, common reporting templates, a single set of requirements, or a common rulebook.  · Fundamental rights  The programme ensures the full respect of the rights and principles set out in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and in other international human rights conventions to which Member States and the Union are party to, such as the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and contributes to the implementation of several of those rights. Its objectives are notably to ensure citizens’ health (in accordance with Article 35 of the Charter) and consumer protection (in accordance with Article 38 of the Charter). It also contributes to the right to effective remedy and fair trial as prescribed by Article 47 of the Charter. The programme also aims to improve the freedom to conduct a business in accordance with Union law and national laws and practices (Article 16 of the Charter).  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  On 16 July 2025, the Commission adopted a proposal for the next Multiannual Financial Framework for the period2028-2034. In accordance with this proposal, this Regulation contains a budgetary framework of EUR 6 238 112 000 (in current prices) for the period 2028-2034.  5. OTHER ASPECTS  · Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  The programme will be implemented under direct management in accordance with the Financial Regulation, particularly through grants and procurement (some of which will potentially be managed by an executive agency), and/or under indirect management with bodies referred to in Article 62(1), first paragraph, point (c), and Article 157/158/159.  The Commission’s C ustoms R eform proposal – under negotiation s between the co-legislators – s pecifies that the Commission may entrust the EU Customs Authority with tasks for implementing of the customs-related funding programmes such as the development, operation and maintenance of the EU Customs Data Hub . The Authority may also be tasked with activities relating to the allocation, funding and procurement of customs control equipment, including the assessment of needs, joint procurement and co- sharing of equipment 46 .  The 2025 Single Market Strategy presents several actions to address structural problems and improve the governance of the Single Market in the policy areas of standardisation, conformity assessment and market surveillance and, to take effective action to increase product compliance by tapping into synergies between the EU and national customs and market surveillance authorities and potentially establishing an EU Market Surveillance Authority.  · Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  The scope of the programme covers the area of the Single Market and cooperation between national administrations in a comprehensive manner. The general objective of the programme is to enhance and deepen the functioning of the Single Market and a strong Customs Union, to protect the financial and economic interests of the EU and its Member States, with a design fostering flexibility, simplification and synergies.  The programme will be open to participation by the Member States, European Free Trade Association (EFTA) members which are the members of the European Economic Area (EEA), acceding countries, candidate countries and potential candidate countries. In line with overall Union policy, countries covered by the European Neighbourhood Policy and other non-EU countries will also have the possibility to take part in the programme under certain conditions. In addition, the programme will be open to Switzerland in accordance with the conditions established in the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on cooperation in the field of statistics.  The programme will be implemented through public procurement and grants .  Generic types of actions will apply to all specific objectives. These include:  – d igital capacity building, development and operation of centralised and decentralised European electronic systems and digital solutions , implementation tools and data  – s upport for policy and regulatory work ( studies, communication, impact assessment, evaluation and simplification proposals etc.)  – c ollaboration and cooperation between Member States , the Commission, EU agencies and national authorities , as well as cooperation between Member States, the Commission and third countries  – a dministrative and o perational/technical capacity building ( including purchase , maintenance, upgrade of equipment – notably customs control equipment – infrastructure etc. and related costs )  – human competency building , including training  – development of joint tools, methods, data and statistics to support policy making  _            other actions to achieve the general and specific objectives (innovation, testing etc.).  In implementing actions to deliver on the European statistics programming framework, synergies will be developed within the European Statistical System through collective networks by sharing expertise and results or by fostering specialisation on specific task. The outcomes of those actions, such as joint tools, methods and infrastructures, will be made available throughout the European Statistical System.  Implementation of the programme should be based on annual or multiannual work programmes. The mid- to long-term nature of the objectives pursued and the need to build on experience gained over time, work programmes may cover several years. Multiannual work programmes will reduce the administrative burden without hampering the implementation of the programme.  2025/0590 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  establishing the Single Market and Customs Programme for the period 2028-2034 and repealing Regulations (EU) 2021/444, (EU) 2021/690, (EU) 2021/785, (EU) 2021/847 and (EU) 2021/1077  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articl e 33, Article 114(1), Article 169(3), Article 197(2), Article 207(2), Article 325(4), Article 338(1) thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the Court of Auditors 47 ,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 48 ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) This Regulation lays down a n indicative financial envelope for th e ‘Single Market , and Customs Programme for the period 2028-2034 ’ ( the ‘ p rogramme’ ) . For the purpose of this Regulation, current prices are calculated by applying a fixed 2% deflator.  (2) In a rapidly changing economic, social and geopolitical environment, recent experience has shown the need for a more flexible multiannual financial framework and Union spending pr ogrammes. To that effect, and in line with the objectives of this regulation, the funding should consider the evolving policy needs and Union’s priorities as identified in relevant documents published by the Commission, in Council conclusions and Parliament resolutions while ensuring sufficient predictability for the budget implementation.  (3) Regul ati on (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 of the European Parliament and of the Council 49 applies to th e p rogramme. It lays down the rules on the establishment and the implementation of the general budget of the Union, including the rules on grants, prizes, non-financial donations, procurement, indirect management , financial assistance, financial instruments and budgetary guarantees.  (4) In accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509, Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council 50 , Council Regulation s ( EC, Euratom) No 2988/95 51 , ( EC, Euratom) No 2185/96 52 and (EU) 2017/1939 53 , the financial interests of the Union are to be protected through proportionate measures, including the prevention, detection, correction and investigation of irregularities and fraud, the recovery of funds lost, wrongly paid or incorrectly used and, where appropriate, the imposition of administrative sanctions. I n accordance with Regulation s (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 and ( EC, Euratom) No 2185/96 , the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) may carry out investigations, including on-the-spot checks and inspections, with a view to establishing whether there has been fraud, corruption or any other illegal activity affecting the financial interests of the Union. In accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017/1939, the European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO) may investigate and prosecute fraud and other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Union as provided for in Directive (EU) 2017/1371 of the European Parliament and of the Council 54 . In accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509, any person or entity receiving Union funds is to fully cooperate in the protection of the Union’s financial interests, to grant the necessary rights and access to the Commission, OLAF, the EPPO and the European Court of Auditors and to ensure that any third parties involved in the implementation of Union funds grant equivalent rights.  (5) The p rogramme is to be implemented in accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) 202 5 /XXXX of the European Parliament and of the Council 55 establishing a budget expenditure tracking and performance framework and other horizontal rules for the Union programmes and activities , including rules for ensuring a uniform application of the principles of ‘do no significant harm’ and gender equality referred to in Article 33(2), points (d) and (f), of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 respectively , the principles of preparedness and climate resilience by design, rules for monitoring and reporting on the performance of Union programmes and activities, rules for establishing a Union funding portal, rules for the evaluation of the programmes, as well as other horizontal provisions applicable to all Union programmes such as those on information, communication and visibility.  (6) Pursuant to Article 85(1) of Council Decision (EU) 2021/1764 56 , persons and entities established in overseas countries and territories (OCTs) are eligible for funding under the p rogramme and subject to possible arrangements applicable to the Member State to which the relevant overseas country or territory is linked.  (7) T he S ingle Market is governed by the fundamental principles of free movement of goods, services, people, and capital and has been a major contributor to growth, competitiveness and emp loymen t . A well-functioning and safe-guarded Single Market is a pre-requisite for a competitive , safe and secure Union economy and for advancing the Savings and Investments Union . A s stressed by the new approach proposed by the Single Market Strategy , more action is needed to address the barriers , stimulate reforms, reduce fragmentation and complete the Single Market , especially in the context of new global challenges .This has been and will continue to be reinforced by an effective cohesion policy as an additional key condition for the success of the Single Market. The Member States and the Commission share the responsibility for enforcing Union law to ensure compliance with Single Market rules and to protect people’s and business es ’ rights. The Union -level responsibility combines three main aspects: removal of barrier s , collaboration between Member States, and corrective implementation and enforcement actions and stimulating reforms . Barriers such as knowledge and data gaps , and gold plating are obstacles for citizens, consumers, businesses, investors, economic operators to access and operate within the S ingle M arket . Capacity building, administrative and operational cooperation , including digital cooperation, and integration among Member States and between Member States and the Commission remain suboptimal and could be reinforced to improve efficiency and a level-playing field. Low efficiency and lack of flexibility in rulemaking, standard setting and enforcement may hamper their adaptability . There is a need to combine the infrastructure accompanying and enabling the lifting of internal barriers and the infrastructure protecting the external borders of the Single Market.  (8) Under the multiannual financial framework for the years 2021 to 2027 laid down in Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2020/2093 57 , t he Single Market Programme ( ‘ SMP ’ ) established by Regulation (EU) 2021/690 of the European Parliament and of the Council 58 supports the design, implementation and enforcement of Union legislation underpinning the proper functioning of the Single Market , so that it can reach its full potential . The Customs programme established by Regulation (EU) 2021/444 of the European Parliament and of the Council 59 and the Fiscalis programme established by Regulation (EU) 2021/847 of the European Parliament and of the Council 60 accompany the customs and tax policies in the Union by supporting Union level digital solutions for customs and taxation, project based collaborative activities as well as human competency building activities . In addition, the Customs Control Equipment Instrument established as part of the Integrated Border Management Fund by Regulation (EU) 2021/1077 of the European Parliament and of the Council 61 , contributes to increasing the efficient and effective customs controls, essential for the facilitation of legitimate trade, while ensuring sufficient level of protection at the external borders . The Union Anti-Fraud Programme ( ‘ UAFP ’ ) established by Regulation (EU) 2021/785 of the European Parliament and of the Council 62 funds actions which aim to prevent and combat fraud, corruption and other illegal activities such as money-laundering , affecting the Union 's financial interests and to foster Member States’ cooperation in this field among one another and with the Commission .  (9) W ith economic and security uncertainty caused by geopolitical challenges and trade tensions, the Single Market is our anchor for stability and resilience . T h o se challenges require a collective and coordinated Union response considering their scale and the high levels of interdependence among Member States and regions . I n addition, an adequate level of protection and resulting benefits for citizens, consumers , investors and businesses could not be achieved solely through actions at national level , nor could it generate economies of scale , especially given the cross-border nature of th o se benefits.  (10) Union funding is required to enable the Commission to meet legal obligations of the Union that cannot be delegated to Member States, ensuring obligations under Union law are fulfilled , in particular in the areas of customs, market surveillance, product conformity, consumer protection, financial services, standard setting, competition policy, the provision of European statistics, taxation and anti-fraud .  (11) It is therefore appropriate to establish a p rogramme to enhance and deepen the functioning of the Single Market and a strong Customs Union and to protect the financial and economic interests of the Union and the Member S tates, with a design fostering flexibility, simplification and synergies , and supporting the horizontal policy mainstreaming priorities including what is set out in Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2025/XXXX of the European Parliament and of the Council 63 establishing a budget expenditure tracking and performance framework and other horizontal rules for the Union programmes and activities . The following four programmes should therefore be merged in one single p rogramme : parts of the Single Market Programme, excluding the small and medium-sized enterprises and food and feed strands, the Customs programme, including the Customs Control Equipment Instrument type interventions, the Fiscalis programme and the Union Anti-Fraud programme. A continuous and agile funding should be ensured in the area s of the Single Market, customs, taxation and anti-fraud, including funding for cooperation between national administrations encompassing activities such as streamlin ing administrative processes, harmonis ing rules across Member States, or facilitat ing quicker responses to evolving challenges with a comprehensive preparedness and crisis-response framework .  (12) In this regard, t he p rogramme should enable the implementation of the following generic types of actions : (a) digital capacity building, development and operation of centralised and decentralised European electronic systems and digital solutions, implementation tools and data; (b) support to policy, regulatory and enforcement work, for example, through studies, communication, impact assessment, evaluation and simplification proposals; (c) collaboration and cooperation between Member States, the Commission, Union agencies and national authorities and with stakeholders ; (d) administrative and operational/technical capacity building, including purchase, maintenance, upgrade of equipment – notably customs control equipment – infrastructure and related costs; (e) human competency building; ( f ) joint tools, methods, data and statistics to support policy making (g) other actions to achieve the general and specific objectives, such as innovation, testing.  (13) In light of the growing digitalisation of the economy and society, t here is a n increasing need for citizens, consumers, investors, economic operators, businesses, and public administrations to have timely, accurate and a ccess ible information and advice on the functioning of the Single Market and their rights and obligations under Union law. Furthermore , reinforced cooperation and integration to ensure digitally enabled, seamless implementation, consistent and effective enforcement across the Union and to prevent barriers and limitations hindering the proper functioning of the Single Market , tax ation , anti-fraud policies and the Customs Union should be enabled . Union authorities and bodies should maintain effective rulemaking, standard setting, as well as implementation and enforcement of Union law in the face of changing circumstances and to ensure enforcement of restrictive measures in the management of Union funds.  (14) The p rogramme should therefore further improve the functioning of the Single Market , including the external dimension, protect and empower citizens, consumers and businesses . Th at should be achieved by developing, implementing and enforcing Union law, offering digital tools and solutions , facilitating market access and public procurement, ensuring resilience , management of emergencies and security threats or crisis , s tandard s etting , and supporting the development of the Union regulatory f ra m e work . Th e p rogramme ’s actions should cover the areas of intellectual property rights, company law , anti-money laundering , and contract law, and by ensuring a high level of consumer protection , including protection of passenger rights, and market surveillance , financial literacy, the free movement of capital and financial services, effective and efficient competition enforcement , customs, anti-fraud , effective and efficient enforcement of Union restrictive measures and taxation . The p rogramme should also enhanc e cooperation between the competent authorities of Member States and the Commission, in parti cular cooperation and increased synergies between various national authorities, including national enforcement bodies, as well as cooperation between Member States , the Commission and third countries, including by providing digital solutions to improve information sharing among national authorities and with relevant stakeholders. It should allow to develop, produce and disseminate high-quality, comparable, timely and reliable European statistics . There is a need to implement cohesive digital solutions that facilitate and simplify doing business in the Union and with third countries and seize opportunities offered by the Single Market and Customs Union for citizens , consumers , investors and businesses , while respecting the Union’s climate objectives . Union coordinated platforms ensure cooperation among Member State’s authorities reducing fragmentation and duplication of efforts. Digital implementation tools reduce administrative burdens and create transparency . Different tools are designed to create synergies that facilitate and simplify doing business in the Union and in their international trade operations , enhancing day-to-day efficiency for businesses, fostering greater economic integration and drive innovation throughout the Union .  (15) European statistics are essential, as they underpin the design, monitoring and evaluation of all Union policies and empower all members of society to make informed decisions and to actively participate in the democratic process. Relevant and comparable official European statistics should be produced and disseminated to provide valuable insights and address knowledge gaps, allowing citizens, consumers, investors and businesses to benefit fully from the Single Market . In view of its horizontal character, the legal framework for the development, production and dissemination of European statistics established by Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council 64 is subject to specific requirements, and in particular those laid down in that Regulation, with regard to respect for statistical principles, as well as the functioning of the European Statistical System and its governance, including the role and tasks assigned to the European Statistical System Committee and to the Commission (Eurostat), and the establishment and implementation of the programming of the statistical activities.  (16) The p rogramme should ensure that the interests of consumers, including the end users of financial services, are represented at the Union level so that developments in the Single Market also respond to their needs and foster investor trust in the Single Market .  (17) The p rogramme aims to foster consumer and investor trust in the Single Market and the Customs Union by ensuring a high-level of consumer protection , including the protection of passengers, product safety and consumer empowerment , thereby enabling consumers to fully benefit from the Single Market and to contribute to a competitive, innovative, and dynamic Single Market. The p rogramme should safeguard consumers’ safety and rights as well as their legal and economic interests through concrete and effective measures which support, supplement and monitor the policy implemented by the Member States. Moreover, consumers should be empowered and encouraged to make sustainable and informed c hoices . It is necessary to ensure that consumer protection , rights and product safety requirements are effectively i mplemented, uniformly enforced, and consistently upheld across the Union, thereby contributing to the creation of a level-playing field for consumers , investors and businesses. Consumer organisations at both national and Union -level play a crucial role in promoting the interests of consumers, representing the interests of consumers in policy making, providing independent advice , raising awareness, and supporting consumers, in particular in-court and out-of-court in dispute resolution and in helping them understand and exercise their rights effectively. The p rogramme should strengthen the role and capacity of consumer organisations and European Consumer Centres to enable them to offer tailored guidance and advice to individual consumers . Furthermore , the p rogramme should support cooperation between national competent authorities, including those entrusted with the enforcement of consumer law and operating in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017/2394 and those carrying out enforcement tasks with regard to passenger rights in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2021/782, Regulation (EU) No 181/2011, Regulation (EU) No 1177/2010, Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 and Regulation (EC) No 1107/2006 . Capacity building measures are required to adapt investigation techniques and enforcement tools to the technological developments, such as the use of arti ficial intelligence. Measures are also necessary to strengthen the capacity of, and cooperation between market surveillance authorities responsible for monitoring product safety, notably through the Union’s Safety Gate Rapid Alert System for dangerous products operating in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2023/988 of the European Parliament and of the Council 65 and the Information and Communication System for Market Surveillance (ICSMS) under Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 of the European Parliament and of the Council 66 .  (18) Activities in market surveillance are instrumental in meeting the objectives of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 of the European Parliament and of the Council 67 and other Union legal acts requiring the Commission to recognise accreditation bodies and support networks . Such activities should improve the cooperation between Member States and support the harmonisation of ways of working and e-commerce surveillance. Market surveillance activities contribute to protect ing competitiveness of Union businesses, consumer safety and facilitate cross-border collaboration and sharing of expertise. Market surveillance ensures that non-food products on the Union market do not endanger Union consumers and workers. It also ensures the protection of other public interests such as  environment al protection and climate action , security and fairness in trade. Market surveillance has an important role to play in helping the EU delivering its Green Deal agenda, for example by ensuring that prohibitions and restrictions related to sustainability are properly implemented on imported products. The governance of the Single Market could be improved to address structural problems in the area of standardisation, conformity assessment and market surveillance . The Single Market Strategy proposes to t ake effective action to increase product compliance by tapping into synergies with capacities of the EU and national customs and market surveillance authorities and potentially establishing an EU Market Surveillance Authority .  (19) European standards play a pivotal role in fostering harmonisation across the Union and supporting key policy objectives . It is essential to ensure Union interests are represented in international standardisation landscape . Harmonisation of standards and digital regulation can address the fragmentation in Union rulemaking and enforcement as a barrier to a well-functioning Single Market. The p rogramme should deliver stronger coordination mechanisms, harmonised regulatory standards, and enhanced Union-level oversight.  (20) The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union ( TFEU ) includes a system of rules ensuring that competition is not distorted in the internal market and provides that the Union has exclusive competence in establishing competition rules. The p rogramme should contribute to the Union’s competition policy and , in particular, tackle the significant implications for competition and the functioning of the S ingle M arket resulting from the clean , just , competitive and digital transition of the economy and business environment . Using the right technology and skills to monitor markets, collect, process and analyse information more effectively is crucial for strengthening and speeding up the enforcement of competition rules . Th o se technologies should modernise competition policy and help to enhance the analysis and assessment of market developments. It is also essential that the p rogramme supports networks, reinforces cooperation with national authorities and courts, strengthens international cooperation, and ensures an outreach to a wider group of stakeholders in communicating and explaining the rights, benefits and obligations of the Union’s competition policy. The p rogramme should contribute to fair competition and a level playing field, including at global level, and empower businesses, and consumers to reap the benefits of the S ingle M arket. Overall, th at should also contribute to achieving the significant macroeconomic impacts of effective Union competition enforcement.  (21) The p rogramme should support the development and implementation of high-quality European and international corporate financial and non- financial reporting standards and a well-functioning common  reporting framework which are essential for the internal market, for the effective functioning of the capital markets and for the realisation of the integrated market for financial services in the context of the Savings and Investment s Union.  (22) The development of the Union regulatory framework in the areas of c ompany law and corporate governance, and contract law, is essential to mak e businesses more efficient and competitive, while providing protection for stakeholders affected by company operations, and to re spond to emerging policy challenges . The support to appropriate evaluation, implementation (including digital development) and enforcement of the relevant acquis , which inform and assist stakeholders , facilitate secure information exchange and ensure legal certainty with regard to the companies in the Single Market . The upcoming European Innovation Act and 28 th 68 regime for companies will directly contribute to the Union competitiveness. A clear and well-adapted legal framework for the data economy and innovation is necessary including digitalisation and sharing between companies and administrations using the European B usiness W allet , the Single Digital Gateway or other digital means for placing products in the Single Market such as the Digital Product Passport . It would enhance legal certainty with regard to contractual and extra contractual obligations, in particular with regard to liability, security, ethics and privacy in the context of advanced and emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence and quantum technologies. .  (23) The Customs Union remains the foundation of the Union and a fundamental enabler and guardian of the competitive Single Market and other Union political priorities , including European economic secu rity . The Customs Union is instrumental in implementing the Union’s commercial policy, in protecting the financial and economic interests of the Union and its Member States as well as ensuring safet y and security within the Union . I n response to the need to address the challenges , including the necessity to facilitat e legitimate international trade, the Customs Union and the related economic operators, as well as the national customs authorities face, i n light of the evolution of their role and of the business models in which they operate , on 17 May 2023, the Commission put forward a proposal 69 for the most ambitious and comprehensive reform of the Customs Union since its establishment in 1968. A more cost-efficient and effective cooperation framework governing the Customs Union is to be established , based on a new partnership among customs authorities and between customs and business es , and by establishing the EU Customs Authority which should devel op and manage the EU Customs Data Hub .  (24) Union tax policy plays a key role in the seamless functioning of the competitive internal market . I t support s consistent tax practices across Member States, fostering a level playing field and minimi s ing barriers to cross-border trade. Union tax policy does not only combat fragmentation and discrimination but also safeguards the financial interests of the Union and its Member States, promoting economic growth and encouraging investment within a competitive framework. Tax policy also contributes to the EU’s climate and environmental objectives. Fighting tax fraud, tax evasion and tax avoidance through enhanced cooperation and exchange of information is crucial for safeguarding th os e interests, alignment with the Union 's wider objectives and maintaining the trust of citizens and businesses in the integrity of the internal market. An efficient functioning of the S ingle M arket also requires simplification of tax systems and digitali s ation of public administrations to improve transparency and consistency, thereby promoting a competitive economic environment across Member States. Acknowledging the impact of digitali s ation on public administrations, including tax authorities, Union tax policy should leverage th o se digital opportunities to ensure fair taxation and efficient tax collection while offering a leaner and more efficient framework that reduces compliance burdens.  (25) In line with the established and future legal commitments at Union level , it is crucial to continue developing and operating Union components of digital solutions in the customs and taxation fields . Th o s e common components are essential for establishing a modern and efficient Customs Union and tax systems across the Union , and for enhancing the Union ’ s competitiveness at global level.  (26) The p rogramme should enable the continuation of the Customs programme including customs control equipment support interventions deployed in the 2021-2027 period by the Customs Control Equipment Instrument , and the Fiscalis programme and their predecessors. In th at respect, t he p rogramme should enable the continuation of supporting the work of the customs and tax authorities not only by ensuring a solid digital customs and tax environment but also by reinforcing expert networks, the shar ing of know-how and good practices, as well as by complementing the national efforts for training customs and tax officials and professionals with U nion level solutions . In that sense, the p rogramme should support the continued collaboration and cooperation between the national customs authorities as well as between national tax authorities and their cooperation with the Commission and with other national authorities, and their digital, administrative, human and operational capacity building (development and operation of electronic systems and digital solutions and tools, equipment, infrastructure, training, innovation, studies, evaluations , etc.). The importance of ensuring adequate and equivalent results of customs controls , – amongst other aspects – calls for the availability and optimal use of relevant and state-of-the-art customs control equipment, which should be facilitated by the p rogramme , in particular in case of crisis situations and in the countries neighbouring the Union’s external borders. Joint procurement should be encouraged as much as possible to achieve further efficiencies and economies of scale. The p rogramme should also enable the transition to a renewed Customs Union 70 .  (27) T he p rogramme should also contribute to ensuring th at EU customs control systems are equipped and interoperable to facilitate the smooth movement of military goods and equipment , in the light of the growing importance of military mobility . To this end, support could be pro vided for the digitalisation and coordination of the customs procedures, including the enhancement of civil-military customs cooperation.  (28) In accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509, the work programmes and the call documents are the appropriate place to set out more technical implementation details for the budget across the set of policies supported by the p rogramme, including specific eligibility and award criteria depending on the instrument of budget implementation, whether grant or procurement, and the specific policy objectives pursued. In accordance with Article 136 of the Financial Regulation, security requirements should be applied. Rest ric tions to high-risk supplier s should apply according to the relevant applicable provisions .  (29) Europe must protect its security interest against suppliers which could represent a persistent security risk due to the potential interference from third countries as well as their security, notably cybersecurity. It is therefore necessary to reduce the risk of persisting dependency on high-risk suppliers in the internal market, including in the ICT supply chain, as they could have potentially serious negative impacts on security for users and companies across the Union and the Union’s critical infrastructure in terms of the integrity of data and services as well as the availability of service. This restriction should be based on a proportionate risk assessment and associated mitigation measures as defined in the Union policies and laws.  (30) Union legislation setting out rules for Union funds under shared management and for pre-accession assistance regarding the programming period for the years 2014 to 2020 and onwards provides for an obligation on Member States, candidate countries and potential candidate countries to report irregularities and fraud affecting the financial interests of the Union. Based on that legislation and on related implementing regulations, the Commission is obliged to maintain the Irregularity Management System (IMS) as a secure electronic communications tool, which also supports the management and analysis of irregularities.  (31) Article 325 TFEU requires the Union and the Member States to counter fraud , corruption and any other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Union. The Union should support activities in those fields. In accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 515/97 71 and Council Decision 2009/917/JHA 72 the Union is to support mutual assistance between the administrative authorities of the Member States and cooperation between the latter and the Commission, to ensure the correct application of the law on customs and agricultural matters. That support covers not only anti-fraud activities in relation to customs fraud but also in relation to illicit trade in the fields of safety and security, health and the protection of the environment and is provided to a number of operational activities. Th o se include the Anti-Fraud Information System (AFIS), an information technology platform which consists of a set of applications operated under a common information system , managed by the Commission. Th at common information system comprising AFIS and IMS requires stable and predictable financing over the years in order to ensure its sustainability , which should be made available under the p rogramme, given the Commission’s legal obligations in th at respect and the importance of the system for the protection of the Unions and the Member States economic and financial interests.  (32) Third countries which are members of the European Economic Area (‘ EEA ’) may participate in the p rogramme in the framework of the cooperation established under the Agreement on the EEA 73 , which provides for the association to the programmes on the basis of a decision adopted under that Agreement. Third countries may also participate on the basis of other legal instruments. T hird countries should be required to grant the necessary rights and access required for the authorising officer responsible, OLAF and the Court of Auditors to comprehensively exercise their respective competences.  (33) In line with the Commission’s commitment to ensure the coherence and simplification of funding programmes, set out in its Communication of 11 February 2025 on ‘The road to the next multiannual financial framework’ 74 , resources should be shared with other Union funding instruments if the actions envisaged under the p rogramme pursue objectives that are common to various funding instruments, excluding double financing. Actions under the p rogramme should ensure coherence in the use of the Union’s resources supporting tax policy and tax authorities .  (34) Since the objectives of this Regulation , namely to enhance and deepen the well-functioning of a competitive Single Market and a strong Customs Union, and to protect the financial and economic interests , security and the safety of the Union and its Member States , cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States alone but can rather , by reason of legal obligation, scale and effects of the action , be better achieved at Union level, t he Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.  (35) T he draft part of the p rogramme regarding the framework for the development, production and dissemination of European statistics has been submitted for prior examination to the European Statistical System Committee in accordance with Article 13(4) Regulation (EC) No 223/2009.  (36) T h is Regulation replaces the p rogrammes established by Regulation s (EU) 2021/444, (EU) 2021/690, (EU) 2021/785, (EU) 2021/847 and (EU) 2021/1077 . T hose Regulations should therefore be repealed .  (37) To ensure the continuation of fulfilment of actions related to Union legal obligations and other actions or modification of the actions carried out under th ose Regulations , until their closure, transitional arrangements should be laid dow n ,  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Article 1 Subject matter  This Regulation establishes the Single Market and Customs Programme (the ‘programme’) and lays down the objectives of the programme, its budget for the period from 1 January 2028 to 31 December 2034 , the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding.

The programme should enable the implementation of the following generic types of actions: (a) digital capacity building, development and operation of centralised and decentralised European electronic systems and digital solutions, implementation tools and data; (b) support to policy and regulatory work, for example, through studies, communication, impact assessment, evaluation and simplification proposals; (c) collaboration and cooperation between Member States, the Commission, Union agencies and national authorities; (d) administrative and operational/technical capacity building, including purchase, maintenance, upgrade of equipment – notably customs control equipment – infrastructure and related costs; (e) skills development, human competency building (training); (f) development of joint tools, methods, data and statistics to support policy making; (g) other actions to achieve the general and specific objectives, such as innovation, testing.  1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, greater effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this section 'added value of EU involvement' is the value resulting from EU action, that is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.  Reasons for action at EU level (ex-ante): The EU faces global competition from other major economic blocs and needs to ensure that the Single Market remains competitive, performing, accessible and innovative and establishes a level playing field for stakeholders. A more flexible funding system — where programmes adapt to different needs and are easier to navigate for stakeholders — can foster and boost the single market’s global competitiveness and level playing field as well as strengthen the Customs Union. Flexible funding structures make it easier for stakeholders to collaborate across borders. In addition to streamlining, the EU’s funding landscape needs to display resilience and agility to respond to emerging crises situations — such as recently witnessed pandemics or energy shocks to adapt to digital transition and rapid technological change and to contribute to economic security. Intervention at EU level provides cooperation and harmonisation at EU level and offers relevant transnational and cross-border benefits and economies of scale for businesses, consumers and citizens, as well as national authorities. EU level funding is also needed to enable the Commission to fulfil its legal obligations (TFEU and related legislation) and address Single Market issues falling in its competence, as well as the Customs Union, EU taxation policy and the anti-fraud related priorities.  Funding with a focus on single market activities is essential to advance EU-wide objectives and facilitate the implementation of EU legislation across Member States. It generates an EU added value that funding at Member Stateational level could not achieve alone.  Expected generated EU added value (ex-post):  The programme’s EU added value is to enable the implementation of actions pursuing the specific objectives seeking to address the (1) knowledge and data gaps, gold plating and other barriers which are obstacles for citizens, consumers, investors and businesses, and investors to access and operate in the Single Market; (2) the need for capacity building, administrative and operational cooperation and integration among Member States and between Member States and the European Commission, which remains suboptimal; and the (3) need to ensure the effectiveness of EU rulemaking, standard-setting and enforcement at EU level.  To continue the support at EU level is essential to improve the functioning of the single market by enforcing Union law, and facilitating market access . EU action protects and empowers citizens, consumers and businesses. It helps them to adjust to the reforms and policy changes necessary for the functioning of the single market by providing information, advice tools and services.  Digital tools reduce administrative burdens and create transparency for citizens, consumers and businesses. Portals dedicated to single market topics provide information or helps businesses or citizens and consumers affected by breaches of EU law to obtain out-of-court redress, enabling them to overcome barriers. They overall help advance a paperless Single Market.  Similarly, EU coordinated platforms in different Single Market areas are needed to ensure cooperation among Member State’s authorities reducing fragmentation and duplication of efforts. These platforms enable to enhance co-operation between civil society organisations, businesses, entrepreneurs and industry bodies. Member States and the Commission can co-invest to develop key digital interoperability enablers for innovative cross-border digital public services. For instance, the structured collaboration between high level representatives from Member States through the Interoperable Europe Act 87 governance will steer public authorities’ digital transformation and cross-border interoperability.  European trans-European services and platforms enable cross-border data sharing and collaboration between national authorities, investors, businesses, and consumers , delivering benefits that individual Member States may have neither the incentive nor capacity to establish independently.  A coordinated response at the EU level avoids the risk of overlapping efforts, which would occur if Member States would independently provide information and advisory services to businesses and consumers on the single market.  Similarly, in the area of customs and taxation it has been confirmed that the EU level intervention, deployed under the current MFF via Customs including the CCEI, and Fiscalis programmes, is achieving efficiencies of scale in general and efficiency gains in IT capacity building, operational capacity building, while the collaborative activities and human competency building (including training) are providing opportunities for cooperation, communication and networking across the EU that could not be achieved without the EU level action and are essential to ensure harmonisation. Implementing common components of digital systems at EU level contributes to mitigating the challenges of national customs and tax administrations’ unequal capacities in terms of IT infrastructure and equipment availability, human resources and operational processes, uneven interpretation and implementation of relevant legislation by customs and tax administrations, and geographic, administrative, legal and strategic obstacles to cooperation. Equally so, supporting the acquisition of the customs control equipment in the enlargement countries (and for addressing crisis situations) will strengthen the Customs Union and Single Market.  The current Union Anti-Fraud Programme (UAFP) brings significant EU added value in the field of protecting the EU’s financial interests against fraud, corruption or any other irregularities, as identified by the programme’s interim evaluation. UAFP funding proved to be a vital resource helping Member States stay up to date with the latest technologies, equipment and expertise needed in their fight against fraud and other offences detrimental to the EU’s financial interests.  In the context of the EU Anti-Fraud Architecture, coordination with Member States and the Commission is essential in addressing increasingly complex cross-border fraud having an impact on the financial and other interests of the EU. Coordinated operational activity, EU-level anti-fraud intelligence and administrative tools to exchange sensitive investigative-related information including with third countries, are essential tools that strengthen the Union’s Customs Union and Single Market.  The Irregularity Management System (IMS) is the only database in the EU that consolidates reported information about irregularities, including fraud, in the shared management and pre-accession funds. It allows for various types of analyses and helps further develop an evidence-based EU anti-fraud policy. Through the analyses developed by OLAF, it also feeds into the Member States’ fraud risk assessments  Regarding the Single Market areas falling in the scope of the programme, the EU also has exclusive competence in respect of establishing and enforcing competition rules necessary for the functioning of the single market and with significant  macroeconomic impacts. Digital tools (for case work, investigations, secure exchange of information) and studies are necessary conditions for effective and efficient enforcement of competition rules. The effective enforcement of EU competition policy, which has a significant positive impact on customer savings and on the EU economy overall, requires the Commission to have the necessary expertise and digital tools to support its enforcement activities. The necessary expertise is necessary to modernise the EU's competition policy to ensure it supports European companies to innovate, compete and lead world-wide.  EU-level coordination as regards policies related to businesses , is by nature based on a cooperation between Member States and the Commission, which could not be triggered on the national level alone. These instruments should continue to address gaps in financing, stimulate growth, enhance competitiveness across the EU and contribute to harmonising such approaches across the Member States. They should also continue to ensure that the interests of consumers and investors, including the end users of financial services, are represented at the European level so that developments in the single market also respond to their needs.  The production of European standards is crucial to align standards with EU legislation. It is also important to keep ensuring stakeholder participation in international standard-setting (for example in the area of corporate financial and non-financial reporting standards involving EFRAG and the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation).  Standardisation activities allow to replace 27 national standards with a harmonised standard, setting common rules across the single market.  This harmonisation is crucial, as not all Member States share the same level of interest or are equally affected by specific policy initiatives due to diverse geographical, climate, environmental, industrial, financial and commercial factors.  Activities in market surveillance are instrumental in meeting the objectives of the   legal requirements. They aim to enhance the effectiveness of market surveillance, improve the cooperation between Member States, harmonisation of ways of working and e-commerce surveillance. Market surveillance activities avoid that the less resourceful Member States would become the weak links of the single market, via which all kind of dangerous product could enter the single market and circulate freely. This would threaten the competitiveness of EU businesses, but also consumer safety. Market surveillance includes financing joint testing of products and facilitates cross-border collaboration and sharing of expertise. EU Testing Facilities for products are an example of initiatives that demonstrates how EU-wide approach minimises duplication and creates economies of scale.  The programme should provide significant EU-added value by ensuring consumers across the EU have access to fair, effective, and cross-border dispute resolution. European Consumer Centres (ECC) Network and Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) mechanisms activities contribute to reducing legal costs, strengthening enforcement, and enhancing consumer confidence in the single market. The programme would support cross-border initiatives that national efforts alone could not achieve.  European statistics have strong EU added-value, due to their impartiality, reliability, and comprehensive coverage, as well as to their significantly improved comparability and harmonisation across EU Member States. Activities enable to align statistical data production standards, ensuring high-quality, comprehensive, and reliable statistics.  1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past  The interim evaluation of the Single Market Programme (SMP) showed that the potential for flexibility, synergies, and simplification, resulting from its integrated design, has not been fully exploited. The feasibility of initiating more joint actions was pointed out as an area of improvement, as well as the simplification of the eGrants tool.  There is a need for information evidenced during the interim evaluation of the SMP by the effectiveness and level of use of digital information tools (Your Europe, Your Europe Advice (YEA)) and services. The SMP interim evaluation showed it is crucial continue to focus on raising consumer education and awareness of consumer law, especially in countries where evidence suggests gaps, with specific emphasis on financial literacy and digital rights. Significant progress is still needed, notably for making procedures accessible to cross-border users. Communication and knowledge sharing between different stakeholders was assessed satisfactory by the interim evaluation of the SMP, nevertheless, it can be further improved.  There is also a need for continuous action to strengthen the financial literacy of citizens and raise awareness regarding aspects of the financial services that affect consumers in their day-to-day life such as the increase of digitalisation and digital finance or savings and financial planning through retail investments. This will also contribute to further the Savings and Investments Union.  There is a need to continue investing in new technologies and innovative data sources, expanding data coverage and granularity, to enhance timely European statistical production and dissemination.  In some policy areas, there is sub-optimal administrative cooperation and integration between Member States and between Member States and the European Commission that impacted consistent levels of enforcement of EU policies, law and rules. To avoid the creation of de facto barriers to free movement there is a need for reinforced operational and administrative cooperation and integration between authorities, and between the national administration and the Commission.  In the area of anti-fraud, administrative cooperation and effective anti-fraud tools to support investigation activities, as well as to prevent and detect fraud, is essential to allow Member States and OLAF, as well as third countries, to exchange sensitive operational information in a safe and timely manner to address fraud at an early stage to prevent losses to the Union budget. It is also vital to reinforce and develop the AFIS and IMS infrastructures, allowing an enhancement of the data management and data exploitation functionalities. This would increase the operational capacity of Member States investigations and data analyis in fraud prevention and detection activities.  The setting of standards necessitates support for European Standardisation Organisations (ESOs). Harmonised European standards allow economic operators to demonstrate compliance with EU law with one standard across the single market.  Capacity building for Consumer Protection Cooperation (CPC) authorities, other public authorities enforcing consumer rights and ADR bodies is required, backed by regular needs assessments to keep pace with evolving legislation. Upskilling of ADRs will be essential to tackle new categories of consumer disputes, making workshops and events for exchanging best practices essential. Enhance cooperation among Member States to address the fragmented ADR landscape across EU and promote collaboration among sector-specific ADR networks. This will help reduce administrative challenges by sharing resources, exchanging best practices.  In line with the established legal commitments at Union level, it is crucial to continue developing and operating Union components of digital solutions in the area of customs and taxation . Those common components are essential for establishing a modern and efficient Customs Union as well as tax systems across the Union and for enhancing the Union’s competitiveness at global level. The Programme should enable the continuation of the Customs programme including customs control equipment support interventions , and of the Fiscalis programme. In this respect, the p rogramme should enable the continuation of supporting the work of the customs and tax authorities not only by ensuring a solid digital customs and tax environment but also by reinforcing expert networks, the sharing of know-how and good practices, as well as by complementing the national efforts for training (human competency building) customs and tax officials and professionals with Union level solutions. In that sense, the Programme should support the continued collaboration and cooperation between the national customs authorities as well as between national tax authorities and their cooperation with the Commission and with other national authorities, and their digital, administrative, human and operational capacity building (development and operation of electronic systems and digital solutions and tools, equipment, infrastructure, training, innovation, studies, evaluations etc.). The importance of ensuring adequate and equivalent results of customs controls – amongst other aspects – calls for the availability and optimal use of relevant and state-of-the-art customs control equipment, which should be facilitated by the Programme, in particular in case of crisis situations and in the p countries neighbouring the Union’s external borders. Joint procurement should be encouraged as much as possible to achieve further efficiencies and economies of scale. In this way, the Programme should also enable the transition to a renewed Customs Union 88 .  1.5.4. Compatibility with the multiannual financial framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments  There is no significant duplication or overlap with other EU policies or programmes.  The Programme is consistent with other proposed Union action programmes and funds that pursue similar objectives in related fields of competence.  Activities under the Programme are complementary and seek synergies with several proposals such as National and Regional Partnerships, the European Competitiveness Fund, the Horizon Europe and the Global Europe Fund .  1.6.

Comments  Indirect management may be used on occasion in the course of the programme, if a specific need arises and indirect management represents the most adequate way of funding, e.g. international organisations, public law bodies. In the field of customs, indirect management will be used with the involvement of the EU Customs Authority, in line with the approach established in the EU Customs reform proposal under negotiations between the co-legislators. The proposal stipulates that the Commission may entrust to the EU Customs Authority tasks for the implementation of the customs-related funding programmes such as the development, operation and maintenance of the EU Customs Data Hub and activities relating to the allocation, funding and procurement of customs control equipment, including the assessment of needs, joint procurement and co-sharing of equipment.  In the policy areas of standardisation, conformity assessment and market surveillance, the 2025 Single Market Strategy presents several actions to address structural problems and improve the governance of the Single Market  and to take effective action to increase product compliance by tapping into synergies between the EU and national customs and market surveillance authorities considering “EU level market surveillance in strategic priority areas, notably concerning e-commerce imports from third countries where measures taken by individual Member States may not be sufficient and potentially establishing an EU Market Surveillance Authority.  2. MANAGEMENT MEASURES  2.1. Monitoring and reporting rules  The monitoring and reporting rules for this programme will follow the requirements laid down in Regulation xxx [Performance Regulation].  2.2. Management and control system(s)  2.2.1. Justification of the budget implementation method(s), the funding implementation mechanism(s), the payment modalities and the control strategy proposed  The programme shall be implemented under direct management or indirect management. Part of the actions will be implemented by the Commission services with the possibility for delegation to an executive Agency and implementation by decentralised authority(ies).  Union funding may be provided in any form, in particular grants,  procurement, non-financial donations, and remuneration and reimbursements to experts . Joint procurement shall be encouraged to achieve further efficiencies and economies of scale.  All methods of funding can potentially be applied, including simplified forms of grants (lump sums, unit costs, flat rate financing) and financing not linked to costs. This ensures maximum flexibility for the duration of the Programme.  Specific rules for eligibility for funding are limited to a minimum in order to give full flexibiliy to the development of crosscutting and joint actions in the course of the programme. Specific provisions are made only where the continuation of existing funding structures with proven added value and impact requires it.  Where the programme ensures continuity of ongoing actions, the envisaged implementation methods and internal controls are identified by the Commission Services currently responsible for the activities concerned. In specific:  Activities related to competition will be implemented mainly through procurement under direct management, in particular for the financing of IT projects. This includes effective IT-governance processes, which actively involve the systems’ users.  In the field of contracts/grants awarded in the area of financial services, financial stability and capital markets union and Savings and Investments Union, the Programme will be implemented under direct management. There will be a constant link with policy work on financial services including Savings and Investments Union which, in specific fields, depends on the outputs of the contracts/grants funded under the programme. Such management mode ensures the necessary flexibility for adapting the programme to actual policy needs in an area subject to frequent changes.  The management mode for the provision and dissemination of statistics is central direct management by the Commission. From a financial point of view, the programme will be implemented by awarding contracts mainly in the domains of statistics and IT services, and via grants mainly donated to national statistical authorities. The standard payment modalities of the European Commission will be applied. A multi-annual control strategy covering the lifetime of the programme will be established in order to reduce the risks related to the financial transactions of the programme to an acceptable level taking into account its cost-efficiency. The control strategy will foresee a combination of mandatory ex ante controls with complementary ex post controls.  The part of the programme that concerns consumer policy, company law, contract law and anti-money laundering will be implemented through mainly through public procurements and grants under direct management. Direct management enables effective monitoring of programme objectives and implementation by providing greater flexibility for modifications and adjustments, including those related to evolving policy needs. Some activities under the consumer policy will be carried out through indirect management, involving cooperation with international organisations such as the OECD and UNCTAD. Actions related to consumer policy may be implemented by an Executive Agency, mainly through grants although procurement activities will also be possible.  The Single Market Strategy 2025 presents the possibility to take effective action to increase product compliance by tapping into synergies with capacities of the EU and national customs and market surveillance authorities and potentially establishing an EU Market Surveillance Authority  The Commission’s Customs Reform proposal – under negotiations between the co-legislators – stipulates that the Commission may entrust to the EU Customs Authority tasks for the implementation of the customs -related funding programmes such as the development, operation and maintenance of the EU Customs Data Hub and activities relating to the allocation, funding and procurement of customs control equipment, including the assessment of needs, joint procurement and co-sharing of equipment. Some parts of interventions will remain under direct management by the Commission, notably the management of the legacy digital systems, until they will be integrated in the EU Customs Data Hub. Under direct and indirect management, there will be grants to the national customs authorities as well as procurement, including related to human competency building activities.  Activities related to taxation will be implemented mainly through procurement under direct management, in particular for the financing of IT projects but also human competency buiding activities. This includes effective IT-governance processes, which actively involve the systems’ users.  Intervention will be complemented by grants involving national taxation authorities.  Some procurement activities will be managed directly by the Commission, as this allows to better adapt to the needs of the policy and will allow for instance to do legislative conformity checks, studies, and implement some prerogative activities of the Commission.  2.2.2. Information concerning the risks identified and the internal control system(s) set up to mitigate them  The internal control framework is built on the implementation of the Commission's Internal Control Principles, procedures for selecting the best projects and translating them into legal instruments, project and contract management throughout the project lifecycle, ex-ante checks on claims, including receipt of audit certificates, ex-ante certification of cost methodologies, ex post audits and corrections, and evaluation.  The internal control processes on the authorisation of expenditure are aimed to ensure the adequate management of the risks relating to the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions, and the nature of payments. Furthermore, the control system consists of different building blocks, such as reporting to senior management, ex-ante verification by central financial team, internal advisory committee for procurements and contracts, ex-post controls and audits from the Internal Audit Service and the European Court of Auditors.  2.2.3. Estimation and justification of the cost-effectiveness of the controls (ratio between the control costs  and the value of the related funds managed), and assessment of the expected levels of risk of error (at payment & at closure)  A cost-effective internal control system will be ensured by the responsible authorising officer. The objective for the internal control system is to maintain the expected levels of risk of error (at payment & at closure) below the materiality threshold of 2% on an annual basis.  It is estimated that the cost of controls will remain below 10%   of total expenditure and is expected to decrease .  2.3. Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities  The financial interests of the Union must be protected through proportionate measures throughout the expenditure cycle, including the prevention, detection and investigation of irregularities, the recovery of funds lost, wrongly paid or incorrectly used and, where appropriate, administrative and financial penalties. Effective anti-fraud actions require active cooperation, including knowledge-sharing and information exchange, between the relevant involved authorities at both national and EU levels. Where necessary, such cooperation may also extend to third countries.  In addition to these general measures, and given that the programme will be implemented by several Commission Directorates - General, including by executive and decentralised authorities, each entity will apply measures for the prevention of fraud and irregularities that are most suited to the policy and intervention areas under their responsibility.  The Commission maintains robust antifraud strategy, complemented by the local antifraud strategies of the Commission services that cover the activities falling under their remit. The Commission or its representatives shall have the power of audit, based on documents and on the spot, over all grant beneficiaries, contractors and subcontractors who have received Union funds. OLAF is  authorised to carry out on-the-spot checks and inspections on economic operators concerned directly or indirectly by such funding.  The Court of Auditors and the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (‘the EPPO’) and, for the processing of personal data, the European Data Protection Supervisor have the same rights as the contracting authority, particularly right of access, for the purpose of checks, audits and investigations.  The Commission also implements a series of measures such as:  - decisions, agreements and contracts resulting from the implementation of the programme will expressly entitle the Commission, including OLAF, EPPO and the Court of Auditors to conduct audits, on-the-spot checks and inspections;  - during the evaluation phase of a call for proposals/tender, the proposers and tenderers are checked against the published exclusion criteria based on declarations and the Early Detection and Exclusion System (EDES);  - the rules governing the eligibility of costs will be simplified in accordance with the provisions of the Financial Regulation.  - regular training on issues related to fraud and irregularities is given to all staff involved in contract management as well as to auditors and controllers who verify the beneficiaries' declarations on the spot.  3.

Such new data sources include among others: · Privately held data, such as location data from mobile network operators or web data on enterprises or on labour market trends. · Administrative data held by European or national administration These provisions are in line with the principles of the European Data Strategy , and specifically with its emphasis on facilitating use of privately-held data by government authorities and the sharing of data between public authorities. The implementation of these new provisions aims to reduce administrative burden on citizens and businesses by reducing reliance on traditional surveys and by making sure that the ‘once only’ principle is respected. The necessary regulatory, administrative, technical and organisational measures are in place for European statistics to protect the security and integrity of statistical data and their transmission, in accordance with best practices, international standards, as well as European and national legislation. Strict protocols apply to external users accessing statistical microdata for research purposes. The data sought from businesses is, as far as possible, readily available from their accounts and electronic means are used where possible to facilitate its return. Administrative and other data sources are used whenever possible to avoid duplicating requests for data. Data sharing and data integration, while adhering to confidentiality and data protection requirements, are promoted to minimise response burden. Row 8 — Competition policy; Business-related information, case-investigation information; To enforce EU competition rules, the European Commission manages ever-increasing amounts of data, sometimes involving millions of documents or even several terabytes of information in a single case. This requires substantial infrastructure to handle the documents’ lifecycle —requesting, receiving, registering, and storing information. Moreover, many documents contain Sensitive Non-Classified information, which must be handled with strict confidentiality.

This initiative consolidates four existing funding programs into a single, streamlined effort, focusing on improving the movement of goods, services, people, and capital across the EU. The proposal seeks to simplify access to funding, reduce administrative burdens, and enhance adaptability to unforeseen needs, particularly in today's uncertain geopolitical climate.

Key principles upheld by the program include 'do no significant harm' and gender equality, with provisions for preparedness and climate resilience. It also includes rules for monitoring and reporting on performance and supports overseas countries and territories linked to EU Member States, ensuring their eligibility for funding. The proposal emphasizes the need for more action to address barriers, stimulate reforms, and reduce fragmentation, especially in light of new global challenges.

The program has specific objectives, such as empowering citizens, consumers, investors, economic operators, and businesses by providing information, guidance, and advice to make informed decisions and fully access the opportunities of the Single Market. It aims to foster cooperation among Member States' national authorities and between these authorities, the Commission, and other Union bodies. The program will support the design, implementation, and enforcement of Union legislation underpinning the Single Market, customs, and tax policies.

A significant component of the proposal is the development and integration of European electronic systems for customs and taxation. These systems are designed",

CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  Farming and food are strategic sectors for the Union, providing safe and high-quality food to 450 million Europeans at affordable prices and playing a key role for European as well as global food security. At the same time, they are essential for sustaining the economy and life in rural areas, as well as an important part of the solution in the protection of climate, nature, soils, water, and biodiversity currently under stress. The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is at the heart of the European project and has committed more than 60 years ago to ensuring food security and a fair standard of living for the agricultural community, in line with the EU Treaties’ objectives.  Such commitment is as relevant today as it was then, as the EU agricultural sector continues to face significant challenges. Uneven global playing fields, some import dependencies and vulnerability to geopolitical uncertainties add to the long-term uncertainty faced by EU farmers. At the same time, farmers must get a better revenue from the market, enabling them to make the necessary investments for future-proof and resilient farms. For this to materialise, current imbalances in the food chain where an unfair distribution of revenues, risks and the burden of costs often disproportionately affect primary producers, must be addressed.  These challenges justify public intervention for the sector and at the same time call for a robust and adaptive policy response to ensure a competitive, resilient, and sustainable agricultural sector. In line with the Commission Communication ‘A Vision for Agriculture and Food ’ 1 , such policy response would also contribute to ensure a more attractive and predictable sector where incomes enable farmers to thrive and attract future generations. In this context, defining proper enabling conditions at EU level together with an ambitious set of tools would help farmers to leverage their entrepreneurial potential, reinforce their position in the value chain, including incentives for farmers to share risks (e.g., via producer organisations or cooperatives). At the same time, by supporting investments in training, exchange of best practices, uptake of innovative production methods and proper risk management practices at farm level, farmers are thereby supported to explore different income sources and grasp new market opportunities, such as those linked to the growing bioeconomy applications of hemp.  This is why specific support for certain sectors is considered of strategic nature to contribute to achieving the CAP objectives and to reinforce synergies with other CAP instruments. Equally important is EU support for protein crops considering the agronomic challenges and climatic vulnerability limiting the interest by farmers to engage in this sector. At the same time, this particular attention is also determined by the need to reduce the Union dependence on imports for high-quality proteins, and reinforce, in line with the Vision, the EU open strategic autonomy.  In this context and as recalled by the Vision, sustainable livestock remains an essential part of the Union’s agriculture, competitiveness and cohesion. The Union livestock sector is particularly vulnerable to various shocks and global competition, and it is required to meet high production standards that are not always rewarded by the market. Recognising the natural composition of meat and meat products, in the interest of both Union producers and consumers becomes important as meat-related terms often carry cultural significance.  In line with t he Niinistö Report on the Preparedness and Readiness of the EU 2 and in the Preparedness Union Strategy 3 , preparedness considerations should be integrated into all Union policies. This new reality has been marked by significant shocks, from the pandemic, the Russian war of aggression and market disturbances to animal and plant diseases and a volatile geopolitical situation. This is why, to ensure the delivery of EU Treaty objectives when it comes to ensuring the availability of supply, also in time of emergencies and severe crises , preparedness in the agricultural sector across Member States should be enhanced. This should be achieved by complementing national initiatives, enhancing coordination among Member States and between Member States and the Commission and improving efficiency and fostering a culture of preparedness and resilience, while fully respecting national competences and the specific circumstances of each Member State as well as the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. In particular, the Commission Communication ‘ Union Stockpiling Strategy : Boosting the EU’s material preparedness for crisis’ 4 stresses that in severe, long-term, complex, and cross-border crises, it is crucial to coordinate national measures to ensure a steady supply of essential goods and the continuation of vital societal functions .  At the same time, in line with the Vision for Agriculture and Food, reconnecting EU consumers - especially vulnerable groups such as children - with food and local territories remains essential for the future of farming in Europe. For this reason, efforts to promote the quality of EU food on European markets, including in the outermost regions, as well as on the international markets should continue. Such initiatives would enhance both the competitiveness of the agricultural sector as well as encourage healthier eating habits among the general public. In this respect, the aid for the supply of fruit and vegetables and of milk and milk products in educational establishments (‘EU school scheme’) has proven to be effective in increasing the consumption of selected agricultural products, but its effectiveness and coherence with other CAP instruments should be further strengthened.  Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council 5 sets forth the fundamental rules for the common organisation of the markets in agricultural products (CMO). For the period 2028 to 2034, financial support for measures laid down in that Regulation will be governed by the legal framework set out in Regulation (EU) …/ … of the European Parliament and of the Council [NRPF] 6 . This support will also be subject to the rules specified in Regulation (EU) .../ … of the European Parliament and of the Council [Performance Regulation] 7 , which establishes a budget expenditure tracking and performance framework along with other horizontal rules for Union program mes and activities, unless otherwise specified.  Similarly, the EU school scheme and support for specific agricultural sectors will receive financial backing through National and Regional Partnership Plans (the ‘NRP Plans’) under Regulation (EU) …./… [NRPF Regulation]. However, since these are connected to agricultural product markets, the specific rules on the type of interventions should be laid down in Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013.  In addition, in order to take into account developments in the agricultural sector and to improve the implementation of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013, certain provisions of that Regulation need to be amended and updated.  Moreover, following the repeal of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council 8 and in view of the proposals for Regulations (EU) .../... [NRPF Regulation] and (EU) .../... [Performance Regulation] , certain empowerments laid down in Regulat ion (EU) No 1306/2013 and in Regulation (EU) 2021/2116 of the European Parliament and of the Council 9 concerning public intervention , aid for private storage, tariff rate quotas , producer organisations and securities should be integrated into Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013. Furthermore, following the integration of certain provisions of Regulation (EU) No 228/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council 10 into Regulation (EU) …./ … [NRPF Regulation], some of its provisions should also be integrate d into Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 .  To align with the provisions of the WTO Agreement on Agriculture it is necessary to update certain provisions for calculation of additional import duties.  As a part of this initiative, provisions on the conditions for production and marketing of hemp products should be laid down. The existing rules on imports of hemp should also be updated for consistency.  Finally, provisions on the availability of supplies of agricultural products in time of emergencies and severe crises should be provided for in Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  This proposal is fully consistent with the CAP Treaty objectives laid out in Article 39 TFEU. The objectives of the amendments are consistent with rules on the common market organisation for agricultural products . They aim at improving the existent common market organisation.  • Consistency with other E U policies  The amendments are consistent with other EU policies and reinforce the role of the CMO rules and related instruments in contributing to the objectives of the common agricultural policy .  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  Articles 42, 43(2) and 349 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) are the basis for the proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013.  The legal basis provides for: the establishment of the common organisation of agricultural markets and other provisions that are necessary for the pursuit of the objectives of the common agricultural policy, and rules on specific measures in outermost regions.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  Under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, agriculture is a field of shared competence between the Union and the Member States, and the principle of subsidiarity therefore applies.  Given the EU-wide dimension of the common market organisation and the fact that it regulates the free movement of goods of agricultural products in the internal market, the different issues need to be addressed at EU level than at the level of the Member States acting individually. Moreover, the proposed changes are amendments of the existing common market organisation for agricultural products.  • Proportionality  The proposal comprises limited and targeted changes to the current legislation, which are necessary for the good functioning of the existent common market organisation.  • Choice of the instrument  Given the objectives and content of the proposal, an amendment to the existing regulations is the most appropriate instrument.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  The proposal is part of the review of the CAP for post-2027 for which an overall impact assessment and stakeholder consultations have been carried out.  • Fundamental rights  The proposed amendments respect the rights and observe the principles enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, as laid down in Regulations (EU) .../... [NRPF Regulation]. The provisions of Regulations (EU) .../... [NRPF Regulation] concerning the respect of fundamental rights and the rule of law will apply also to the EU school scheme and the support for agricultural sectors.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  The EU school scheme and the support for agricultural sectors will be supported by the Fund for which rules are laid down in Regulations (EU) .../... [NRPF Regulation] and (EU) .../... [Performance Regulation]. As regards the EU school scheme, Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2023/106 fixes the indicative allocations of Union aid to Member States for school fruit and vegetables and for school milk for the period from 1 August 2023 to 31 July 2029, thus it encroaches on the next multiannual financial framework (‘MFF’) period, for the years 2028 to 2034. As with the CAP post-2027 a new school scheme will be set up from 2028, a specific reduced allocation must be defined for the 5-month period, from 1 August to 31 December 2027, for school year 2027/2028, as its implementation and financing will still fall under the current MFF.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  This initiative will be monitored through the performance framework applicable for the 2028- 2034 multiannual financial framework which is set out in the proposal for a Regulation (EU) .../… [Performance Regulation], which establishes a budget expenditure tracking and performance framework along with other horizontal rules for Union programmes and activities, unless otherwise specified.  EU school scheme interventions  The legal provisions provide the basic policy parameters, such as the objectives of the scheme and its basic requirements, while Member States would bear greater responsibility as to how they meet the objectives and achieve targets. Enhanced subsidiarity makes it possible to better take into account local conditions and needs. Regulation (EU) .../... [NRPF Regulation] rules should apply to the EU school scheme while specific rules on that type of intervention should be laid down in Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013.  In order to reduce the intake of free sugars and fats by schoolchildren, the distribution of products high in free sugars and fats should be limited. In order to raise awareness of children of the variety of products that are cultivated in the Union as well as their different qualities, the distribution of products originating in the Union should be prioritised combined with criteria linked to higher environmental and social sustainability standards . Member States should ensure the implementation of awareness raising measures on certain topics. As the case may be and to avoid duplications, the national curriculum can be used instead of the scheme. In view of the increased concern over processed foods and products potentially high in added sugars, which do not meet children’s nutritional needs, those products should be excluded from the EU school scheme. Those new elements emerge from the evaluation of the scheme, as thoroughly analysed in the impact assessment.  Sectoral interventions  The legal provisions define minimum requirements concerning the contents and policy objectives for such types of intervention which have the overall aim to ensure the efficient functioning and stability of agricultural markets. This would ensure a level playing field in the internal market and lay down conditions of equal and fair competition. When including interventions in certain sectors in their NRP Plans, Member States should ensure consistency with other interventions at a sectoral level. The types of intervention in certain sectors should provide support to the fruit and vegetables, wine, protein crops, apiculture products, olive oil and table olives and hops sectors, as well as for other sectors and products listed in Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 and, for which the establishment of specific interventions is deemed to have beneficial effects on the achievement of some or all of the general and specific objectives of the CAP pursued by Regulation (EU) .../... [NRPF Regulation].  Protein crops  The legal provisions introduce specific rules for the mandatory recognition of producers and interbranch organisations in this sector. This would help to strengthen the value chain at regional, national and transnational level, and address agronomic challenges jeopardising farmers’ interest in this sector.  In order to support the production of protein crops and reduce the Union dependence on imports for high-quality proteins, a distinct protein crop sector should be created in Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013. For that purpose, the protein crop sector will replace the current dried fodder sector. Products belonging to the protein crop sector will be moved from Part XXIV of Annex I to a new Section 1 in Part IV of Annex I, to Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013. Dried fodders which are not protein crops will be moved from the current Part IV of Annex I to Part XXIV of that Annex. The reference to the dried fodder sector should be removed from Article 6 on marketing years.  Transitional provisions should be added in Articles 154 and 158 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 for the recognition of existing producer organisations (POs) and interbranch organisations (IBOs) already recognised for products that fall under the new protein crop sector.  The protein crop sector should be added to the list of sectors for which Member States are obliged to recognise, on request, producer organisations and interbranch organisations (Article 159, points (a) and (b), respectively of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013).  Marketing standards  In line with the conclusions of the Commission report on new marketing standards for dried leguminous vegetables and soya bean 11 , it is appropriate to provide for the possibility to lay down marketing standards for protein crop s to better inform consumers about the origin of the protein crops products they purchase. For the same reason, beef, pigmeat, sheep and goat me a t should be added to the list for which marketing standards can be adopted. In addition, with the objective of possibly harmonising the definition and composition of certain cheeses to ensure a common basis for quality across the internal market, it is also appropriate to provide for the possibility to lay down marketing standards for cheese.  Hemp  Hemp falls under the CMO of the CAP, with Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 expanding its scope beyond fibre use. Farmers can receive area-based CAP payments if they meet standard and hemp-specific criteria, including growing varieties with Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (‘THC’) content below 0,3 % to prevent illicit crop cultivation.  The European Court of Justice 12 ruled that cannabidiol ( ‘ CBD ’ ) from the whole Cannabis Sativa plant is not a drug under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. However, inconsistencies among Member States' regulations limit full plant utili s ation and economic potential, especially concerning flowering tops. These discrepancies can hinder farmers from accessing CAP support or marketing hemp products across Member States.  To address this, Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 will include rules on hemp production and marketing. Article 189 will be amended, and Annex I, Part VIII will be expanded to encompass all hemp plant parts as agricultural products, provided CAP requirements are met. This aims to align with the EU hemp market's growth, offering legal certainty to farmers.  New legal provisions will also uphold public health protection, keeping strict seed certification and a 0,3 % THC limit, ensuring compliance with international drug conventions. Scientific evidence supports low health risk from hemp varieties with up to 0,3 % THC. To harmonise Annex I, Part VIII, changes will also apply to linseed, moving relevant products from Annex I, Part XXIV, Section 1.  Transitional provisions will protect existing producer organisations and allow farmers to market hemp sown before new rules apply. With a deferred application, stakeholders will have time to adjust to the new regulatory framework.  Sugar  Article 125 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 requires that the terms for buying sugar beet and sugar cane are to be governed by written agreements within the trade, as described in Part II, Section A, point 6, of Annex II to that Regulation. Article 125(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 requires the agreements within the trade to conform to the purchase terms laid down in Annex X to that Regulation. Those provisions should be amended for the sake of clarity and consistency as regards the parties to the agreements within the trade and as regards the products concerned by those agreements and subject to purchase terms.  Furthermore, in order to enhance legal clarity and reinforce the protection of the rights of beet sellers in contractual relationships with sugar undertakings, it is necessary to amend point VIII of Annex X to Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 to explicitly provide that the ownership of the beet pulp remains with the beet seller unless otherwise agreed.  To give stakeholders from the sugar sector sufficient time to adapt, the application of the changes concerning the agreements within the trade should be deferred until 1 October after the year of entry into force of the Regulation.  Additional import duties  Article 182(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 lays down rules for the calculation method that may be used to fix the tigger volume for the purpose of the application of additional import duties. In order to correctly reflect the calculation method set out in Article 5(4) of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Agriculture, Article 182(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 should be amended to specify that the calculation should be based on the average yearly imports in the three preceding years. Furthermore, Article 182(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 provides that additional duties are not to be imposed where imports are unlikely to disturb the Union market, or where effects would be disproportionate to the intended objective. However, demonstrating that imports are likely to disturb the Union market is difficult and, in case of perishable seasonal products, where such safeguard currently applies, often unfeasible or not sufficiently timely. Since this requirement goes beyond obligations set out in the WTO Agreement on Agriculture, and in order to address stakeholders’ concerns and simplify the procedure, the referred paragraph 2 should be deleted.  Rules on the availability of supplies in time of emergencies and severe crisis  Legal provisions introduce obligations for Member States to adopt baseline preparedness measures that should include the establishment of national and/or regional preparedness and response plans concerning agricultural products, regular sharing of information on stocks of agricultural products, the designation of competent authorities and participation in EU-level stress testing exercises. These efforts should be complemented by enhanced obligations during crises or high-risk situations, including mandatory reporting.  The Union Stockpiling strategy aims to combine centralised reserves with contributions from Member States, supported by public-private partnerships to ensure efficiency, scalability and cost-effectiveness. Where Member States establish and manage reserves of agricultural products, rules should be introduced to ensure that such measures are designed in a manner that minimises market distortions.  Meat designations  Specific legal provisions should be introduced to protect meat-related terms in order to enhance transparency in the internal market as regards food composition and nutritional content and ensure that consumers can make well-informed choices, particularly for those seeking a specific nutritional content that is traditionally associated with meat products.  POSEI  In view of the proposals for Regulations (EU) .../... [NRPF Regulation] and (EU) .../... [Performance Regulation], provisions laid down in Regulation (EU) No 228/2013 concerning the use of a logo for the marketing of quality agricultural products in the outermost regions and the State aid derogation for national payments for the sugar sector in the French outermost regions should be integrated into Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013.  Reinsert missing rules and empowerments  Rules as well as empowerments relevant for measures provided for by Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 were laid down in Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 and are currently laid down in Regulation (EU) 2021/2116. Following the repeal of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 and in view of the proposals for Regulations (EU) .../... [NRPF Regulation] and (EU) .../... [Performance Regulation], rules and empowerments laid down in Regulation (EU) 2021/2116 concerning public intervention and aid for private storage, tariff quotas, recognition of producer organisations and securities should be integrated into Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013.  Deferred application and transitional rules  In order to allow Member States and operators sufficient time to comply with the new rules, the date of application should be postponed for amendments related to agreements within the trade for the sugar sector, conditions for the marketing, production and imports of hemp, and the provisions on the availability of supplies in time of emergencies and severe crisis. Furthermore, in order to ensure a smooth transition to the new EU school scheme, the deletion of the provisions relating to the EU school scheme laid down Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 should apply from 1 January 2028, but should continue to apply in respect of measures implemented until 31 December 2027. Moreover, as the current EU school scheme will be discontinued on 31 December 2028, a specific reduced allocation must be defined for the 5-month period, from 1 August to 31 December 2027, for school year 2027/2028, as its implementation and financing will still fall under the current MFF.  2025/0237 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 as regards the school fruit, vegetables and milk scheme (‘EU school scheme’), sectoral interventions, the creation of a protein sector, requirements for hemp, the possibility for marketing standards for cheese, protein crops and meat, application of additional import duties, rules on the availability of supplies in time of emergencies and severe crisis and securities  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 42, Article 43(2) and Article 349 thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 13 ,  Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions 14 ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) The Commission Communication of 19 February 2025 entitled ‘A V ision for Agriculture and Food’ 15 announces that the c ommon a gricultural p olicy (CAP) post-2027 will provide for further responsibility and accountability for Member States on how they meet the CAP objectives, supporting and stabilising farmers’ incomes and attracting a future generation of farmers, and guaranteeing food security. It should be a simpler and more targeted policy with more flexibility for farmers and a shift from requirements to incentives for farmers.  (2) The m ultiannual f inancial f ramework for the years 2028 to 2034 legislative package includes Regulation (EU) .../... of the European Parliament and of the Council [NRPF Regulation] 16 establishing the National and Regional Partnership Fund (the ‘Fund’) for the period 2028 to 2034, grouping the nationally pre-allocated funds under the Fund, including the European Agriculture Guarantee Fund (EAGF) and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD). In accordance with that Regulation t he Fund is to be implemented through National and Regional Partnership Plans (the ‘NRP Plans’) and the EU Facility (the ‘Facility’).  (3) Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council 17 provides for all basic elements of the common organisation of the markets in agricultural products.  (4) The CAP support provided for in Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 for the period post-2027 will be supported by the Fund and subject to the rules laid down in Regulation s (EU) .../... [NRPF Regulation] and (EU) .../... of the European Parliament and of the Council [Performance Regulation] 18 , as complemented by Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 .  (5) The production of protein crops in the Union faces persistent difficulties, due in particular to volatile supply and demand at local level and the agronomic challenges of their cultivation, which make them a higher-risk option for farmers. In order to support their production and reduce the Union dependence on imports for high-quality proteins, it is appropriate to create a distinct protein crop sector in Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013. Furthermore, in order to facilitate the setting up of producer and interbranch organisations in the protein crop sector, and thereby strengthen the value chain at regional, national and transitional level, its recognition should be made mandatory. As the main products of the dried fodder sector listed in Part IV of Annex I to that Regulation should be included in the protein sector, the dried fodder sector should be removed from Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 .  (6) By its judgment of 7 September 2016 in Case C-113/14 19 , the Court of Justice of the European Union (‘the Court’) annulled Article 7 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 determining the reference thresholds for agricultural products on the grounds that those thresholds should have been adopted by the Council only, on a proposal from the Commission, on the basis of Article 43(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). It is therefore appropriate to delete Article 7 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013.  (7) Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 lays down rules for public intervention. Regulation (EU) 2021/2116 laid down rules for public intervention expenditure and empowered the Commission to supplement that Regulation with rules on the type of measures eligible for Union financing and the reimbursement conditions, the eligibility conditions and calculation methods based on the information actually observed by the paying agencies, on flat rates determined by the Commission, or on flat-rate or non-flat-rate amounts provided for by the agricultural legislation in specific sectors, the valuation of operations in connection with public intervention, the measures to be taken in the case of loss or deterioration of products under the public intervention, and the determination of the amounts to be financed. Since these rules are necessary for the functioning of the system of public intervention, the existing empowerments should be integrated in Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 .  (8) In addition to the rules on public intervention, Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 lays down rules on aid for private storage. Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1238 20 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/1240 21 lay down rules on checks and penalties adopted pursuant to empowerments for delegated and implementing acts laid down in Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council 22 . Following the repeal of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 and in view of Regulations (EU) .../... [NRPF Regulation] and (EU) .../... [Performance Regulation], the empowerments laid down in Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 and in Regulation (EU) 2021 /2116 of the European Parliament and of the Council 23 to adopt delegated and implementing acts concerning checks and penalties related to public intervention and aid for private storage should be integrated into Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013.  (9) In particular, the Commission should be empowered to adopt delegated acts to supplement Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 with rules on reduction of payment of aid in case operators do not comply with their obligations relating to the conditions for public intervention or for private storage. The Commission should also be empowered to adopt, by way of implementing acts, uniform rules for Member States for the tests and methods to be applied in order to establish the eligibility of products for public intervention and private storage and the use of tendering procedures for public interventions or for private storage, on administrative and on-the-spot checks to be conducted by Member States with regard to the respect of obligations, commitments and eligibility criteria for public intervention or for private storage as well as on the application and calculation of administrative penalties by Member States when operators do not comply with the eligibility criteria, commitments or other obligations relating to the conditions for public intervention or for private storage.  (10) The aid for the supply of fruit and vegetables and of milk and milk products in educational establishments laid down in Part II , Title I, Chapter II, of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 (‘EU school scheme’) has proven to be effective in increasing the consumption of selected agricultural products. In order to contribute to achieving the CAP objectives, the EU s chool s cheme should be continued. However, in order to increase its effectiveness and to ensure coherence with other CAP instruments, the EU s chool s cheme should be based on delivery of performance and should be implemented as a type of intervention supported by the Fund . The Union should set the basic policy parameters, such as the objectives of the EU school scheme and its basic requirements, while Member States should bear greater responsibility as to how they meet the objectives and achieve targets. Enhanced subsidiarity makes it possible to better take into account local conditions and needs. Rules laid down in Regulation s (EU) .../... [NRPF Regulation] and (EU) …/… [Performance Regulation] should apply to the EU s chool s cheme , as complemented by this Regulation . T he EU s chool s cheme being a market intervention measure, the specific rules on the type of intervention should be laid down in Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013.  (11) The objective of the EU school scheme is to reconnect children with agriculture and increase healthy eating habits. As children from vulnerable groups are more prone to have unhealthy diets, Member States should be given the possibility to focus on these groups according to socio-economic considerations. In order to reduce the intake of free sugars and fats by schoolchildren, the distribution of products high in free sugars and fats should be limited. In order to raise awareness of children of the variety of products that are cultivated in the Union as well as their different qualities, the distribution of products originating in the Union should be prioritised combined with criteria linked to higher environmental and social sustainability standards. Member States sh ould ensure the implementation of awareness raising measures on certain topics. T o avoid duplicates, the national curriculum can be used instead of the EU school scheme. In view of the increased concern over processed foods and products potentially high in added sugars, which do not meet children’s nutritional needs, it is appropriate to exclude those products from the EU school scheme.  (12) Considering that the EU school scheme implemented under the Fund is to cover the period from 1 January 2028 to 31 December 2034, the deletion of the provisions relating to the EU s chool s cheme laid down in Part II, Title I, Chapter II, of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 should apply from 1 January 2028 . In order to ensure a smooth transition, it should be provided that the deleted provisions continue to apply in respect of measures implemented until 31 December 2027. Furthermore, considering that the EU school scheme laid down in Part II, Title I, Chapter II, of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 will therefore be discontinued before the end of school year 2027/2028 , which runs from 1 August 2027 until 31 July 2028, the overall limit of Union aid laid down per school year in Article 23a of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013, should be proportionally reduced for that school year .  (13) Types of intervention in certain sectors are needed to contribute to achieving the CAP objectives and reinforce synergies with other CAP instruments. Minimum requirements concerning the contents and objectives for such types of intervention should be established at Union level in order to ensure a level playing field in the internal market and avoid conditions of unequal and unfair competition. When including interventions in certain sectors in their NRP Plans, Member States should ensure consistency with other interventions at sector level. The types of intervention in certain sectors should provide support to the fruit and vegetables, wine, protein crops, apiculture products, olive oil and table olives and hops sectors, as well as for other sectors and products listed in Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013. In particular, given the Union’s deficit on plant protein and the environmental benefits their production brings, legumes should be included among the products eligible for support while respecting the EU WTO schedule on oilseeds.  (14) In order to protect the financial interests of the Union’s budget , and ensure that penalties are proportionate, effective and dissuasive, the Commission should be empowered to adopt delegated acts to supplement Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 with rules on the suspension, reduction and recovery for payments of aid for sectoral interventions in case of non-respect of the recognition criteria by the producer organisations. In addition, the Commission should be empowered to adopt, by way of implementing acts, rules on administrative and on-the-spot checks to be conducted by Member States on producer organisations or associations of producer organisations to verify compliance with the recognition criteria, as well as rules on a unique identification system of recognised producer organisations and associations of producer organisations.  (15) In line with the conclusions of the Commission report on new marketing standards for dried leguminous vegetables and soya bean 24 , i t is appropriate to provide for the possibility to lay down marketing standards for protein crops to better inform consumers about the origin of the protein crops products they purchase. For the same reason, beef, pigmeat, sheep and goat meet should be added to the list for which marketing standards may be adopted. In addition, with the objective of possibly harmonising the definition and composition of certain cheese s to ensure a common basis for quality across the internal market, it is also appropriate to provide for the possibility to lay down marketing standards for cheese.  (16) The Commission Communication ‘A Vision for Agriculture and Food’ recalls livestock is an essential part of the Union’s agriculture, competitiveness and cohesion. Sustainable livestock systems are essential for the Union economy, the viability of rural areas and the preservation of the environment and rural landscapes. The Union livestock sector is particularly vulnerable to various shocks and global competition and it is required to meet high production standards that are not always rewarded by the market. In this context, it is necessary to acknowledge the natural composition of meat and meat products, in the interest of both Union producers and consumers. Meat-related terms often carry cultural and historical significance. It is therefore appropriate to protect meat-related terms to enhance transparency in the internal market as regards the food composition and nutritional content and ensure that consumers can make well-informed choices, particularly for those seeking a specific nutritional content that is traditionally associated with meat products.  (17) Regulation (EU) No 228/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council 25 introduced a logo to encourage farmers in the outermost regions to continue to supply high-quality products and to promote their marketing. In view of Regulations (EU) .../... [NRPF Regulation] and (EU) .../... [Performance Regulation], provisions laid down in Regulation (EU) No 228/2013 concerning the use of the logo should be integrated into Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 and apply from 1 January 2028 .  (18) Article 125(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 requires that the terms for buying sugar beet and sugar cane are to be governed by written agreements within the trade, as described in Part II , Section A, point 6, of Annex II to that Regulation. Article 125(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 requires the agreements within the trade to conform to the purchase terms laid down in Annex X to that Regulation. For the sake of clarity, Article 125, Part II , Section A, points 5 and 6, of Annex II, and Annex X to Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 should be amended to ensure consistency between those provisions as regards the parties to the agreements within the trade and as regards the products concerned by those agreements and subject to purchase terms. In particular, it should be clarified that the rules on sugar agreements and purchase terms apply not only to sugar beet but also to sugar cane.  (19) Innovation and the growth of the bioeconomy have led to new applications for hemp biomass derived from all parts of the plant. This provides farmers with additional opportunities to valorise the plant beyond fibre production, making hemp a more attractive and competitive crop. In addition, growing hemp has environmental and climate benefits as it does not require pesticides or fertilisers and improves soil structure . Several hemp products, including raw hemp (CN 5302), hemp seeds (CN 1207 99 91) and other hemp parts (CN 1211 90 86) are listed as agricultural products in Annex I to the T FEU . In the interest of clarity, the products covered by the flax and hemp sector listed in Annex I, Part VIII, to Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 should be amended to include hemp products other than raw hemp.  (20) Some Member States have adopted national measures, on grounds of health protection, that prohibit the production or marketing of specific hemp products. These divergent national approaches undermine the proper functioning of the common market organisation, create legal uncertainty and barriers in the internal market and cause unfair competition between farmers in different Member States .  (21) In compliance with various international instruments which the Member States have cooperated on or acceded to, as the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 and the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971, the marketing of narcotic drugs should be prohibited , w ith the exception of strictly controlled trade or use for medical and scientific purposes. However, it follows from the reasoning of the Court in Case C - 663/18 26 that non-psychoactive products as cannabidiol derived from hemp varieties with a low Δ9- tetrahydrocannabinol content are not to be considered narcotic drugs under these conventions.  (22) Scientific evidence also suggests that hemp products obtained from varieties containing a maximum tetrahydrocannabinol content of 0.3 % are unlikely to pose a risk to human health. Therefore, to ensure legal certainty, promote the development of the sector, guarantee a level playing field across the Union and support the proper functioning of the common market organisation, while protecting public health interests, it is necessary to lay down harmonised rules at Union level for the production and marketing of hemp agricultural products that provide public health safeguards. In particular, these rules should include a uniform maximum limit of tetrahydrocannabinol content, as well as other appropriate safeguards.  (23) Furthermore, i t is also appropriate to amend Article 189 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 that lays down rules on the imports of hemp in order to ensure consistency with the new Union rules on the marketing of hemp products.  (24) In order to ensure legal certainty and to avoid disproportionate disruption for farmers , transitional arrangements should be put in place for the placing on the market of hemp products derived from hemp plants sown before the date of application of the new marketing conditions. Those products should be allowed to continue to be marketed subject to the rules in force prior to that date and only until [31 December of the year after the entry into force of th is amending Regulation]. After that date, all hemp products should comply with the new marketing conditions .  (25) In order to ensure a smooth transition following the creation of the protein crop sector, and to provide legal certainty and continuity for recognised producer or interbranch organisations, it is appropriate to provide that producer or interbranch organisations already recognised before [date of entry into force of this amending Regulation] for products that fall under the new protein crop sector should be deemed to be recognised in that sector. Such producer organisations should also retain their recognition for other products listed under other sectors. However, in cases where they no longer meet the relevant conditions for recognition in one or more sectors, Member States should withdraw the corresponding recognition no later than [31 December 20XX at least 2 full years after the date of entry into force of this amending Regulation].  (26) In order to ensure a smooth transition following the amendment of the products listed in the flax and hemp sector in Point VIII of Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013, and to provide legal certainty and continuity for recognised producer or interbranch organisations, it is appropriate to provide that producer or interbranch organisations already recognised before [date of entry into force of this amending Regulation] for products that fall under the amended flax and hemp sector should be deemed to be recognised in that sector. Such producer organisations should also retain their recognition for other products listed under other sectors. However, in cases where they no longer meet the relevant conditions for recognition in one or more sectors, Member States should withdraw the corresponding recognition no later than [31 December 20XX at least 2 full years after the date of entry into force of this amending Regulation].  (27) Article 182(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 lays down rules for the calculation method that may be used to fix the tigger volume for the purpose of the application of additional import duties. In order to correctly reflect the calculation method set out in Article 5(4) of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Agriculture, Article 182(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 should be amended to specify that the calculation should be based on the average yearly imports in the three preceding years. Furthermore, Article 182(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 provides that additional duties are not to be imposed where the imports are unlikely to disturb the Union market, or where the effects would be disproportionate to the intended objective. However, demonstrating that imports are likely to disturb the Union market is difficult and, in case of perishable seasonal products, where such safeguard currently applies, often unfeasible or not sufficiently timely. Since this requirement goes beyond the obligations set out in the WTO Agreement on Agriculture, and in order to address the stakeholders’ concerns and simplify the procedure, that paragraph 2 should be deleted.  (28) Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 lays down rules on the management of tariff quotas. Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/760 27 lays down rules on penalties for operators for cases of non-compliance with the conditions and eligibility requirements that an operator has to fulfil to submit an application within the tariff quota, that were adopted pursuant to an empowerment for the adoption of delegated acts laid down in Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013. Following the repeal of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013, the empowerment to adopt delegated acts in this respect should be integrated in Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013.  (29) Article 214a of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 allows Finland to grant, under certain conditions, national aid in Southern Finland until 2027, subject to the authorisation of the Commission. In view of the specificities of Finnish agriculture, the granting of that national aid should continue to be allowed for the period 2028 to 2034.  (30) Regulation (EU) No 228/2013 granted a state aid derogation for national payments for the sugar sector in the French outermost regions in order to mitigate the specific constraints on sugar farming in those regions linked to their extreme remoteness, specifically their isolation, insularity, small surface areas, mountainous terrain and climate and their economic dependency on sugar production. In view of Regulations (EU) .../... [NRPF Regulation] and (EU) .../... [Performance Regulation], provisions laid down in Regulation (EU) 228/2013 granting that derogation should be integrated into Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 and apply from 1 January 2028 .  (31) As underlined in the Joint Communication on the European Preparedness Union Strategy 28 , the Union should strengthen its preparedness in response to growing risks and deep uncertainty, with the objective of establishing a secure and resilient Union equipped with the capacities to anticipate, respond to and manage threats and hazards, regardless of their nature or origin. Preparedness considerations should be integrated into all Union policies. The Commission Communication ‘ EU stockpiling strategy: Boosting the EU's material preparedness for crises ’ 29 stressed that in severe, long-term, complex, and cross-border crises, it is crucial to coordinate national measures to ensure a steady supply of essential goods and the continuation of vital societal functions.  (32) To ensure the availability of supply, set out as one of the objectives of the CAP in the TFEU, also in time of emergencies and severe crises, preparedness in the agricultural sector should be enhanced. This should be achieved by complementing national initiatives, enhancing coordination among Member States and between Member States and the Commission and improving efficiency and fostering a culture of preparedness and resilience, while fully respecting the national competences and the specific circumstances of each Member State and the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.  (33) Member States should therefore be required to adopt baseline preparedness measures that should include the establishment of national and/or regional preparedness and response plans concerning agricultural products, regular sharing of information on stocks of agricultural products, the designation of competent authorities and participation in Union -level stress testing exercises. Where Member States establish and manage reserves of agricultural products, they should be implemented as part of their national and/or regional preparedness and response plans and should be designed in a manner that minimises market distortions. Those preparedness efforts should be complemented by enhanced obligations during crises or high-risk situations, including mandatory reporting.  (34) In order to ensure the uniform conditions for the implementation of the provisions concerning the availability of supplies in time of emergencies and severe crises, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission as regards reporting requirements concerning the food security preparedness and response plans, cross-border cooperation in the framework of development and application of the food security preparedness and response plans , coordinated actions for the establishment and management of reserves, such as the identification of categories of products for the establishment of the reserves and the development of joint risk assessments and early warning mechanisms to mitigate cross-border supply risks and ensure continuity of supply during disruptions, voluntary solidarity and mutual assistance mechanisms by which Member States make parts of their reserves available to another Member State facing severe shortages, real-time reporting on stocks and other relevant information as well as technical and procedural requirements for the secure handling and exchange of information. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council 30 .  (35) Various provisions of agricultural legislation require that security be lodged to ensure the payment of a sum due if an obligation is not met. This is in particular the case for the management of tariff quota s and of public intervention and private storage. In view of Regulations (EU) .../... [NRPF Regulation] and (EU) .../... [Performance Regulation], provisions laid down in Regulation (EU) 2021/2116 concerning securities should be integrated in to Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013. The empowerments to adopt delegated and implementing acts concerning securities should also be maintained and therefore integrated into Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013.  (36) In particular, in order to ensure non-discriminatory treatment, equity and the respect of proportionality when lodging a security, that delegation of power should cover rules on securities specifying the responsible party in the event that an obligation is not met, laying down the specific situations in which the competent authority may waive the requirement of a security, the conditions applicable to the security to be lodged and the guarantor, the conditions for lodging and releasing that security, the specific conditions related to the security lodged in connection with advance payments, and setting out the consequences of breaching the obligations for which a security has been lodged. Furthermore, the implementing powers of the Commission should cover the form of the securities to be lodged and the procedure for lodging the securities, for accepting them, and for replacing the original securities; the procedures for the release of securities; and the notification to be made by Member States or by the Commission in the context of securities.  (37) Regulation (EU) .../... [NRPF Regulation] provides that as regards expenditure for public intervention, the Commission has in certain cases to fix the uniform standard amounts for material operations arising from storage and, where appropriate, for the processing of the products eligible for public intervention referred in Article 11 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/201 3 . The relevant implementing acts are to be adopted in accordance with the advisory procedure laid down in Regulation (EU) No 182/2011. For the adoption of these implementing acts the Commission should be assisted by the Committee for the Common Organisation of the Agricultural markets established by Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013. Since that Regulation does not contain any reference to the advisory procedure of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011, a reference to th at procedure should be inserted in Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013.  (38) Section B, point IV, of Annex IV to Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 lays down that the grading methods to assess the lean-meat content for the purposes of the Union scale for the classification of pig carcasses are to be authorised by the Commission. Considering that the pig grading methods to assess the lean-meat content are authorised per Member State, f or the sake of simplicity and reduction of administrative burden, the grading methods should be authorised by Member States instead of the Commission.  (39) Point VIII of Annex X to Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 provides that delivery contracts between beet sellers and sugar undertaking are to set out the arrangements for the return or compensation of beet pulp. In order to ensure greater legal clarity and reinforce the protection of the rights of beet sellers, it is appropriate to amend Annex X to that Regulation to explicitly provide that the beet pulp obtained from the beet delivered remains the property of the beet seller unless otherwise agreed. To ensure transparency and balanced contractual relations, delivery contracts should explicitly stipulate the arrangements for the return, retention or processing of the pulp, including, where applicable, the quantities concerned, the sharing of pressing or drying costs, and the price or calculation method for any compensation due.  (40) Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 should therefore be amended accordingly.  (41) In order to give stakeholders sufficient time to adapt to the changes, the amendments related to agreements within the trade for the sugar sector should apply from [1 October of the year after the date of entry into force of this Regulation].  (42) In order to give stakeholders sufficient time to adapt, the rules on the conditions for the marketing , production and imports of hemp should apply from [1 January after the date of entry into force of this Regulation ] and the rules on meat-related terms should apply from [12 months after the date of entry into force of this Regulation] .  (43) In order to give Member States time to start implementing the provisions on the availability of supplies in time of emergencies and severe crises, these provisions should apply from [12 months after the date of entry into force of this Regulation] ,  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Article 1  Amendments to Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013  Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 is amended as follows:  (1) in Article 1 (2) , point (d) is replaced by the following:  ‘(d) protein crop sector, Part IV’;  (2) Article 2 is replaced by the following:  ‘Article 2  General common agricultural policy (CAP) provisions  Regulation (EU) .../... of the European Parliament and of the Council [NRPF Regulation]* and Regulation (EU) …/… of the European Parliament and of the Council [Performance Regulation]** and the provisions adopted pursuant to them shall apply in relation to the measures laid down in this Regulation.  ___________  * Regulation (EU) .../... of the European Parliament and of the Council [NRPF Regulation] (OJ L …, ELI: ).  ** Regulation (EU) .../... of the European Parliament and of the Council [Performance Regulation] (OJ L …, ELI: ).’;  (3) Article 3 is amended as follows:  (a) paragraph 3 is deleted ;  (b) in paragraph 5, the following point is added:  ‘(c) “outermost regions” means the regions referred to in Article 349 TFEU.’;  (4) in Article 6, point (b) is replaced by the following:  ‘(b) 1 April to 31 March of the following year for the silkworm sector;’;  (5) Article 7 is deleted;  (6) the references to ‘Article 229(2) or (3)’ in Articles 13(1)(c), 13(2), 21, second subparagraph, 116, 149(6), second subparagraph, 152(1c), second subparagraph, 175, second subparagraph, 179, second subparagraph, 183, second subparagraph, 193a(2), 213 and 216(2), should be replaced by ‘Article 229(2), (3) or (4)’;  (7) in Part II, Title I, Chapter I, Section 2, the following Article is added:  ‘Article 16a  Public intervention expenditure  The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 227 supplementing this Regulation with rules on:  (a) the type of measures eligible for Union financing and the reimbursement conditions;  (b) the eligibility conditions and calculation methods based on the information actually observed by the paying agencies, on flat rates determined by the Commission, or on flat-rate or non-flat-rate amounts provided for by the agricultural legislation in specific sectors;  (c) the valuation of operations in connection with public intervention, the measures to be taken in the case of loss or deterioration of products under the public intervention, and the determination of the amounts to be financed. ’;  (8) in Article 19(5), the following point is added:  ‘(d) laying down the rules on payment of aid and identifying cases where no aid is paid or the aid is reduced in case operators do not comply with their obligations relating to the conditions for public intervention or for private storage as referred to in Sections 2 and 3.’;  (9) i n Article 20, first subparagraph, the following points are added :  ‘(v) rules necessary for the tests and methods to be applied in order to establish the eligibility of products for public intervention and private storage and the use of tendering procedures for public interventions or for private storage;  (w) rules on administrative and on-the-spot checks to be conducted by Member States with regard to the respect of obligations, commitments and eligibility criteria for public intervention or for private storage as referred to in Sections 2 and 3;  (x) detailed rules for the application and calculation of administrative penalties by Member States when operators do not comply with the eligibility criteria, commitments or other obligations relating to the conditions for public intervention or for private storage as referred to in Sections 2 and 3.’;  (10) in Part II, Title I, Chapter II is deleted ;  (11) in Article 23a , the following paragraph is inserted:  ‘1a.

Article 32  Beneficiaries  1. Member States shall establish in their NRP Plans which operators may benefit from interventions in the sectors referred to in Article 30(1).  2. In their NRP Plans, Member States shall establish that producer organisations and association of producer organisations recognised under this Regulation and producer groups as referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article are the sole beneficiaries of the interventions referred to in Article 30(2).  3. Member States may decide that producer groups and entities representing other form of cooperation between producers that are constituted at the initiative of producers and controlled by them, may be beneficiaries of the interventions in the sectors referred to in Article 30(1). Such forms of cooperation shall be identified by the competent authority of a Member State as producer groups for the duration of their first operational programme. An operational programme and a recognition plan with a view to be recognised as producer organisations in accordance with the requirements laid down in Articles 152, 153, 154, 156 or 161 prepared by those producer groups shall be submitted to the competent authorities simultaneously.

Article 34  Value of marketed production  1. Member States shall indicate in their NRP Plans how the value of marketed production is calculated for each sector.  2. The value of the marketed production for a producer organisation, association of producer organisations or producer group shall be calculated on the basis of the production of the producer organisation or producer group or association of producer organisations and its producer members that has been put on the market by this organisation, association or producer group and shall only include the production of those products for which the producer organisation, association or producer group is recognised or identified.  In addition, the value of marketed production shall be calculated at fresh stage or at the first processing stage on which the product is normally marketed, in bulk, where products are allowed to be marketed in bulk. It shall be further calculated at the ‘ex-organisation, association or producer group’ stage or at ‘ex-subsidiary’ stage, provided that at least 90 % of the shares or capital of the subsidiary is owned by the producer organisation, association or producer group.  The value of marketed production shall include the value of the by-products, of market withdrawals for free distribution, of outsourced activities or of the insurance indemnification received in respect of harvest and production insurance actions.  Cost of processing in case of processed products, VAT and costs of transport internal to the organisation or producer group for distance exceeding 300 km shall not be included in the calculation of the value of marketed production.  Doubled counting of the values of marketed production shall be prohibited. In order to avoid double counting of values of marketed production, the production of the members of a producer organisation, association of producer organisations or producer group which is marketed by another such organisation shall only be counted in the value of the marketed production of the latter organisation.  3. Member States shall determine a 12-month calendar reference period during the three years prior to the year for which the aid is requested.  Where historical data on marketed production for newly recognised producer organisations, association or producer group is insufficient for the purposes of the first subparagraph, Member States shall accept the value of marketed production communicated by the producer organisation, association or group for the purpose of its recognition.  4. Where for a product a reduction of at least 35 % in the value of marketed production for a given year in relation to the average of the three previous 12-month reference periods has occurred due to natural disasters, climatic events, plant diseases or pest infestations or any other reasons falling outside the responsibility and control of the organisation, association or group, the value of marketed production of that product shall be deemed to represent 85 % of the average value in the three previous 12-month reference periods. If preventive measures were undertaken, the value of marketed production of that product shall be deemed to represent 100 % of the average value in the three previous 12-month reference periods.

These changes are designed to enhance the strategic role of farming and food production, ensuring food security for 450 million Europeans, supporting rural economies, and promoting environmental sustainability. The proposal addresses challenges such as global competition, import dependencies, and geopolitical uncertainties that impact EU farmers.

Key elements of the proposal include enhancing the EU school scheme for fruit, vegetables, and milk, and introducing sectoral interventions to support specific agricultural sectors like protein crops and hemp. A new protein crop sector is proposed to reduce reliance on imports and promote sustainable livestock farming, crucial for the EU's agricultural competitiveness and cohesion. The proposal also emphasizes preparedness in the agricultural sector to ensure supply availability during emergencies and crises, advocating for better coordination among EU Member States and the Commission.

To address supply chain vulnerabilities, the proposal introduces legal provisions requiring Member States to adopt baseline preparedness measures, including the establishment of national and/or regional preparedness and response plans for agricultural products. This includes regular sharing of information on stocks, designation of competent authorities, and participation in EU-level stress testing exercises. Enhanced obligations during crises or high-risk situations, such as mandatory reporting, are also proposed. The Union Stockpiling strategy aims to combine centralized reserves with contributions from Member States, supported by public-private partnerships to ensure efficiency, scalability, and cost-effectiveness.

CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  Regulation (EU) No 472/2013, adopted on 21 May 2013, establishes a comprehensive policy framework for addressing situations where Member States in the euro area (a) experience or are threatened with serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability, leading to potential spill-over effects on other Member States in the euro area, or (b) request or receive financial assistance. Specifically, Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 principally concerns three regimes. Firstly, that Regulation empowers the Commission to subject a euro area Member State to enhanced surveillance in case of threats to a Member State’s financial stability which are likely to have adverse spill-over effects on other euro area Member States, or when a euro area Member State is in receipt of precautionary financial assistance. Under this surveillance, the concerned Member State’s fiscal situation is monitored more closely, and it is required to adopt measures aimed at addressing the source of difficulties, taking into account recommendations stemming from the Union’s economic governance framework. Finally, upon request from the Commission, the concerned Member State can also be required to provide additional information related to its financial sector. Secondly, Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 also sets out the legal framework for macroeconomic adjustment programmes associated with financial assistance from the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) or the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), ensuring that they are properly aligned and synchronised with the Union’s economic governance framework. Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 exempts the concerned Member State from submitting a stability programme, which is instead integrated into the macroeconomic adjustment programme. In addition, the concerned Member State is exempted from submitting reports when it is subject to an excessive deficit procedure, and from the monitoring and assessment under the European Semester, to avoid overlaps and duplication of reporting. Thirdly, Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 establishes the rules governing post-programme surveillance, applicable once a macroeconomic adjustment programme ends and until 75% of the received assistance is repaid.  Since the adoption of Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 in 2013, the regulatory landscape has undergone significant changes. In particular, the Union’s economic governance framework was reformed in 2024 with the adoption of Regulations (EU) 2024/1263, 2024/1264 and Directive (EU) 2024/1265. The reform introduced new concepts and made changes to the structure of the Union’s economic governance framework. In particular, national medium-term fiscal-structural plans, introduced by Regulation (EU) 2024/1263, are the cornerstone of the 2024 reform. They replaced the Stability and Convergence Programmes and the National Reform Programmes, thereby bringing together the fiscal, reform and investment commitments of each Member State within a common framework. Given the urgency at that time for the co-legislators to agree on a reform of the EU economic governance framework, the Commission did not propose amendments to other pieces of legislation that form part of the Union’s economic governance framework.  Other relevant changes to the application of Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 have also occurred since 2013. In particular, the creation of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) has led to a new division of responsibilities for the supervision of credit entities. Furthermore, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), which was created as a temporary crisis resolution mechanism by euro area countries in June 2010, may no longer engage in new financing programmes as of 1 July 2013.  There is thus a need to ensure consistency between Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 and the reformed EU economic governance framework, as well as to reflect the institutional developments that have occurred since 2013.  In addition , since the adoption of Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 in 2013 , the Commission has gained valuable insights and experience regarding the activation of both enhanced surveillance when a euro area Member State i s in receipt of precautionary financial assistance and post-programme surveillance when a Member State exits a macroeconomic adjustment programme . In particular, experience has shown that the current design of enhanced surveillance may have a deterrent effect on Member States seeking precautionary financial assistance and may result in the application of additional surveillance when not warranted. Similarly, with regards to post-programme surveillance , the European Court of Auditors, in its Special Report No 18/2021 1 , has identified certain shortcomings in the effectiveness of post-programme surveillance, including a lack of clear focus and objectives, as well as overlaps with other economic surveillance processes, such as the European Semester. The amendments to Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 , required to reflect the reforms to the EU e conomic g overnance f ramework and recent institutional developments , also provide an opportunity to improve and fine-tune enhanced surveillance and post-programme surveillance, by incorporating the lessons learned and making targeted improvements to ensure their continued effectiveness. In doing so, the proposed amendments will introduce several simplifications to Regulation (EU) No 472 / 2013 , thus simplifying the broader EU e conomic g overnance framework, reducing administrative burden for Member States, and contributing to the Commission’s simplification agenda.  Considering the above, the objective of this proposal is first to ensure consistency between Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 and the reformed Union economic governance framework. Secondly, the proposal aims at reflecting the institutional developments that have occurred since 2013, including regarding the creation of the SSM and the fact that the EFSF can no longer enter into new financing programmes. Thirdly, in light of the experience accrued through the application of Regulation (EU) No 472/2013, the proposal also seeks to clarify the application of enhanced surveillance when a Member State whose currency is the euro is in receipt of precautionary financial assistance, explicitly linking its application to precautionary support that requires new policy measures. Similarly, the proposal seeks to clarify the objective and scope of post-programme surveillance, in order to increase its coherence with the reformed Union economic governance framework, as well as to achieve targeted streamlining, in order to avoid a duplication of reporting requirements.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  The proposed amendments to Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 are consistent with the existing policy provisions in the policy area, considering the significant changes that have occurred in the regulatory landscape since its adoption in 2013. The EU economic governance framework, which entered into force on 30 April 2024, following the amendments to Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 and the adoption of Regulation (EU) 2024/1263, introduces important modifications to the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact, and the proposed amendments to Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 ensure consistency with these changes. Specifically, the proposed amendments take into account the introduction of the medium-term fiscal-structural plan and the interaction with the enhanced surveillance procedure, as set out in Article 32 of Regulation (EU) 2024/1263. Furthermore, the proposed amendments are consistent with the creation of the SSM under Council Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013.  • Consistency with other Union policies  The proposal to amend the regulation will contribute to the Commission’s simplification agenda aimed at boosting competitiveness and safeguarding economic, social and environmental goals by reducing regulatory burdens and simplifying EU laws thereby making their implementation easier.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  The legal basis of the proposal is Article 136 in combination with Article 121(6) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Article 136 provides that in order to ensure the proper functioning of economic and monetary union, and in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Treaties, the Council shall, in accordance with the relevant procedure from among those referred to in Articles 121 and 126, adopt measures specific to those Member States whose currency is the euro: (a) to strengthen the coordination and surveillance of their budgetary discipline; (b) to set out economic policy guidelines for them, while ensuring that they are compatible with those adopted for the whole of the Union and are kept under surveillance. Article 121(6) provides that the European Parliament and the Council may, acting by means of regulations in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, adopt detailed rules for the multilateral surveillance of Member States.  Articles 136 and 121(6) TFEU have been used as the legal basis for Regulation (EU) No 472/2013, which would be amended by the current proposal.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  The economic and financial stability of the euro area has a Union dimension, as the implications of macroeconomic imbalances and financial distress in one Member State can have consequences for the entire euro area. Given the interconnectedness of the European economy, Member States acting alone would not be able to adequately address the complexities and spill-over effects of economic instability. Furthermore, the objectives of the amendments, namely, to ensure consistency with the reformed EU economic governance framework and streamline that framework, cannot be achieved at the level of the Member States as they require changes to EU legislation. The proposal is therefore in conformity with the subsidiarity principle set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU).  • Proportionality  The proposal respects the proportionality principle set out in Article 5 of the TEU, as it aims to update and refine the existing framework for enhanced surveillance, macroeconomic adjustment programmes, and post-programme surveillance, while ensuring that the proposed measures are limited to what is necessary to achieve these objectives. The policy choices outlined in the proposal, such as clarifying the objectives of post-programme surveillance and making enhanced surveillance more reactive to risks, are designed to address specific deficiencies and limitations identified in the current framework. These changes are necessary to achieve the objectives of preventing and correcting macroeconomic imbalances, ensuring the financial stability of the euro area, and promoting economic convergence. The proposal does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the consistency of the EU economic governance framework and the simplification of that framework, as it builds upon existing structures and processes, and introduces targeted adjustments to address specific challenges, such as the lack of clear objectives for post-programme surveillance and the need for more differentiated surveillance regimes.  • Choice of the instrument  Article 121(6) TFEU provides for the adoption of regulations. Therefore, a regulation amending Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 is the appropriate legal instrument.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  Backward looking assessments of the EU e conomic g overnance framework , also comprising an assessment of Regulation (EU) 472/2013 , were published in February 2020 2 and November 2022 3 . The Commission Communication of February 2020 was accompanied by a Commission Staff Working Document 4 .  The Commission's February 2020 communication found that the framework for surveillance of Member States experiencing, or threatened with, serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability had led to a number of improvements and generally worked well. Nonetheless, the importance of retaining adequate national ownership of programmes was highlighted, as well as that issues of transparency and accountability also persist. In particular, the Commission Staff Working Document found that Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 allowed to preserve the financial stability of the euro area, notably by establishing procedures related to macroeconomic adjustment programmes. It also found that Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 contributed to a closer coordination of economic policies and a sustained convergence of euro area Member States by ensuring consistency between the normal surveillance cycle of the European Semester and the strengthened surveillance under Regulation (EU) No 472/2013. In its communication of November 2022, the Commission suggested to make changes to the application of post-programme surveillance, by focusing the scope of surveillance on (i) assessing repayment capacity through considering the economic, fiscal and financial situation; (ii) monitoring the implementation of unfinished reforms that begun under the adjustment programme; and (iii) assessing whether corrective measures are needed in the context of concerns for repayment capacity or continued market access. It was also suggested to link the intensity of post-programme surveillance with the change in focus and with the assessment of risks.  The European Court of Auditors, in its Special Report No 18/2021, found that while post-programme surveillance was an appropriate tool, its efficiency was hampered by unclear objectives and insufficient streamlining and focus on implementation. This report also highlighted the need for a clearer focus and objectives for post-programme surveillance, as well as a reduction in administrative burden and overlaps with other economic surveillance processes, such as the European Semester.  • Stakeholder consultations  Since the adoption of Regulation (EU) No 472/2013, in 2021, the European Court of Auditors issued its Special Report 18/2021 on the Commission’s surveillance of Member States exiting a macroeconomic adjustment programme. This report recommended streamlining and improvements to the scope and procedure of post-programme surveillance in order to avoid duplications of reporting and to limit administrative burden on Member State’s authorities.  Discussions have taken place between the Commission and Member States in the Economic and Financial Committee (EFC) and the Eurogroup Working Group (EWG) on the main elements of amendments to Regulation (EU) No 472/2013, where Member States expressed an openness to examine the proposals for simplification that would be put forward by the Commission. Furthermore, a discussion took place with the ECON committee of the European Parliament , which emphasised the objectives of the simplification package, namely, to provide legal clarity and targeted simplification, and sketched out the main elements of amendments to Regulation (EU) No 472/2013, similar to the information provided to the Member States in the respective committees.  • Collection and use of expertise  N/A  • Impact assessment  This proposal does not create a new instrument but amends existing legislation to ensure consistency of the economic and budgetary surveillance of Member States in the euro area experiencing or threatened with serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability with other elements of the reformed EU economic governance framework. The proposal also aims to simplify existing procedures and to reduce the reporting requirements for Member States. The proposed amendments focus on targeted changes to the existing Regulation (EU) No 472/2013. As stated above in the section dedicated to compliance with the principle of subsidiarity, there are no other options for eliminating these inconsistencies between this regulation and other elements of the framework. For these reasons, no formal impact assessment was carried out.  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  N/A  • Fundamental rights  The proposal does not have consequences on fundamental rights.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  The proposal does not have implications for the EU budget.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  The proposed amendments to Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 do not require measures to facilitate their implementation and do not pose implementation challenges for Member States.  Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 requires that the Commission produce a report every five years on the application of the regulation, reviewing the following elements: (1) the effectiveness of the regulation in promoting its objectives; (2) the progress in ensuring closer coordination of economic policies and sustained convergence of economic performance of the Member States; (3) the contribution of the regulation to achieving sustainable and inclusive growth and social and economic resilience. The report of the Commission should be accompanied, where appropriate, by a proposal to amend the regulation.  • Explanatory documents (for directives)  N/A  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  The proposal makes targeted changes to Regulation (EU) No 472/2013. They consist in eliminating inconsistencies with the pieces of legislation that resulted from the 2024 reform of the EU economic governance framework, and institutional developments that have occurred since 2013, as well as in simplifying and clarifying elements in line with the Commission’s simplification agenda aimed at reducing regulatory burdens and simplifying EU laws to make their implementation easier.  Inconsistencies in Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 largely concern outdated references to other acts and financial assistance frameworks that are no longer applicable, including as a result of the 2024 reform of the EU economic governance framework, requiring amendments to Articles 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10 and 12. More specifically: (i) a number of cross-references to former Regulation (EU) No 1466/97 and Regulation (EU) No 1467/97 became outdated and are proposed to be updated to reflect the 2024 reform of the EU economic governance framework which consisted in repealing Regulation (EU) 1466/97 and replacing it with Regulation (EU) 2024/1263, and in amending Regulation (EU) No 1467/97; (ii) outdated references to Stability and National Reform Programmes of Member States have been removed, as they have been merged into national medium-term fiscal-structural plans following the 2024 reform; (iii) outdated references to the exemption of Member States subject to a macroeconomic adjustment programme under Article 7 of Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 from submitting a stability programme under Article 3 of Regulation (EU) No 1466/97 have been replaced by references to national-medium term fiscal structural plans, where the obligations outlined in the national medium-term fiscal-structural plan should be integrated into the design of the macroeconomic adjustment programme; and iv) Article 12 on the exemption of monitoring and assessment of the European Semester for economic policy coordination when a Member State is subject to a macroeconomic adjustment programme is removed as this exemption became obsolete following the reform to the EU economic governance framework. Additionally, references to the EFSF have been removed with respect to future financial assistance obtained by Member States from this Facility, as it is no longer active as a lending institution for new financial assistance programmes.  The proposed amendments to Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 align its provisions with the new division of tasks introduced by Council Regulation (EU) 1024/2013, which conferred specific prudential supervision responsibilities to the ECB. To ensure consistency with this new framework, the proposed amendments to Article 3 make a reference to this new division of tasks, particularly when a Member State under enhanced surveillance is required to carry out stress test exercises or sensitivity analyses to assess the resilience of the financial sector or submit regular assessments of its supervisory capacities over the financial sector.  Furthermore, the proposed amendments to Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 aim at addressing the concern that the current design of enhanced surveillance may deter Member States from seeking precautionary financial assistance when needed. To strike a balance between effective surveillance and the need to avoid disincentivising Member States to seek precautionary assistance, when necessary, the amendments aim to clarify the circumstances under which enhanced surveillance applies to Member States receiving precautionary financial assistance. Specifically, Articles 2 and 3 propose that enhanced surveillance should only be automatically triggered when a Member State receives financial assistance that requires the adoption of new policy measures, regardless of whether the assistance is provided by other Member States, third countries, the EFSM, ESM, or international financial institutions like the IMF. This means that Member States receiving financial assistance with conditions, such as an ESM Enhanced Conditions Credit Line (ECCL), as established in Article 14 of the Treaty establishing the European Stability Mechanism, should be subject to enhanced surveillance, even if the assistance has not yet been drawn. For new ESM precautionary financial assistance instruments, the Commission should assess on a case-by-case basis whether the receipt of such assistance warrants enhanced surveillance, ensuring a more nuanced and targeted approach to surveillance. The additional ability for the Commission to voluntarily subject Member States to enhance surveillance, if warranted, remains.  The proposed changes to Article 14 clarify the scope and objective of post-programme surveillance, where post-programme surveillance would focus on monitoring and assessing the repayment capacity of Member States that have received financial assistance, as well as the implementation of relevant reforms not already covered by the national medium-term fiscal-structural plan. The surveillance will also identify the need for corrective measures to mitigate any risks to repayment. By clarifying the objectives and focus of post-programme surveillance, the amended regulation provides a simplified and proportionate framework for the surveillance of Member States exiting a macroeconomic adjustment programme.  Furthermore, the amendments introduce a tiered system of post-programme surveillance that differentiates the level of scrutiny according to repayment risk and the need for corrective measures. This enables a more reactive and targeted approach to post-programme surveillance. A key feature of this system is a specific assessment of the Member State's capacity to repay the financial assistance received, which will be carried out by the Commission five years after the application of post-programme surveillance. This assessment will consider factors such as debt sustainability, debt-to-GDP ratio, excessive deficit procedures, borrowing conditions and financial stability conditions. If the Commission concludes that there are no material risks to repayment and after the Economic and Financial Committee has delivered an opinion, it would be possible to suspend regular assessments for a period of five years, subject to certain conditions. This facilitates a more effective use of resources in supporting the Member State's efforts to exit a macroeconomic adjustment programme and promote a more efficient and targeted application of post-programme surveillance, in line with the Commission’s overall simplification efforts.  A new Article 18a provides for the establishment of administrative arrangements between the Commission and relevant providers of financial assistance to euro area Member States, including the ESM. The purpose of these arrangements is to facilitate close cooperation and information-sharing between the Commission and these providers, thereby ensuring a coordinated and cohesive approach to economic surveillance and financial assistance.  The application of Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 to Member States that were in receipt of financial assistance on 30 May 2013 (Article 16) and the transitional provisions (Article 17) are proposed to be deleted as they are outdated.  Finaly, the future reviews of the functioning of Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 were aligned to the reviews on the functioning of Regulation (EU) 2024/1263 (Article 19).  2025/0312 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 as regards the economic and budgetary surveillance of Member States in the euro area experiencing or threatened with serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 136 in combination with Article 121(6) thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank 5 ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) Regulation (EU) No 47 2 /2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council 6 lays down provisions for strengthening the economic and budgetary surveillance of Member States whose currency is the euro, where those Member States (a) experience or are threatened with serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability or to the sustainability of their public finances, leading to potential adverse spill-over effects on other Member States in the euro area; or (b) request or receive financial assistance.  (2) The Union’s economic governance framework was reformed in 2024. The reform aimed to facilitate effective economic surveillance, anchored in a common framework that ensures equal treatment and multilateral policy coordination. The objectives of the reform were to further promote sound and sustainable public finances, sound and inclusive growth and resilience through reforms and investment, prevent the occurrence of excessive deficits, and strengthen national ownership. To achieve those objectives, the reform introduced new concepts and made changes to the structure of the Union’s economic governance framework. The reform was implemented with the adoption of Regulation (EU) 2024/1263 of the European Parliament and of the Council 7 , Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1264 8 and Council Directive (EU) 2024/1265 9 .  (3) In its Communication of 11 February 2025 entitled ‘A simpler and faster Europe: Communication on implementation and simplification’ 10 , the Commission set out a vision for an implementation and simplification agenda that aims to boost competitiveness and safeguard economic, social and environmental goals by reducing regulatory burdens and simplifying Union law thereby making its implementation easier.  (4) In the context of the 2024 reform of the Union’s economic governance framework and with the view to simplifying, consolidating and codifying legislation, amendments to Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 are necessary to ensure consistency with other acts of the economic governance framework and contribute to its streamlining and simplification.  (5) The national medium-term fiscal-structural plans, introduced by Regulation (EU) 2024/1263, are the cornerstone of the 2024 reform. They replaced the Stability and Convergence Programmes and the National Reform Programmes, thereby bringing together the fiscal, reform and investment commitments of each Member State within a common framework. Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 should be amended to take into account the introduction of the national medium-term fiscal-structural plans in the common framework. In particular, the obligations arising from a national medium-term fiscal-structural plan should be duly taken into account in the design of a macroeconomic adjustment programme, with a view to ensuring a coherent and effective approach to addressing the Member State's fiscal and macroeconomic challenges. Furthermore, in accordance with Article 32 of Regulation (EU) 2024/1263, where a Member State is subject to a macroeconomic adjustment programme, it should not be required to submit a national medium-term fiscal-structural plan or an annual progress report.  (6) The European Financial Stability Facility ( ‘ EFSF ’ ) was created as a temporary crisis resolution mechanism by euro area countries in June 2010. As of 1 July 2013, the EFSF may no longer engage in new financing programmes . Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 should be amended to take that into account.  (7) Experience has shown that the current design of enhanced surveillance may have a deterrent effect on Member States seeking precautionary financial assistance and may result in the application of additional surveillance when not warranted. In order to strike a balance between the need for effective surveillance and the need to avoid disincentivising Member States to seek precautionary assistance when necessary, Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 should be amended to clarify the circumstances under which enhanced surveillance applies when a Member States is in receipt of precautionary financial assistance.  (8) A Member State that receives financial assistance on a precautionary basis from one or several other Member States or third countries, the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism ( ‘ EFSM ’ ), the European Stability Mechanism ( ‘ ESM ’ ) or another relevant international financial institution, such as the International Monetary Fund ( ‘ IMF ’ ), which requires the adoption of new policy measures, should be subject to enhanced surveillance under Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 , including if that financial assistance is not yet drawn. An ESM Enhanced Conditions Credit Line ( ‘ ECCL ’ ) requires such new policy measures and, as such, a Member State receiving such financial assistance on a precautionary basis should be subject to enhanced surveillance. With regard to new ESM precautionary financial assistance instruments, the Commission should assess on a case-by-case basis whether there are such new policy measures and, as such, whether the receipt of such financial assistance by a Member State warrants the application of enhanced surveillance under Regulation (EU) No 472 /2013 .  (9) Council Regulation (EU) 1024/2013 11 conferred specific tasks on the European Central Bank (‘ECB’) concerning policies relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions.  In order to respect the division of responsibilities between the ECB and national competent authorities of participating Member States as established by that Regulation, the provisions in Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 concerning information on or supervisory measures regarding the financial sector should be clarified to respect that division of responsibilities.  (10) Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 provides that a Member State exiting a macroeconomic adjustment programme is subject to post-programme surveillance until 75% of the received financial assistance is repaid. The European Court of Auditors, in its Special Report No 18/2021 12 , has identified certain shortcomings in the effectiveness of post-programme surveillance, including a lack of clear focus and objectives, as well as overlaps with other economic surveillance processes, such as the European Semester.  (11) In light of th o se findings, it is necessary to amend Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 to clarify the objective and scope of post-programme surveillance, in order to increase its coherence with the European e conomic g overnance framework and avoid a duplication of reporting requirements. Specifically, post-programme surveillance should focus on monitoring and assessing the repayment capacity of the concerned Member State regarding the financial assistance received , taking into account the economic, budgetary and financial condition of that Member State . That surveillance should also cover the implementation of certain reforms, to the extent that those are not already subject to monitoring under the national medium-term fiscal-structural plan. Finally, post-programme surveillance should identify the need for corrective measures to mitigate risks to the repayment of the financial assistance received.  (12) It is also necessary to amend Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 to make post-programme surveillance more proportionate to risks, by introducing a tiered system of surveillance that differentiates the level of scrutiny according to repayment risk of the financial assistance received and the need for corrective measures. In particular, five years after the application of post-programme surveillance, the Commission should be allowed to carry out a specific assessment of the Member State's capacity to repay the financial assistance received. If the Commission concludes that there are no material risks to the Member State's capacity to repay the financial assistance over the medium-term, it should be possible to suspend the regular assessments for a period of five years, subject to no material change of the circumstances . Before concluding its assessment, the Commission should ask the Economic and Financial Committee for its opinion.  (13) To ensure close cooperation with the ESM and other relevant international financial institutions when implementing Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 , the Commission should continue to seek to establish the necessary administrative arrangements. Such arrangements help to ensure that the activities of the different institutions and bodies involved in the provision of financial assistance are coordinated and mutually reinforcing.  (14) Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 should therefore be amended accordingly,  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Article 1  Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 is amended as follows:  (1) in Article 1 (1) , point (b) is replaced by the following:  ‘(b) request or receive financial assistance from one or several other Member States or third countries, the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM), the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), or another relevant international financial institution such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF).’;  (2) Article 2 is amended as follows:  (a) i n paragraph 3 , the first subparagraph is replaced by the following:  ‘Where a Member State is in receipt of financial assistance on a precautionary basis from one or several other Member States or third countries, the EFSM, the ESM, or another relevant international financial institution such as the IMF that requires the adoption of new policy measures, the Commission shall subject that Member State to enhanced surveillance.’;  (b) paragraphs 4 and 5 are deleted;  (3) Article 3 is amended as follows:  (a) in paragraph 1 , the first subparagraph is replaced by the following:  ‘A Member State subject to enhanced surveillance shall, after consulting, and in cooperation with, the Commission, acting in liaison with the ECB, the ESAs, the ESRB and, where appropriate, the IMF, adopt measures aimed at addressing the sources or potential sources of difficulties.

FRAMEWORK OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE  1.1. Title of the proposal/initiative  Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on amending Regulation (EU) No 472/2013.  1.2. Policy area(s) concerned  Strengthening of economic and budgetary surveillance of Member States in the euro area experiencing or threatened with serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability.  1.3. Objective(s)  1.3.1. General objective(s)  A first objective of the proposal is to align the legal framework established by Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 with the reformed EU economic governance framework which entered into force on 30 April 2024, repealing  Regulation (EU) No 1466/97 (and replacing it with Regulation (EU) 2024/1263) and amending Regulation (EU) No 1467/97, as well as to reflect the institutional developments that have occurred since 2013.  A second objective is to take into account the valuable experience and insights accrued through the application of Regulation (EU) No 472/2013, by clarifying the scope and application of both enhanced surveillance and post-programme surveillance. In doing so, the proposal will also contribute to the streamlining and simplification of the EU economic governance framework.  1.3.2. Specific objective(s)  To ensure consistency with the reformed EU economic governance framework, the proposed amendments to Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 will (i) update references to documents and concepts introduced by the 2024 reform, as well as cross-references to the pieces of legislation that were amended as part of that reform; (ii) remove obsolete procedures and the requirement for Member States to produce documents and additional reporting obligations that are no longer necessary following the 2024 reform.  In addition, taking into account the accrued experiences with the application of enhanced surveillance, the amendments will seek to clarify the application of enhanced surveillance when a euro area Member State is in receipt of precautionary financial assistance. Finally, taking into account relevant findings from the European Court of Auditors, the proposed amendments to Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 will clarify the scope and objective of post-programme surveillance, as well as its application, with a potential to streamline surveillance when warranted.  1.3.3. Expected result(s) and impact  The proposal should prevent duplication of reporting and lead to a reduction of administrative burden for euro area Member States threatened with financial stability issues. Furthermore, the proposal should avoid disincentivising euro area Member States from requesting precautionary financial assistance when required. Finally, the proposal should clarify the scope and objective of post-programme surveillance, resulting in a better implementation of the EU economic governance framework.  1.3.4. Indicators of performance  The Commission will produce a report every five years, reviewing (i) the effectiveness of the regulations in achieving their objectives; (ii) the progress in ensuring closer coordination of economic policies and sustained convergence of economic performances of the Member States in accordance with the TFEU; and (iii) the contribution of the regulations to achieving sustainable and inclusive growth and social and economic resilience. Where appropriate, the report would be accompanied by a proposal to amend the regulations.  1.4. The proposal/initiative relates to:   a new action   a new action following a pilot project / preparatory action 13   the extension of an existing action   a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action  1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative  1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative  N/A  1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, greater effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this section 'added value of EU involvement' is the value resulting from EU action, that is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.  Reasons for action at EU level (ex-ante): The action at EU level is necessary given the role conferred by the EU Treaties to ensure the coordination and surveillance of the economic and budgetary policies of Member States and in particular of euro area Member States, which are subject to stronger economic spillover effects including relating to financial stability. Actions by Member States alone cannot achieve these goals.  Expected generated EU added value ( ex-post ): The adoption of the amended regulation will lead to a better implementation of the EU economic governance framework by Member States, while simultaneously reducing Member States’ reporting requirements.  1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past  N/A  1.5.4. Compatibility with the multiannual financial framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments  N/A  1.5.5. Assessment of the different available financing options, including scope for redeployment  N/A  1.6. Duration of the proposal/initiative and of its financial impact   limited duration  –  in effect from [DD/MM]YYYY to [DD/MM]YYYY  –  financial impact from YYYY to YYYY for commitment appropriations and from YYYY to YYYY for payment appropriations.   unlimited duration  – Implementation with a start-up period from YYYY to YYYY,  – followed by full-scale operation.  1.7.

This update aims to align the 2013 framework with recent changes in the EU's economic governance and institutional developments. Originally, the regulation was designed to monitor and support countries experiencing financial instability, either through enhanced surveillance or by integrating them into macroeconomic adjustment programs linked to financial assistance from the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). It also included provisions for ongoing surveillance after financial assistance was provided, until a significant portion of the aid was repaid.

Since its inception, the EU's economic governance framework has seen significant reforms, introducing new concepts like national medium-term fiscal-structural plans. Additionally, the establishment of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) has changed the supervision landscape for financial entities, and the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) has stopped engaging in new financing programs. The proposed amendments aim to ensure consistency between the existing regulation and the updated governance framework, addressing issues identified in past applications, such as the deterrent effect of enhanced surveillance on countries seeking financial assistance and the lack of clear objectives in post-programme surveillance.

Key changes in the proposal include broadening the scope of financial assistance sources to include not only other Member States and mechanisms like the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM) and ESM but also third countries and other relevant entities. However, the proposal does not provide for co-financing by third parties",

CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  Farming and food are strategic sectors for the Union, providing safe and high-quality food to 450 million Europeans at affordable prices and playing a key role for European as well as global food security. At the same time, they are essential for sustaining the economy and life in rural areas, as well as an important part of the solution in the protection of climate, nature, soils, water, and biodiversity currently under stress. The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is at the heart of the European project and has committed more than 60 years ago to ensuring food security and a fair standard of living for the agricultural community, in line with the EU Treaties’ objectives.  Such commitment is as relevant today as it was then, as the EU agricultural sector faces significant challenges. The sectors attractiveness for young people needs a boost, as only a fraction of farmers is younger than 40 years. The sector is exposed to climate change, biodiversity loss, and socio-economic pressures, which threaten its long-term sustainability and livelihoods. Uneven global playing fields, some import dependencies and vulnerability to geopolitical uncertainties add to the long-term uncertainty faced by EU farmers. Investments are difficult to finance as agricultural income per worker remains significantly lower than the average wages in the whole economy (60% in 2023). Additionally, territorial imbalances and, insufficient access to knowledge and innovation – including digital solutions - contribute to the declining attractiveness of the sector, particularly among young people.  These challenges make public support necessary for the sector and at the same time call for a robust and adaptive policy response to ensure a competitive, resilient, and sustainable agricultural sector. Building on the successful previous reforms that put the CAP on the path of a performance-based and market-oriented policy, the CAP thus needs to continue to evolve and sharpen its ability to respond effectively to a changing global, EU, national and regional situation, including at farm level.  EU Heads of State have repeatedly emphasized the need to enhance the resilience of EU agriculture to ensure long-term food security, preserve the vitality of rural communities, and recognize the crucial role of the CAP in achieving these goals. At the same time, they have stressed the importance of providing a stable and predictable policy framework to support farmers in addressing environmental and climate challenges.  The Political Guidelines for the Commission mandate 2024-2029 underscore the importance of ensuring that farmers have a fair and sufficient income to continue innovating and delivering benefits to the Union as a whole. To achieve this, the guidelines call for reducing bureaucratic burdens, rewarding farmers who work in harmony with nature, and strengthening their position in the food value chain to protect them from unfair trading practices. This requires striking a balance between incentives, investments, and regulation to build a more competitive and resilient agricultural sector.  The Commission's Communication of 19 February 2025, ""A Vision for Agriculture and Food,"" outlines key principles for the CAP post-2027. These principles include a CAP based on clear objectives and targeted requirements, with Member States assuming greater responsibility and accountability for meeting policy objectives. The Communication also highlights the essential role of the CAP in supporting and stabilizing farmers' incomes, attracting a new generation of farmers, and ensuring a simpler and more targeted policy with a clearer balance between incentives and mandatory requirements. Furthermore, it emphasises the need for greater flexibility for farmers and a shift from conditions to incentives. The new financial framework presents an opportunity to build on the recent reform, aligning rules for support to achieve competitiveness, resilience, innovation, and sustainability objectives in a cohesive and effective manner.  The 2023-27 CAP Strategic Plans have proven to be effective tools for integrated policy implementation, facilitating cooperation among governments, stakeholders, and civil society. The new delivery mechanism introduced in 2023 offers a policy- and performance-based approach, increasing flexibility and responsibility for Member States to address local specificities within a common EU framework. Building on this experience, there is an opportunity to further streamline the CAP's implementation and to increase synergies and flexibility within and with other spending areas.  In the context of the MFF legislative proposals for 2028-2034, this proposal dedicated to agriculture is justified by the specificities of the CAP. While the future CAP will align with the streamlined delivery mechanisms for EU spending programmes under the new MFF and its programming and delivery will be part of the National and Regional Partnership Fund and plans , this proposal lays down specific rules which are needed to steer the CAP towards:  · Contributing to a more targeted income support for farmers and their long-term competitiveness , directing support towards farmers that actively contribute to food security, towards the economic vitality of the farms and specific sectors and the preservation of the environment, while enabling access to complementary sources of income.  · Improving the attractiveness of the profession and fostering generational renewal , helping the access of young people and those entering in the profession, including though promoting skills development, better access to capital and better working conditions.  · Enhancing the role of the farming and forest sector for climate action, ecosystem services provision, the conservation of biodiversity and natural resources , by rewarding farmers who work with nature and incentivising a move towards more sustainable production methods which are adapted to the local conditions, and delivering the right balance of investments, incentives and requirements.  · Improving resilience, ability to cope with crises and risks , providing stronger and more targeted incentives for farmers to reduce their vulnerability and exposure to risks including through adaptation ad the farm level and diversification of production, promoting more ambitious transformation changes in places where business as usual is not sustainable in the longer term, and strengthening the link between prevention and crisis management.  · Accelerate innovation, enhancing access to knowledge and accelerating the digital transition for a thriving agriculture sector through strengthening agricultural knowledge and innovation systems including access to impartial and qualified advisory services, targeted training, fostering the wider uptake of digital solutions.  · Enhancing working conditions and life in rural areas, by offering relief services and support for cooperation, business development, value added and projects allowing rural development.  In achieving these objectives, the proposal aims to realise the full potential of strategic planning through a simpler and more flexible policy framework that enhances synergies and complementarities across sectors . The new Multiannual Financial Framework provides an opportunity for the EU budget spending for agriculture to be more impactful. Building on the current system based on strategic plans, the programming will benefit from a further evolution while ensuring the coherence and synergies with the common framework provided by the full set of MFF proposals, particularly the Commission proposals for a Regulation establishing the National and Regional Partnership Fund for the period 2028-2034 (‘NPRF Regulation’), the proposal for a Regulation on Common performance framework (‘Performance Regulation’), the proposal for a European Competitiveness Fund and the proposal for a Research Framework Programme . As regards pre-accession support, the proposal for a Global Europe will prepare candidate countries by putting in place the required structures for their agriculture systems to gradually align with the CAP.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  This proposal is fully consistent with the CAP TFEU objectives. It modernises the way the TFEU provisions are implemented, in line with the orientations of the MFF 2028-2034, the Vision for agriculture and food and the simplification efforts, while adapting to current challenges.  Article 39 TFEU sets out the objectives of the CAP:  · to increase agricultural productivity by promoting technical progress and by ensuring the rational development of agricultural production and the optimum utilisation of the factors of production, in particular labour;  · thus to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community, in particular by increasing the individual earnings of persons engaged in agriculture;  · to stabilise markets;  · to assure the availability of supplies;  · to ensure that supplies reach consumers at reasonable prices.  • Consistency with other Union policies  Agriculture is a major contributor to the EU global competitiveness . The Union is a large importer of commodities and an export champion for valuable agriculture and food products and has therefore an impact on food systems outside the Union. The proposal, in line with Article 208 TFEU, takes into account the Union development cooperation’s objectives of poverty eradication and sustainable development in developing countries, in particular by ensuring that Union support to farmers has no or minimal trade effects.  Agriculture and forestry cover 84% of the Union territory. The sector both depends on and influences the state of the environment. CAP specific objectives naturally include environmental and climate action . For example, the CAP contributes to climate adaptation and water resilience, such as flood risk mitigation and water management through landscape restoration, while also supporting biodiversity and conservation initiatives. Similarly, the CAP can support renewable energy projects and bioeconomy, thus contributing to the EU’s energy transition and circularity objectives.  The proposal puts a strong focus on supporting young farmers and promotes generational renewal , in line with the Commission’s focus on youth .  The CAP supports income for farmers and thus contributes to the enhancement of social objectives and policies in several important ways: targets farmers most in need, supports the diverse socio-cultural characteristics of EU rural areas, including job creation and good workers conditions in farming and rural areas. It is necessary to protect final beneficiaries and ensure predictability for the income support component of the CAP and to target and steer the support efforts, which this regulation provides for. Finally, the CAP finances skills and knowledge to support farmers in their socio-economic, green and digital transition. Strengthened agricultural education, lifelong learning opportunities, and peer-to-peer. With the new structure it can better align its instruments with the national training systems and research programmes.  Agriculture has a direct link with the “ one health ” concept. In this respect, the proposal provides a set of instruments that aim at ensuring high quality food production, reducing use of pesticides and antimicrobials, improving animal welfare conditions, as well as biosecurity measures at farm level to prevent outbreaks of pests and animal diseases.  The CAP contributes to cohesion and the right to stay by fostering a diverse and resilient rural economy in rural areas , supporting for example business opportunities, agro-tourism, infrastructure, and the bioeconomy via its LEADER strategies. This aligns with the Long-Term Vision for Rural Areas goals, emphasizing economic diversification in rural environments for farmers.  Like in other sectors, agriculture and rural areas should make better use of innovation to enhance competitiveness, sustainability and resilience. New technology and knowledge, in particular digital technologies, improve resource efficiency. The proposal reinforces the links to research policy by putting the organisation of knowledge exchange prominently in the policy delivery model. The CAP and the EU research and innovation policy can significantly enhance agricultural sector competitiveness and resilience. Similarly, the emphasis placed on digitisation allows linking up to the EU Digital and AI Agenda, but also limit reporting burden.  There are many opportunities for synergies between the CAP and other EU policies, that the new planning mechanism will allow to better exploit.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  Article 38 TFEU empowers the Union to define and implement a common agriculture policy. Article 39 TFEU sets the objectives of the CAP, which include the increase of agricultural productivity, a fair standard of living for the agricultural community, stabilise markets, assure the availability of supplies and that these supplies reach consumers at reasonable prices.  The legal basis for this proposal is Article 43(2) TFEU.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union provides for shared competence for agriculture between the Union and the Member States, while establishing a common agricultural policy with common objectives and a common implementation.  In the current delivery model, the Union has moved towards setting the basic policy parameters (objectives of the CAP, broad types of intervention, basic requirements), while Member States take greater responsibility and are more accountable for how they meet the objectives and achieve agreed targets. In this framework, the proposal for the CAP post-2027 continues to ensure a level playing field among Member States and farmers in the single market, guaranteeing food security throughout the Union, and addressing challenges of a cross-border and global nature.  In line with the Vision for Agriculture and Food and seeing the Union's highly diversified farming environment with different physical parameters, a one-size-fits-all approach is not suitable to delivering the desired results. A greater level of integration with various policies and flexibility for Member States will make it possible to better take into account local conditions and needs. Member States will be in charge of tailoring CAP interventions to maximise their contribution to Union objectives, based on recommendations from the Commission.  • Proportionality  The economic, environmental and social challenges facing the EU's farming sector and rural areas require a substantial response and a lasting effort which does justice to the EU dimension of those challenges. The CAP policy framework is accompanied by a robust and commensurate budget in the NRPF. The greater power of choice offered to Member States in selecting and adapting available policy tools within the CAP to meet EU common objectives, is proportionate  to the level of action required in the face of needs and challenges.  • Choice of the instrument  The Common agricultural policy has its legal basis in Articles 42-43 TFEU and has shown over more than 60 years of history that it remains relevant, necessary and is evolving over time. A well targeted policy, providing the right steer will ensure the right conditions for farmers and rural areas to strive and ensure food security and generational renewal in a sustainable way.  The legal act sets out the specific policy aspects genuine to the CAP, its focus and its steer, creating rights for and obligations on Member States and final beneficiaries. Due to its long-term and strategic nature, and the nature of its expenditure being income support, investments and cooperation an integrated but self-standing legal basis is justified. Taking into account the overall MFF governance system, the most appropriate vehicle to operationalize the proposed framework is a dedicated regulation on the Common Agriculture Policy, which complements the proposed NRPF Regulation and Performance Regulation with specific provisions applicable to Common Agriculture Policy. It works together with the CMO, as in the past.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  In November 2023, the Commission published a report on the joint efforts of all the CAP Strategic Plans in the EU Member States (under the currently applicable Regulation (EU) 2021/2115) highlighting some key elements:  · The new CAP Strategic Plans are an appropriate tool to pursue the CAP policy objectives;  · The CAP Strategic Plans show continued support for farm income, economic sustainability and resilience of the agricultural sector;  · There is a need to reinforce risk management tools and their increased uptake across the Union through EU or national schemes;  · The plans are greener than in the previous CAP period; but there is more potential to contribute to climate change mitigation, in particular by enhancing carbon sequestration, while climate adaptation challenges call for a more holistic and longer-term approach that requires relevant management practices and investment;  · There is progress on sustainable management of natural resources, in particular on soil and reducing dependency on chemical inputs;  · More holistic approaches to specific sectors will be needed, encompassing their economic, social and environmental vulnerabilities and benefits: for example, enhancing the positive influence of extensive livestock systems on biodiversity, carbon sequestration, landscapes, cultural heritage and rural livelihoods;  · And, lastly, the overall situation also depends on elements outside the CAP, as well as on other external factors such as the evolution of markets and consumer preferences.  In that overview report summarising the collective ambition and joint effort of Member States, the Commission considered that additional attention is particularly needed on the following areas: reinforcing skills, training and advisory capacity at all levels; fostering exchanges of good practices to better guide Member States and stakeholders; reducing the administrative burden of specific interventions; and monitoring implementation and results (as well as adjusting CAP Strategic Plans where necessary).  • Stakeholder consultations  The Commission actively engaged with stakeholders in the preparation of the MFF initiatives.  A strategic dialogue on the future of EU agriculture was launched in January 2024, bringing together 29 key stakeholders from the European agri-food sectors, civil society, rural communities and academia to reach a common understanding and set a vision for the future of EU's farming and food systems. The Strategic Dialogue highlighted the need to continue providing socio-economic support targeted to the farmers who need it most; promoting positive environmental, social, and animal welfare outcomes for society; and invigorating enabling conditions for rural areas. It found that reaching the EU’s objectives in terms of agriculture and food production, rural development, climate neutrality, and biodiversity restoration requires a dedicated and commensurate budget that matches all ambitions in a balanced and equal importance. Such principle is essential for making the transition economically profitable, promoting generational renewal, invigorating rural areas and supporting farms at a competitive disadvantage, yet essential for agricultural diversity in the EU.  Furthermore, in the framework of the recently established European Board for Agriculture and Food (EBAF), bringing together organisations representing the farming community, other actors of the food supply chain, and civil society, a dedicated discussion took place on 19 May 2025 and on 19-20 June 2025 on how to better target direct payments and move from conditions to incentives in the CAP post-2027.  Additional inputs on the future of the CAP were collected through dedicated meetings organized in the framework of existing EU stakeholders' platforms and ad-hoc technical workshops bringing together EU stakeholders and Member States.  • Collection and use of expertise  In order to gather evidence and knowledge from experts on CAP-related issues a set of technical workshops were organised between December 2023 and May 2024. These workshops allowed to exchange views between EU stakeholders, Member States and Commission services, and to advance in the formulation of the key conclusions and issues to take into account in the modernisation and simplification process of the CAP.  The first workshop on resilience concluded on the need to strengthen risk management tools at farm level and risk sharing opportunities along the value chain, with a more holistic approach, including on prevention. A second workshop focused on food security, a third workshop on sustainability concluded with a broad support on the need to help farmers in testing new innovations, more independent advice. A fourth workshop on CAP governance and performance confirmed the overall support for the new delivery model of the CAP, participants called on the need of stability, flexibility and simplification (especially for farmers); explore more voluntary approaches; increase the ability to respond to external shocks; proportionality in controls and penalties.  A last workshop focused on solidarity and rural areas and highlighted a general support to ensure more integrated policy responses, essential for the breadth of rural challenges, CAP cannot do it all, best practices exist but are not picked up, and the need for more capacity building for administrations and simpler frameworks.  A Commission foresight project on digital transition for farmers and rural communities included a series of participatory workshops with stakeholders, between March 2022 and May 2023. The Commission participated, alongside the Member States, in the foresight exercise undertaken by the Spanish Presidency on Open Strategic Autonomy, that included agri-food as part of four strategic sectors.  Finally, an implementation dialogue in June 2025 chaired by Commissioner Hansen allowed to identify priorities to improve the current CAP instruments.  • Impact assessment  The proposal was informed by the impact assessment carried out in the context of the MFF 2028-2034 Commission NPRF proposal, which evaluated options for the NPR plan's design, focusing on two key aspects: the delivery model, which determines how funds are disbursed, and the management mode, which governs how EU spending is implemented and overseen.  The impact assessment evaluated options for integrating the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) into a single plan.  Option 1 (CAP outside of the NPR Plans) would be building on the expertise gained from implementing the current CAP Strategic Plans. This approach would ensure continuity, allow for manageable changes, and clarify responsibilities at the Union and national levels.  The further integration of CAP would bring further simplification and greater synergies in achieving the policy’s objectives and ensure predictability for beneficiaries. On the other hand, a one-fund approach for the future CAP, while allowing for targeted support, would limit the ability to address emerging or unforeseen needs and changing priorities. However, to enhance efficiency, there is potential for additional harmonization of key policy design aspects, such as monitoring, performance, and audit systems, across the future Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF). This would create synergies in administrative procedures, reducing costs for Member States.  In contrast, the impact assessment shows that fully integrating the CAP (Option 2b) would necessitate introducing specific rules to ensure the integrity of the single market and fair competition among farmers, particularly for instruments directly supporting farm income, such as direct payments, which are crucial for farmers' livelihoods.  According to the impact assessment having one plan per Member State would ensure more coherent programming, reflecting national and regional needs while supporting Union priorities. A single envelope per Member State would enable efficient and flexible allocation of funding, allowing for easy reallocation of resources to address new priorities or challenges. Overall, the impact assessment concludes that a broader scope and integrated management approach would bring significant benefits, including increased coherence, simplicity, and flexibility.  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  Simplification is an overarching priority of the Commission with the aim to reduce burden and over complexity and favour speed and flexibility.  The number of provisions relating to the common agricultural policy has been drastically reduced, and coherence achieved between the relevant articles in the NRPP, the CAP regulation and the Common market organisation regulation. Overall, the level of detail and number of requirements is reduced while emphasis is put on provisions essential for the functioning of the CAP legal framework. This leads not only to a reduction in the overall number of provisions but also improves the overall quality of the legislation and reduces its complexity, while providing more flexibility for Member States to adjust the common CAP instruments to their specific needs and challenges.  By integrating interventions from the current two-fund structure (EAGF and EAFRD), the proposal aligns tools for competitiveness, resilience, innovation, and sustainability objectives, allowing them to work jointly towards better outcomes. This alignment not only enhances the effectiveness of the support available but also brings greater flexibility and simplification to its management, ultimately leading to more efficient and targeted interventions for farmers and authorities alike. This increased flexibility gives Member States room to design, plan and implement the tools for CAP support in the way that best addresses the specific needs of the sector.  Simplification for beneficiaries will be achieved, inter alia , through:  · simplification of conditionality (farm stewardship) . Reduction in the number of types of interventions (many merged e.g. eco - schemes and agri-env-climate commitments, significant reduction of schemes in direct payments), improved focusing of the types of interventions, key requirements only in the Regulation;  · offering more lump sums. This will allow for simplified application procedures that will reduce the burden for beneficiaries and administrations.  Simplification for Member States comes from:  · Single fund: no complex rules about transfers, no separate sets of rules for each fund Moving the burden of control from Paying agencies to existing national control competent bodies thus reducing the risks for multiple control checks on farm ;  · t he proposal also aligns timelines for payments, removing rigidities while ensuring timely payments to farmers, thus allowing a closer link to the actual implementation of interventions.  • Fundamental rights  This proposal respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union as laid down in the Commission proposal for NPRF Regulation. The provisions of that proposed Regulation concerning respect of fundamental rights and the rule of law will apply also to the support for common agriculture policy.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  In order to reap the benefits of the national and regional partnership planning, the Commission proposal on the multiannual financial framework for 2028-2034 (insert reference) includes the common agricultural policy in the NRPF. A significant part of the Fund is dedicated to income support for agriculture, which is ringfenced with a minimum of EUR 293.7 billion from the allocations of the Fund, in order to provide stability and predictability of support for beneficiaries.  This funding can be augmented within the NRPF by synergetic programming of actions that serve more than one objective, such as agro-energy, skills and social infrastructure, water or connectivity, to give just a few examples. Furthermore, the NRPF Regulation will provide funding for promotions of agricultural products,   crisis interventions and the unity safety net (integrating the current agricultural reserve) under the Facility to the tune of EUR 6.3 billion, as well as the funding part of the technical assistance for e.g. networks or monitoring. .  Funding for agriculture can benefit from projects under the European Competitiveness Fund and remain an integral part of the European Research Framework Programme, under their windows for Health, Agriculture and Bioeconomy to support research and innovation in food, agriculture, rural development and the bioeconomy. The combination will allow to preserve the tools currently available, for use in an optimised way.  Details on the financial impact of the CAP proposal are set out in the financial statement accompanying the NRPP proposal.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  This initiative will be monitored through the performance framework applicable for the 2028-2034 multiannual financial framework, which is set out in the proposal for a Regulation [performance regulation]. The performance framework provides for an implementation report during the implementation phase of the programme, as well as a retrospective evaluation to be carried out in accordance with Article 34(3) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 1 . The evaluation shall be conducted in accordance with the Commission's Better Regulation Guidelines and will be based on indicators relevant to the objectives of the Fund.  • Explanatory documents (for directives)  Not applicable.  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  This proposal is part of the MMF 2028-2034 package, including NRPF Regulation and Performance Regulation which provide funding, the framework for horizontal principles, rules on the management of the NRP Fund, financial framework, general rules concerning the content and approval of the NRP Plans and their governance, as well as the assurance package, we well as the performance framework and monitoring framework.  This proposal complements these general rules with specific rules applying to common agricultural policy and Agriculture chapter of the NRP Plans.  The proposal is also complementary to the rules set out in the proposed Regulation amending Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 2 , which will provide for rules concerning interventions in certain sectors and the school schemes.  Common Agriculture Policy Regulation:  Articles 1 and 2 provide for the scope, CAP national recommendations to be adopted and steering. Articles 3 and 4 outline elements of the environmental, climate and social architecture of the CAP including environmental and climate priority areas. Article 5 lists all CAP interventions and sets out provisions concerning Income support interventions. Articles from 6 to 20 outline requirements for CAP interventions as well as provisions for targeting.  Articles 15 and 16 detail provisions related to generational renewal provides for the starter pack for young farmers, consisting of a comprehensive set of interventions aimed at young farmers facilitating entry and establishment of farmers in the agricultural sector. Articles 18, 19, 20 cover other interventions under the CAP funded from the allocations for the NRP Plans. It establishes types of intervention for cooperation, LEADER, support for knowledge sharing and innovation in agriculture, forestry and rural areas and establishes other actions for the CAP.  Article 21 sets out CAP data governance, including provisions on authority in charge of data governance under the CAP.  Articles 22 to 25 contain general and final provisions, including delegation of power to the Commission to supplement this Regulation and implementing powers for the Commission to take measures to derogate from this Regulation to resolve specific problems in cases of a justifiable emergency, Committee procedure and final provisions.  2025/0241 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  establishing the conditions for the implementation of the Union support to the Common Agriculture Policy for the period from 2028 to 2034  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(2) thereof,  Having regard to the 1979 Act of Accession, and in particular paragraph 6 of Protocol No 4 on cotton attached thereto,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  Having regard to the opinion of the Court of Auditors 3 ,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 4 ,  Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions 5 ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) The Commission Communication of 19 February 2025 entitled ‘A Vision for Agriculture and Food’ 6 announces that the common agricultural policy (the ‘CAP’) post-2027 enhances responsibility and accountability for Member States on how they meet the CAP objectives, supporting and stabilising farmers’ incomes and attracting a future generation of farmers, and guaranteeing food security. The new CAP is to be a simpler and more targeted Union common policy, with more flexibility for farmers and a shift from requirements to incentives, for farmers.  (2) The multiannual financial framework (MFF) 2028 to 2034 legislative package includes Regulation (EU) .../... of the European Parliament and of the Council [ NRP ] establishing the National and Regional Partnership Fund (the ‘Fund’) for the period 2028 to 2034, grouping the nationally pre-allocated funds under the Fund, including the European Agriculture Guarantee Fund (EAGF) and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) established under Regulation (EU) 2021/2115 of the European Parliament and of the Council 7 and Regulation (EU) 2021/2116 of the European Parliament and of the Council 8 . The Fund should be implemented through National and Regional Partnership Plans (the ‘NRP Plans’) and the EU Facility, which aim at increasing flexibility and cater for crises and interventions that require Union level steering or coordination.  This Union support for the CAP will be provided under the Fund, in accordance with the rules governing that Fund set out in Regulation (EU) …/… [ NRP ].  (3) With regards to agriculture, the general objective of the Fund referred to in Article 3 , point (c), of Regulation (EU) .../... [ NRP ] recalls the objectives established in Article 39 TFEU. The CAP specific objectives directly contribute to sustaining Union’s quality of life and are to be implemented by the Member States through their NRP Plans .  (4) In order to ensure that the Union adequately addresses the most pressing challenges for the agricultural sector, it is appropriate to provide for a steering mechanism reflecting the orientations of the Vision for Agriculture and Food for a targeted policy. To advance towards a competitive, resilient and sustainable agricultural sector, in line with the outcome of the stakeholders’ consultations, the CAP national recommendations should provide a sufficient level of policy steering at Union level, to guide Member States in the design of their NRP Plans as regards agriculture, defining the relevant interventions on the basis of their specific challenges and needs.  (5) To ensure a level playing field and common framework for support for the Union agricultural sector, Member States should define the elements of the framework taking into account the local specificities and needs with the CAP objectives in mind, while the Union should provide the common framework for a policy that supports those who need it most.  (6) The CAP has showed a positive impact on generational renewal in agriculture, but there remain obstacles, in particular as regards the provision of basic infrastructure and services in rural areas, access to land and social safety net for young as well as for retiring farmers. To address the specific needs of young farmers and new entrants, each Member State should be required to set in the NRP Plan a strategy for generational renewal that should be based on the assessment of the specific national context, in line with the Commission's Vision for Agriculture and Food, which prioritises the long-term sustainability and attractiveness of the EU's farming and agri-food sector. The Member States should also develop a comprehensive ""starter pack"" for young farmers, designed to facilitate the entry and establishment of young farmers in the sector, including a comprehensive package of interventions targeting young farmers.  (7) In line with the objective of achieving a better balance between incentives and requirements, Member States should target support through their NRP Plans towards CAP priorities, which are essential for the long-term sustainability of agriculture. The CAP post-2027 should accelerate the transition towards more sustainable production methods, contributing to climate-neutrality objective by 2050. The new CAP should offer better rewards for delivering more ambitious ecosystem services which go beyond the results achieved through mandatory requirements. The new CAP should strike a new balance between a farm stewardship with a set of mandatory requirements, and agri-environmental and climate actions which support commitments beneficial for the environment, climate and animal welfare and a transition towards more resilient production systems.  (8) The farm stewardship should be established to guarantee compliance of the CAP support with the ""do no significant harm"" principle laid down in Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 of the European Parliament and of the Council 9 . The farm stewardship should comprise minimum environmental and social conditionality requirements, as well as protective practices designed by Member States to deliver on key objectives such as protection of soils and river courses from pollution. Member States should have the flexibility to adapt those protective practices to their specific geographical and climatic context and production systems including by establishing exemptions. To promote socially sustainable agriculture, certain CAP payments require compliance with standards on working and employment conditions, occupational safety and health. The European Charter and diverse national frameworks and labour market models should be respected, no additional obligations should be imposed on social partners or Member States regarding enforcement or controls and double corrections avoided.  (9) Income support for farmers should continue to be the central policy instrument to guarantee a fair income to farmers and sustainable farming and food production. It should contribute to fostering a competitive and resilient agricultural sector pursuing the benefits of high-quality production and resource-efficiency, while ensuring generational renewal and thus long-term food security. Income support allocations should be ringfenced to be used for Income support for farmers only, to provide stability and predictability for the Union agricultural sector. In order to ensure high impact and efficiency, the new CAP should entail a streamlined and consistent toolbox of Income support types of intervention enabling Member States to deliver on the CAP objectives.  (10) Given the need to target the support to those most in need, Member States should pay the area-based degressive income support only to those persons whose principal activity is agriculture, while ensuring that small and pluri-active farmers, who are engaged in at least a minimum level of agricultural activity, are not excluded.  (11) Recognising the need for more farm resilience and risk management, support should be granted to improve the ability of farmers to withstand increasing risks and crises, such as those related to the climate change or market instability, to enable farmers to participate in risk management tools, including support for insurance premiums and contributions to mutual funds in all Member States. A proactive approach to risk management reinforcing the sector's resilience should be promoted by fixing appropriate maximum support rates, with incentives for farmers who implement risk preventive measures.  (12) The CAP objectives should also be pursued through support for investments implemented by farmers and forest holders. Such investments may concern, inter alia, infrastructures related to the development, modernisation or adaptation to climate change of agriculture and forestry, agro-forestry practices, energy and water, installation of digital technologies in agriculture, precision farming, diversification of income sources in other activities such as agro-tourism and bioeconomy. It should also be possible to support investments in the restoration of agricultural or forestry production potential following natural disasters, adverse climatic events or catastrophic events, including fires, storms, floods, pests and diseases.  (13) Recognising the necessity for farmers to balance the professional duties with personal and family responsibilities, it should be possible to provide support for farm relief services facilitating replacement of farmers during leave for sickness, childbearing, holidays or in case of training participation. It should be possible to support establishment of these services as well as wages for temporary workers replacing the farmer.  (14) To foster social, economic, environmental and digital transition in rural areas Member States should ensure that LEADER is supported. It should be possible to grant support under the NRP Plans to quality schemes and promotion activities, short supply chain and local market development.  (15) In line with the need to boost innovation and more sustainable practices, the European Innovation Partnership for agricultural productivity and sustainability (the ‘EIP-AGRI’) should remain a key policy tool, to support interactive innovation, enhancing the exchange of knowledge between actors with a view to spreading solutions ready for practice 10 . Synergies between the CAP and the Union Research Framework Programme (FP10), established by Regulation (EU) …/… of the European Parliament and of the Council, should encourage agriculture to make the best use of research and innovation results, in particular those stemming from projects funded by FP10 and the EIP-AGRI, leading to innovations in the farming and bioeconomy sector and rural areas.  (16) Enhancing interoperability between public agricultural information systems at national level can bring significant benefits, including reduced data collection burden, improved efficiency, and enhanced policy monitoring. In pursuing this aim, Member States should adopt the ""collect once, use multiple times"" principle to reduce reporting burden. Designating a single authority to coordinate interoperability efforts and investing in unique farm IDs, the EU ID Wallet referred to in Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council 11 , and data-sharing infrastructure can reduce administrative burden, streamline reporting obligations, and empower farmers within the data value chain, ultimately supporting the goals of the CAP.  (17) In order to supplement the non-essential elements of this Regulation, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission. In order to ensure legal certainty, power should be delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation with measures ensuring that interoperability and seamless data exchange between information systems used for the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the CAP are implemented by the Member States.  (18) To ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred to the Commission to set out the Roadmap to achieve and maintain interoperability between information systems.  (19) The Commission should be empowered to adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases relating to solving specific problems while ensuring the continuity of income support in the case of extraordinary circumstances, imperative grounds of urgency so require. Moreover, the Commission should be empowered to adopt immediately applicable implementing acts, where in duly justified circumstances, extraordinary circumstances affect the granting of support and jeopardise the effective implementation of the interventions listed in this Regulation.  (20) In order to ensure smooth implementation of the measure envisaged and as a matter of urgency, this Regulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union .  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Article 1 Subject matter  In order to ensure a strong, sustainable and resilient common agricultural policy, Union food security, generational renewal and vibrant rural areas, this Regulation lays down specific conditions for the implementation of the Union support for the common agricultural policy (CAP) in accordance with the general objective laid down in Article 2, point (c), of Regulation (EU) […] [NRP].  This Union support shall be provided under the National and Regional Partnership Fund (the ‘Fund’) in accordance with the rules governing that Fund laid down in Regulation (EU) […] [NRP].  Article 2 CAP national recommendations and steering  1. The Commission shall adopt CAP national recommendations providing guidance to each Member State for the implementation of the CAP-relevant specific objectives set out in Article 3, point (d), of Regulation (EU) […]  [NRP], within their NRP Plans in line with Article 22 of that Regulation in advance of the submission of the NRP Plans by the Member States. The CAP national recommendations shall be based on the following:  (a) contribution to fair and sufficient income for farmers and their long-term competitiveness, including the farmers’ position in the value chain;  (b) improvement of attractiveness of the profession and foster generational renewal;  (c) enhancing climate action, ecosystem services provision, circular solutions, the conservation of biodiversity and natural resources, sustainable farming and improve animal welfare;  (d) improving resilience, farmers’ preparedness and ability to cope with crises and risks;  (e) enhancing the access to knowledge and accelerate innovation and the digital transition for a thriving agri- food sector .  The CAP national recommendations may be updated by the Commission, as appropriate.  2. The Commission shall base the CAP national recommendations on an analysis of the situation of the agricultural sector and rural areas, including demographic factors, structural and territorial characteristics as well as food security in each Member State.  3. In the CAP national recommendations, the Commission shall in particular identify key challenges to be addressed by each Member State in their NRP Plan, on the basis of the CAP-relevant specific objectives set out in Article 3, point (d), of Regulation (EU) […] [NRP].  Article 3 Farm stewardship  1. Farm stewardship shall comprise statutory management requirements listed in Annex I, Part A [ Annex with SMRs ], protective practices defined by Member States in the NRP Plan in accordance with paragraph 4 of this Article and Annex I, Part C, and the social conditionality system which comprises the statutory management requirements listed in Annex I, Part B.  2. Payments under interventions referred to in Article 5(1), points (a) to (f), and points (o) and (p), to the extent they concern support for local agricultural products, shall be subject to compliance with a system of statutory management requirements and protective practices collectively referred to as ‘farm stewardship’.  The list of statutory management requirements and the objectives of protective practices are set out in Annex I.  However, the conditions of farm stewardship listed in Annex I, Parts A and C, shall not apply to farmers receiving support under Article 5(1), point (g).  3. Support subject to the farm stewardship conditions shall be deemed to comply with the principle of ‘do no significant harm’ in accordance with Article 33(2), point (d), of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509.  For the purposes of this Article, ‘statutory management requirement’ means each individual requirement listed in Annex I, Parts A and B, set out within a given legal act listed in Annex I, Parts A and B, differing in substance from any other requirement in the same act.  The legal acts listed in Annex I concerning the statutory management requirements shall apply in the version that is applicable and, in the case of Directives, as implemented by the Member States. Acts implementing directives may however not have the purpose or effect of an exemption of farmers or other beneficiaries from the statutory management requirements listed in Annex I, Parts A and B.  4. Member States shall define in accordance with Annex I, Part C, at a national or regional level, protective practices to be respected by farmers and other beneficiaries receiving the support referred to in paragraph 2, to achieve the following objectives:  (a) protection of carbon-rich soils, landscape features and permanent grasslands on agricultural area;  (b) protection of soil against erosion, preservation of the soil potential, maintenance of soil organic matter, including through crop rotation or diversification, as well as protection against burning of stubble on arable land;  (c) protection of water courses and ground water against pollution and runoff.  5. Member States shall include in the NRP Plan a description of the protective practices defined for each of the objectives set out in paragraph 4 including their territorial scope, farmers and other beneficiaries subject to the practice and a summary of the protective practice. In setting the protective practices, Member States shall take utmost account of the CAP national recommendations referred to in Article 2. Member States shall adapt the protective practices to different land management systems and different environmental and climatic conditions in their territory.  6.

The proposal seeks to provide targeted income support to farmers, ensuring their competitiveness while contributing to food security and environmental preservation. It emphasizes directing support to farmers who actively contribute to these goals and encourages them to diversify their income sources.

To make farming more attractive, particularly to younger generations, the proposal promotes skills development, better access to capital, and improved working conditions. It introduces a performance-based and market-oriented approach, reducing bureaucratic burdens and rewarding environmentally friendly practices. The proposal also stresses the need for a stable and predictable policy framework to help farmers tackle environmental and climate challenges, with Member States taking greater responsibility for meeting policy objectives through incentives rather than mandatory conditions.

The proposal includes measures to differentiate payments, targeting support at farmers most in need, such as young and new farmers, women, family or small farmers, and those in areas with natural or other specific constraints. It introduces a degressive payment system, where higher income farmers receive reduced support, and sets a cap on the total amount of area-based income support per farmer. Additionally, the proposal ensures that support is primarily directed towards farmers actively contributing to food security and allows for the inclusion of small farmers and those with natural constraints in the eligible hectare calculations.

For livestock sectors, the proposal introduces a coefficient system to adjust",

EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulations (EU) No 1308/2013, (EU) 2021/2115 and (EU) No 251/2014 as regards certain market rules and sectoral support measures in the wine sector and for aromatised wine products  EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM  1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  While the Union remains the global leader in wine production, consumption, and exported value, societal and demographic changes are impacting the amount, quality, and types of wine consumed. Wine consumption in the Union has been steadily declining and is at its lowest level of the past three decades, while traditional export markets for Union wines are impacted by a combination of de-consumption and geopolitical factors, leading to more uncertain export patterns.  In addition, production is becoming unpredictable, given the wine sector’s vulnerability to climate change. With the resulting oversupply putting pressure on prices, winegrowers have less income to invest in their business and low financial reserves they can fall back on if one of the more frequent and often localised severe weather events hits their region.  The High-Level Group on Wine Policy (HLG) was established to discuss the se challenges and identify possible opportunities for the Union wine sector. The HLG was made up of Directors-General of the agricultural ministries of Union Member States and , during the first meeting, representatives of the major stakeholder organisations were also invited to present their analysis of the situation. The discussions centred around how to better support the sector in view of the current structural challenges by managing the production potential, enhancing competitiveness and exploring new market opportunities. After four meetings, the Group endorsed a document with policy recommendations 1 in December 2024. The recommendations were broadly welcomed by stakeholders and by MEPs in the meeting of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development ( COMAGRI ) of 13 January 2025.  In view of the positive reaction to the HLG recommendations, it is now expected that the most urgent and sector specific recommendations would be translated into legislative proposals as soon as possible to help the wine sector to face the serious challenges and to become more competitive. If the Commission does not act quickly, the situation will deteriorate further, with irreversible consequences for many rural areas in terms of abandoned vineyards and the loss of growth and employment opportunities.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 establishing a common organisation of the markets in agricultural products lays down provisions for the scheme of authorisations for vine plantings, which will be amended by this proposal in line with the recommendations of the HLG on the management of the production potential, making it easier for Member States to address or prevent risk of surplus production capacity in certain areas and market segments. This proposed regulation also amends the current rules on labelling to facilitate the production of wine products with a lower alcohol content and to allow for new ways to inform consumers about the characteristics of the wine they buy.  Regulation (EU) No 251/2014 on the definition, description, presentation, labelling and the protection of geographical indications of aromatised wine products is also amended to take the amendments to Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 concerning wines with a lower alcohol content into account in order to allow the production of aromatised wine products based on such wines with a lower alcohol content. To ensure that consumers are correctly informed of the nature of aromatised wine products with a lower alcoholic content, the labelling rules are also amended in line with the ones for grapevine products.  Regulation (EU) 2021/2115 establishing rules on support for strategic plans is amended by this proposal to give Member States the possibility to combine the efficient restructuring of vineyards with the need to avoid an increase of production, as recommended by the HLG. Furthermore, producer groups managing protected designations of origin and geographical indications will be able to benefit from support for developing wine tourism in their region and the maximum duration of the support for promotion and communication operations carried out in third countries will be extended. To strengthen cooperation in the wine sector, certain investments carried out by producer organisations will benefit from the maximum rate of Union financial assistance. To support producers in respect of climate change mitigation and adaptation, Member States will be given the possibility to increase the maximum Union financial assistance that can be provided for investments pursuing such objective.  The proposed policy measures should be implemented within a coherent national strategic framework to maximise their effectiveness. Member States must evaluate their impact to ensure efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and long-term benefits. Key priorities include avoiding market imbalances, preserving landscapes, sustaining rural employment, and enhancing the competitiveness of vine growers and wine producers.  • Consistency with other Union policies  By facilitating the production of wine products and aromatised wine products with a lower alcohol content, this proposal provides consumers the opportunity to reduce their alcohol intake while still enjoying wine. Giving producer groups managing protected designations of origin and geographical indications access to support for developing wine tourism in their region is in line with the aim to create opportunities for employment and growth in rural areas  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 42 and Article 43(2) thereof.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  The provisions that need to be amended to implement the recommendations of the HLG are laid down in Regulations of European Parliament and of the Council, therefore Member States cannot implement those recommendations if the Union legislation is not amended accordingly. In line with the principle of subsidiarity, several provisions of this proposal provide national authorities with wider leeway to manage the production potential more attuned to the specific situation of the wine producing regions.  • Proportionality  The policy choices of the proposal are based on the recommendations of the HLG, which represent an unanimously endorsed compromise reached after four rounds of discussions o n different policy options and are supported by all Member States. T he HLG discussions were informed by an in-depth analysis conducted by experts from the Wine Market Observatory 2 . These experts dedicated three special sessions , spanning from December 2023 to the second quarter of 2024, to assessing the state of the wine market, exploring different policy options to address current challenges and help the sector seize potential future opportunities. This proposal remains with in the limit of what is necessary to achieve the objectives already pursue d by the amended existing rules .  • Choice of the instrument  The rules that need to be amended to implement the recommendations of the HLG are laid down in three Regulations of the European Parliament and of the Council. Therefore, the chosen instrument must also be a Regulation of European Parliament and of the Council.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  Not applicable  • Stakeholder consultations  Given the urgency to adopt the initiative, no call for evidence or public consultation is planned.  • Collection and use of expertise  The HLG recommendations were the result of a wide and in-depth discussion and analysis starting already prior to the setting-up of the HLG, at first with the wine experts in the Market Observatory and stakeholders and then in the framework of the HLG with the Directors-General of the agricultural ministries of all Member States. Key stakeholders were also invited to one of the meetings of the HLG to present their views. The legal proposal is based on the HLG recommendations which were endorsed at unanimity by Member States and are supported by stakeholders and welcomed by COMAGRI.  • Impact assessment  Given the urgency to adopt the initiative, no impact assessment will be carried out. The costs and benefits of the initiative will be assessed in a Staff Working Document to be published within 3 months of its adoption.  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  This proposal aims to minimize compliance costs for SMEs above the already existing possibility to provide the list of ingredients and the nutrition declaration by electronic means, simplifying trade between Union Member States. Currently, the identification on the package or on a label attached thereto of the link (e.g. a QR-code) to the electronic means containing the list of ingredients and nutrition declaration through words (e.g. “ingredients” and/or “nutrition declaration”) is cumbersome for wine producers, and rules for the identification differ among Member States. With the proposed Regulation, the Commission will be empowered to develop, in cooperation with Member States, rules for a common approach to such identification, which will reduce costs and administrative burden especially for small producers who will be able to sell their wines in different countries with the same label. The sales denominations of the wines with a reduced alcohol content are also harmonised across the Union and will be made clearer by using terms more familiar to consumers.  • Fundamental rights  The proposal respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised, in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  This proposal has no quantifiable budgetary implications. Any changes in the Union financial assistance for the interventions under the strategic plan are made within the framework of the national financial envelopes.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  In view of the crisis the Union wine sector is currently facing, the measure should enter into force as soon as possible, except for the new labelling rules, which need to apply later to give producers time to adapt and allow for the sale of products labelled according to the previously applicable rules until the stock is exhausted.  The wine market observatory is continuously monitoring the supply and demand of different types of wine on the Union market and it will provide an insight on the developments of the market segment of low-alcohol wines, the development of which this proposed regulation aims to support. The effects of the changes to the scheme of authorisations for vine plantings will be monitored in the framework of the obligatory annual communications submitted by Member States on the implementation of the scheme.  • Explanatory documents (for directives)  Not applicable  • Detailed ex p lanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  If a vineyard is grubbed up, the vine grower can request a replanting authorisation which is valid for three years (6 years if the replanting takes place on the same parcel of land). The HLG recommended a longer validity of 8 years for all replanting authorisations to give, in this uncertain situation, vine growers more time to explore the possibility to plant varieties which are better adapted to market demand or the changing climatic conditions or to use new vineyard management techniques.  Furthermore, to alleviate pressure on winegrowers, the administrative penalties applied when a replanting authorisation is not used during its validity period, should be abolished. On the contrary, the HLG agreed to maintain the administrative penalty applied if new planting authorisations remain unused in order to discourage speculative applications from growers who do not have the intention to plant a vineyard. However, in view of the current decline in demand for wine, winegrowers who hold still valid, unused authorisations for new plantings granted to them before 1 January 2025 should be allowed to renounce, by a certain date, these authorisations without incurring an administrative penalty to remove the incentive to plant vineyards where there might be no demand for the wine they will produce.  Member States already have the possibility to set regional limits for new planting authorisations, for specific areas eligible for the production of wines with a protected designation of origin, for areas eligible for the production of wines with a protected geographical indication, or for areas without a geographical indication. They should also be given the possibility to limit the issuing of new planting authorisations at regional level for specific areas with excess supply where national or Union measures aimed to reduce the supply, such as distillation, green harvesting or grubbing up of vineyards, are or have been implemented in order to avoid further increasing the production potential of regions where supply already outstrips demand.  However, where a Member State decides to set regional limits for specific areas to avoid an excessive growth of the production potential, the Member State should also be authorised to request that the authorisations granted for the area concerned by the limit are used in that area because otherwise there is a risk that newcomers are totally excluded, which would discourage new entrants and young farmers.  While the replanting of a grubbed-up vineyard does not increase the vineyard area as a whole, Member States should be given the possibility to set rules for the replanting in order to better manage the territorial distribution of vineyards. Replanting authorisations may be used on the same holding on which the grubbing up was undertaken. Given that holdings can contain vineyards in different regions, Member States should be able to avoid the relocation of vineyards between regions when maintaining viticulture in the initial geographical region is important for socio-economic or environmental reasons, for instance for preserving vineyards on slopes and terraces or preserving landscape and avoid soil erosion. Member States should also be given the possibility to set special conditions for replanting authorisations to encourage the use of varieties and production methods that do not increase average yields.  In a context of diminishing consumption, monitoring the overall production potential is very important for the future balance of the market. The application of the planting authorisation scheme has this objective and should apply in all wine-producing Member States when a certain vineyard area is reached.  In recent years there has been an ever-evolving consumer demand for grapevine products with a reduced alcohol content. For such products, consumers are familiar with terms such as zero-alcohol, alcohol-free and low alcohol, which are however regulated differently in various Member States. Indeed, in absence of specific Union rules regarding nutrition claims referring to low alcohol levels, or the reduction or absence of alcohol or energy in beverages which normally contain alcohol, relevant national rules may apply in accordance with Article 4(4) of the Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 on nutrition and health claims made on foods (Claims Regulation). There is therefore a need to harmonise the use of these terms and to define the alcohol content linked to each of them across the EU. This should also be reflected in the rules on labelling of wine products in order to better inform the consumer of the characteristics and production methods of grapevine products with a reduced alcohol content, allowing the Union wine sector to benefit from this development in consumer demand while maintaining high quality production standards.  High consumer demand for sparkling wine products with a lower alcohol content or without alcohol represents an opportunity for the sector, but technological limitations exist for their production with the current production rules on de-alcoholisation. According to the rules currently in force, wine products must have reached the characteristics and the minimum actual alcoholic strength of the category before undergoing the de-alcoholisation process. The de-alcoholisation process removes the CO2 from sparkling wines. Therefore, it should be allowed to produce sparkling and aerated wines from de-alcoholised or partially de-alcoholised still wines through second fermentation or the addition of CO2, under the condition that they are labelled in a way that does not mislead the consumer.  The possibility to provide the list of ingredients and the nutrition declaration by electronic means has proven an effective means for operators for providing information to consumers while facilitating the functioning of the internal market and wine exports, especially for small producers. However, the absence of harmonised rules on the identification of the electronic means on the physical label and the consequent diverging solutions applied by the Member States have caused fragmentation of the single market affecting the proper marketing of wines across the Union. The Commission should thus be empowered to develop, in cooperation with Member States, rules for the identification of the electronic means providing information to consumers, in particular through a language-free system, in order to minimise costs and administrative burden for operators, and to ensure a common approach across the Union market, while taking into account the need to make information accessible to consumers. This draft regulation empowers the Commission also to adapt the electronic labelling rules to new needs arising from the fast and constant progress of digitalisation and the increasing amount of information that should be made accessible to consumers.  Member States have the possibility to adopt marketing rules to regulate the supply in the wine sector to improve and stabilise the operation of the common wine market. In the current context of a structural consumption decrease and recurrent situations of oversupply in certain regions and market segments, it is appropriate to clarify that such rules can include the setting of maximum grape yields and the management of wine stocks. Moreover, producer organisations can play an important role in strengthening winegrowers’ position in the food supply chain and adapting supply to market trends. Therefore, Member States should also be able to adopt marketing rules in the wine sector taking into account proposals adopted by recognised producer organisations or by recognised interbranch organisations, when they are representative in the economic area concerned.  In case of market imbalances, Member States are currently authorised to make national payments to wine producers for the voluntary or mandatory distillation of wine. This proposal aims to authorise national payments for voluntary green harvesting and voluntary grubbing up of productive vineyards as additional supply management tools, given the cost-effectiveness to remove surplus wine from the market before it is produced. Limits are set for the overall amount of national payments authorised in a Member State in any given year for distillation and green harvesting to avoid a distortion of competition. For grubbing up, given the structural nature of the measure and its higher costs, the limit for national payments will be set case by case on the basis of the specific market circumstances of the Member State and the wine regions in which it would be implemented.  Aromatised wine products are another important outlet for grapevine products. However, the current legislation does not allow to use the sales denominations reserved for aromatised wine products for beverages which do not reach the minimum alcohol content for each product category. In view of the increasing consumer demand for innovative alcoholic beverages with a lower actual alcoholic strength by volume, it should be allowed to obtain aromatised wine products from de-alcoholised or partially de-alcoholised wines. In order to ensure that consumers are correctly informed of the nature of aromatised wine products with a lower alcoholic content, it is appropriate to lay down rules for the labelling of de-alcoholised or partially de-alcoholised wines, so that those aromatised wine products may use the same descriptive terms in their presentation and labelling as the grapevine products with the corresponding alcoholic strength. To improve the clarity of the information to consumers, the provisions concerning the labelling of the nutrition declaration and the list of ingredients of aromatised wine products by electronic means should be aligned to those applied to grapevine products.  In order to meet new consumer demand and the need for product innovation, the requirements for the aromatised wine product category ‘Glühwein’ are amended to allow the use of rosé wine. At the same time, provisions are made to forbid the use of the term ‘rosé’ in the labelling of a ‘Glühwein’ produced by combining red and white wine or any of those with rosé wine. A labelling derogation is introduced to allow alcoholic beverages produced with the same requirements as those laid down for ‘Glühwein’, but by using fruit wine instead of grapevine products as main ingredient, to use the sales denomination ‘Glühwein’ in their presentation and labelling to meet consumer demand for such products.  In the framework of the CAP Strategic Plans, the restructuring and conversion of vineyards can be supported. In order to strike a balance between the need for Member States to ensure efficient restructuring of vineyards and the need to avoid an increase of production that may lead to oversupply, Member States will be allowed to set conditions for the implementation of the restructuring and conversion type of interventions with the aim to avoid an increase in yield and thus an increase of production for the vineyard subject to this type of interventions.  With a view to developing wine tourism in wine regions with protected designations and protected geographical indications, producer groups managing protected designations of origin and geographical indications can now be beneficiaries of the type of interventions promoting wine tourism in production regions.  Stakeholders and Member States have repeatedly stated that the current maximum duration of three years for the support granted for promotion and communication operations carried out in third countries in relation to consolidation of market outlets is too short to achieve this aim. The maximum duration is therefore extended from three to five years.  To provide an additional incentive for cooperation in the wine sector, certain investments carried out by recognised producer organisations will benefit from the same maximum rate of Union financial assistance as it is currently already the case for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises.  With a view to further supporting producers in respect of climate change mitigation and adaptation, Member States are given the choice to increase the maximum Union financial assistance that can be provided for investments pursuing such objective to up to 80% of the eligible investment costs.  In order to clarify the conditions applicable to Union financial assistance for investments in innovation, it is explicitly stated that no such Union financial assistance is to be granted to enterprises in difficulty within the meaning of the Commission Communication entitled ‘Guidelines on State aid for rescuing and restructuring non-financial undertakings in difficulty’.  2025/0071 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulations (EU) No 1308/2013, (EU) 2021/2115 and (EU) No 251/2014 as regards certain market rules and sectoral support measures in the wine sector and for aromatised wine products  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 42, first subparagraph, and Article 43(2) thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 3 ,  Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions 4 ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) While the U nion remains the global leader in wine production, consumption, and exported value, societal and demographic changes are impacting the amount, quality, and types of wine consumed. Wine consumption in the Union is at its lowest level of the past three decades while tr aditional export markets for Union wines are impacted by a combination of de creasing consumption trends and geopolitical factors, leading to more uncertain ex port patterns. In addition, production is becoming unpredictable, given the wine sector’s vulnerability to climate change. With the resulting oversupply that lead s to a decreas e in prices , winegrowers have less income to invest in their business and low financial reserves they can fall back on , if one of the more frequent and often localised sever e weather events hits their region.  (2) T he High-Level Group on Wine Policy ( ‘ HLG ’ ) was established to discuss the se challenges and to identify possible opportunities for the Union wine sector. It reflected on how to better support the sector in facing current structural challenges by managing the production potential, enhancing competitiveness and exploring new market opportunities. After four meetings, the HLG endorsed a document with policy recommendations 5 .  (3) In order to provide the best possible support to wine producer s facing the above challenges , i t is appropriate to reflect the most urgent recommendations of the HLG in the legal framework applicable to wines and aromatised wine products.  (4) In view of the current d ecline in demand for wine, w inegrowers who hold valid unused authorisations for new plantings and authorisations resulting from the conversion of planting rights granted to them before 1 January 2025 should be allowed to waive these authorisations without incurring an administrative penalty , with a view to remov ing the incentive for planting authorisation holders to plant vineyards where there might be no demand for the wine they will produce. For the new planting authorisation s granted after that date , the administrative penalty should continue to apply in case of non - u se of these authorisations in order to discourage speculative applications from wine growers who do not have the intention to plant a vineyard .  (5) Concerning the management of the production potential, a longer validity period of replanting authorisations should be foreseen to give producers more time to explore the possibility to plant varieties which are better adapted to the market demand or to the changing climatic conditions or to use new vineyard management techniques. Furthermore, to alleviate pressure on winegrowers, they should not face administrative penalties if they decide not to use a replanting authorisation.  (6) Member States should be given the possibility to limit the issuing of new planting authorisations at regional level for specific areas with excess supply where national or Union measures aimed to reduce the supply (i.e. distillation, green harvesting or grubbing up of vineyards ) are or have been implemented in order to avoid further increasing the production potential .  (7) Where a Member State decides to set regional limits for specific area s to avoid an excessive growth of the production potential , it is appropriate to allow that Member State s require that the authorisations gra n ted for the area concerned by the regional limit are used in that area . In order to better take into account recent trends in the wine sector, Member States should have the flexibility to set regional limits for specific areas as low as 0% , in view to adapting the production potential to the market demand.  (8) While the replanting of a grubbed-up vineyard does not increase the vineyard area, Member States should be given the possibility to set rules for replanting in order to better manage the territorial distribution of vineyards , for instance to avoid the relocation of vineyards to regions with a market imbalance or away from slopes and terraces, where they play an important role in the preservation of the landscape and avoid soil erosion. Member States should also be given the possibility to set conditions on the use of varieties and production methods to avoid an increase in yields and to ensure preservation of traditional grape varieties and production methods .  (9) In order to ensure a proportionate approach to the application of the planting authorisations sc h eme while taking into consideration the serious risks that oversupply represents to the market, it is appropriate to establish a maximum threshold of hectares of planted vineyards under which Member States are exempted from the obligation to apply the s cheme of planting authorisations.  (10) In recent years , there has been a n ever-evolving consumer demand for g rapevine products with a reduced alcohol content , which are at present produced by de-alcoholisat i on by using certain techniques allowed in the Union . C onsumers are familiar with t erms such as ’ 0,0% ’ , ‘ alcohol-free ’ and ’ alcohol- light’ , which are widely used but regulated differently in various Member States . It is therefore necessary to harmonise the use of these terms across the Union. The rules on the labelling of wine products should therefore be amended in order to better inform the consumer of the characteristics of grapevine products with a reduced alcohol content, while keeping the obligation to provide information on the production method consisting of a de-alcoholisation . This should allow the Union wine sector to benefit from this development in consumer demand while maintaining high quality production standards .  (11) High c onsumer demand for sparkling wine products with a lower alcohol content or without alcohol represents an opportunity for the sector . However, the current rules for the production of de-alcoholised wines impose certain technological limitations for the production of such wines . According to the rules currently in force , wine products must have reached the characteristics and the min imum alcoholic strength of the corresponding category before undergoing the de-alcoholisation process , which implies that de-alcoholised sparkling wines can be produced only from sparkling wines . However, the de-alcoholisation process removes entirely any CO2 from the initial sparkling wine . Consequently, in order to produce a sparkling wine with lower or no alcoholic content, it is necessary to reintroduce CO2 in the partially or totally de-alcoholised wine that has lost its initial CO2 content, th r ough a new , separate process . Therefore, it should be allowed to produce de-alcoholised sparkling and aerated sparkling wines directly from de-alcoholised or partially de-alcoholi s ed still wines through a second fermentation or the addition of CO2 , respectively .  (12) The possibility to provide the list of ingredients and the nutrition declaration of wine products by electronic means has proven effective for operators for presenting important information to consumers , whi le facilitat ing the functioning of the internal market and wine exports , especially for small producers. However, the absence of harmonised rules on the identification , on the package or the label attached thereto , of the electronic means providing the list of ingredients and /or the nutrition declaration , is causing di verging prac t ices by operators and different rules by national authorities , affect ing the proper market ing of wines . In order to minimise costs and the administrative burden for operators, and to ensure a common approach across the Union market, while taking into account the need to make such information accessible to consumers, t he Commission should be empowered to develop, in cooperation with Member States, rules on the identification on the package or the label attached thereto of the electronic means providing consumers with the list o f ingredients and the nutrition declaration in a harmonised way, including through a language-free system .  (13) The Commission should be empowered to adapt the rules on electronic labelling to new needs arising from the fast and constant progress of digitalisati o n and to accommodate other compulsory or relevant information to consumers that may be presented electronically .  (14) Member States have the possibility to adopt marketing rules to regulate the supply in the wine sector to improve and stabilise the operation of the common wine market. In the current context of structural consumption decrease and recurrent situations of oversupply in certain regions and market segments, it is appropriate to clarify that such rules can include the setting of maximum grape yields and the management of wine stocks. Moreover, producer organisations can play an important role in strengthening the winegrowers’ position in the food supply and in adapting supply to market trends. Therefore, Member States should also be able to adopt marketing rules in the wine sector taking into account proposals adopted by recognised producer organisations or by recognised interbranch organisations, when they are representative in the concerned economic area or areas .  (15) Member States may currently be authorised to make national payments to wine producers for the voluntary or mandatory distillation of wine . Given the cost-effectiveness of removing surplus production from the market before wine is produced, it is appropriate to also provide for the possibility to authorise Member States , in justified cases of crisis, to make national payments for voluntary green harvesting and voluntary grubbing up of productive vineyards . This Regulation should set l imits for the overall amount of national payments authorised in a Member State in any given year for distillation and green harvesting to avoid a distortion of competition. For grubbing up, given the structural nature of the measure and its higher costs, it is not appropriate to set an overall maximum amount of national payments. However, Member States should justify in their notification the limit for national payments case by case on the basis of the ir specific market circumstances and those of the wine regions in which the measure would be implemented .  (16) Aromatised wine products are a natural outlet for grapevine products. However, Regulation (EU) No 251/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council 6 does not allow to use the sales denominations reserved for aromatised wine products for beverages which do not reach the minimum alcohol content laid dow n in that Regulation for each product category. In view of the increasing consumer demand for innovative alcoholic beverages with a lower actual alcoholic strength by volume, it should be allowed t o place on the market beverages obtain ed from de-alcoholised or partially de-alcoholised wines produced in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council 7 bearing in their presentation and labelling sales denominations reserved for aromatised wine products .  (17) In order to ensure that consumers are correctly informed of the nature of aromatised wine products with a lower alcoholic content, it is appropriate to lay down rules in line with those laid down in Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 for the labelling of de-alcoholised or partially de-alcoholised wines , so that aromatised wine products obtained from de-alcoholised or partially de-alcoholised wines are described in their presentation and labelling by the same terms as grapevine products with the corresponding alcoholic strength.  (18) T he issues highlighted above for grapevine products in relation to the identification of the electronic means containing the nutrition declaration and the list of ingredients are valid also for aromatised wine products . T herefore, t he Commission should be empowered to develop, in cooperation with Member States, rules on the identification on the package or the label attached thereto of the electronic means for aromatised wine products . T o ensure simplicity and clarity, these rules should be the same as those applied to grapevine products .  (19) In order to meet new consumer demand s and the need for product innovation, rules on the production and labelling of the aromatised wine product category ‘ Glühwein ’ should be amended to allow for the use of rosé wine. At the same time, the use of the term ‘rosé’ in the presentation and labelling of a Glühwein produced by combining red and white wine or any of those with rosé wine should be prohibited . For the same reasons, it is also appropriate to lay down a derogation allowing alcoholic beverages produced with the same requirements as those laid down for Glühwein but by using as main ingredient fruit wine instead of grapevine products to use the sales denomination Glühwein in its presentation and labelling.  (20) With a view to developing wine tourism in wine regions with protected designations and protected geographical indications, it is appropriate to allow for producer groups managing protected designations of origin and geographical indications in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2024/1143 of the European Parliament and of the Council 8 to be beneficiaries of the type of interventions referred to in Article 58(1), first subparagraph, point (i), of Regulation (EU) 2021/2115 of the European Parliament and of the Council 9 .  (21) In order to strike a balance between the need for Member States to ensure efficient restructuring of vineyards and the need to avoid an increase in production that may lead to oversupply , Member States should be allowed to set up conditions for the implementation of the restructuring and conversion of vineyards as referred to in Article 58(1) , first subparagraph, point (a) , of Regulation (EU) 2021/2115 . These condition s should aim at avoiding an increase in yield and thus an increase in production for the vineyard s subject to th is type of intervention s .  (22) To adapt to market trends and harness efficient market opportunities, the maximum duration of the support for promotion and communication operations carri e d out in third countries in relation to the consolidation of market outlets should be extended from three to five years.  (23) To strengthen cooperation in the wine sector, investments referred to in Article 58(1), first sub paragraph, point (b) , of Regulation (EU) 2021/2115 ca rried out by producer organisations recognised under Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 should benefit from the maximum rate of Union financ ial assistance set out in Article 59(2) of Regulation (EU) 2021/2115 as it is already the case for micro, small and medium - sized enterprises withi n the meaning of Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC 10 .  (24) T o further support pro du cers in respect of climate change mitigation and adaptation, it is pertinent to provide for the possi bility for Member States to increase the maximum Union financial assistance for invest ments pursuing that objective to up to 80% of the eligible investment costs .  (25) Moreover, it is necessary to clarify that the Union financial assistance for innovation referred to in Article 58(1), first subparagraph, point (e), of Regulation (EU) 2021/2115 should n o t be granted to enterprises in difficulty within the meaning of the Commission Communication ‘Guidelines on State aid for rescuing and restructuring non-financial undertakings in difficulty’ as it is the case for Union financial assistance for investments referred to in Article 58(1), first subparagraph, point (b ) , of that Regulation .  (26) Regulations (EU) No 1308/2013, (EU) No 251/2014 and (EU) 2021/2115 should therefore be amended accordingly .  (27) In order to allow time to producers to adapt to the new requirements concerning the designation of grapevine products with a low alcoholic content, those new requirements should start to apply 18 months from the date of entry into force of this R egulation. It is also appropriate to provide transitional rules to allow grapevine product s labelled prior to the application of the new requirements to continue to be placed on the market until stocks are exhausted .  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Article 1 Amendments to Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013  Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 is amended as follows:  (1) Article 62(3) is replaced by the following:  ‘3. The authorisations referred to in paragraph 1, granted in accordance with Articles 64 and 68, shall be valid for three years from the date on which they were granted. A producer who has not used an authorisation granted in accordance with Articles 64 and 68 during its period of validity shall be subject to administrative penalties as provided for in Article 90a(4).  By way of derogation from the first subparagraph, producers who hold valid authorisations in accordance with Articles 64 and 68 granted before 1 January 2025 shall not be subject to the administrative penalty referred to in Article 90a(4) provided that they inform the competent authorities before the date of expiry of the authorisation and at the latest by 31 December 2026 that they do not intend to make use of their authorisation.  Authorisations granted in accordance with Article 66 on replantings shall be valid for eight years from the date on which they were granted. Producers who have not used an authorisation granted in accordance with Article 66 during its period of validity shall not be subject to the administrative penalty referred to in Article 90a(4).’  (2) Article 63 is amended as follows:  (a) paragraph 2 is replaced by the following:  ‘2.

FRAMEWORK OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE  1.1. Title of the proposal/initiative  Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL amending Regulations (EU) No 1308/2013, (EU) 2021/2115 and (EU) No 251/2014 as regards certain market rules and sectoral support measures in the wine sector and for aromatised wine products.  1.2. Policy area(s) concerned  Programme cluster 8 - Agriculture & Maritime Policy under Heading 3 of the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) 2021-2027.  1.3. Objective(s)  1.3.1. General objective(s)  In order to address structural challenges faced by the European wine sector, the objective of the proposal is to enhance the sector’s competitiveness and resilience, preserve the economic importance of the EU wine sector and its social relevance, particularly helping maintain the vitality of many rural areas.  1.3.2. Specific objective(s)  The proposal aims at providing long-lasting policy tools to support Member States and the wine sector to achieve the following specific objectives:  1) Address the management of the production potential.  2) Increase the resilience of the EU wine sector against climate change and tensions of shifting markets  3) Adapt the sector to market trends and help it harness new market opportunities  1.3.3. Expected result(s) and impact  The main expected results are:  – The EU wine sector continues to lead globally the wine market  – The balance between the wine production potential and the trends in demand from the domestic and international markets is re-established.  – Member States are able to adopt measures to address challenges and difficulties with enhanced flexibility.  – Farmers and producer organisations benefit for a more flexible policy framework for taking decisions aligned with the market trends.  – The EU wine sector improves its capacity to improve its position in emerging and new markets, and to diversify sources of income.  – The EU wine sector is able to better confront the uncertainties affecting the market, including climate change.  1.3.4. Indicators of performance  The proposal does not affect the CAP monitoring framework.  1.4. The proposal/initiative relates to:   a new action   a new action following a pilot project / preparatory action 11   the extension of an existing action   a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action  1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative  1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative  The current proposal responds to the most urgent and specific recommendations endorsed by the High Level Group (HLG) on wine policy in December 2024, by amending the existing legal framework to the extent necessary to contribute to achieve the defined objectives. The proposal, once adopted, will allow Member States and the wine sector take action quickly, bringing relief to the many challenges confronted.  The modifications proposed might be further supplemented in future policy reforms, to give response to some additional recommendations that are not sector specific or cannot be implemented within the current context.  1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, greater effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this section 'added value of EU involvement' is the value resulting from EU action, that is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.  The cross-border and global nature of key challenges faced by the EU wine sector and the wide regulatory framework the wine is subject to in the EU require a common response at the EU level, securing the functioning of the single market and the level playing field established by the CAP.  1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past  N/A  1.5.4. Compatibility with the multiannual financial framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments  The proposal does not affect the multiannual financial framework and does not change the current CAP budget or the distribution of budget between the two pillars, or the design of measures under the two pillars.  1.5.5. Assessment of the different available financing options, including scope for redeployment  Any CAP related expenditure will remain within the enevelopes of the National Support Programmes for the wine sector. Other measures may be financed with national funds.  1.6.

Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities  No changes are foreseen with respect to the status quo.  3. ESTIMATED FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE  3.1. Heading(s) of the multiannual financial framework and expenditure budget line(s) affected  This proposal does not have any quantifiable budgetary impact.  In line with the recommendations of the HLG on wine, the proposal includes measures aiming at managing the production potential, enhancing competitiveness and exploring new market opportunities of the sector.  Some measures (listed under Point 5 Detailed explanation of the specific provision of the proposal) may accelerate the implementation and consequently increase the expenditure of the wine budget, but any related expenditure will remain under the Member States financial allocations for the wine sector.  The proposal contains provisions giving Member States a degree of flexibility to increase the Union financial assistance for certain types of interventions and beneficiaries, in the framework of the CAP Strategic Plans. Thus, producer groups managing protected designations of origin and geographical indications can now be beneficiaries of the type of interventions promoting wine tourism in production regions. The maximum duration of the support for promotion and communication operations carried out in third countries is extended from three to five years. Certain investments carried out by recognised producer organisations will benefit from the same maximum rate of support as it is already the case for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises. Member States may increase the support rate for investments on climate change mitigation and adaptation.  The impact of the flexibilities introduced in the policy framework cannot be quantified at this stage.  – Existing budget lines  In order of multiannual financial framework headings and budget lines.

Data  Table: Row 1 — The proposed provisions provide: a) an empowerment to the Commission to issue rules supplementing existing rules on electronic labelling of certain mandatory information from operators to consumers in the wine sector (article 1(6)). Personal data protection is already considered in the regulation in force and is not under the scope of this regulation; b) the alignment of the provisions concerning the electronic labelling of the nutrition declaration and the list of ingredients of aromatised wine products to those applied to grapevine products (article 2(3)). Alignment with the European Data Strategy In line with the EU strategy for data, the delegated power for electronic labelling of grapevine and wine products will harmonise terms and rules on the identification of information by electronic means to consumers, which will ensure a common approach across the Union market. Ultimately, such approach will allow labels to flow within the EU for the benefit of citizens and consumers. The specific elements concerning the alignment with the European Data Strategy should be assessed case by case whenever the empowerment would be used. Alignment with the once-only principle Not applicable. Public administrations are not concerned. Data flows Not applicable.  4.3. Digital solutions  Table: Row 1 — Digital solution : provision of empowerment concerning mandatory labelling information presented by electronic means. Ref. to requirements: Article 1(6) The Commission may develop delegated acts to establish a common identification on the package or the label of grapevine products of the electronic means that provide mandatory information to consumers, as well as to adapt the rules on electronic labelling to future technological progress if needed (e.g. increased requirements on provision of electronic information between operators or from operators to consumers). New rules would thus improve accessibility and understandability of digital labels across the EU, reducing the costs for operators and increasing clarity for consumers. Body responsible: European Commission (for the empowerment); the economic operators (for implementation). Digital solution : provision allowing the labelling of mandatory information by electronic means. Ref. to requirements: Article 2(3) The rules on identification of the electronic means for aromatised wine products would be aligned with those of the wine sector, with a single system across sectors. Main mandated rules in force for wine that would be mirrored: operators can provide certain mandatory information (list of ingredients, nutrition declaration) on the physical label or by electronic means identified on the package or on a label attached thereto. The system must avoid any collection or tracking of user data and must not provide information aimed at marketing purposes. Body responsible: the economic operator. At present, the policy initiative does not foresee the use of AI technologies for the identified digital solution.  4.4. Interoperability assessment  Table: Row 1 — The requirements set by the policy initiative do not concern digital public services.  4.5. Measures to support digital implementation  Table: Row 1 — Article 1(6): The Commission shall adopt delegated acts, when it will be deemed necessary (not within a specific timeline). Member States shall be involved. Article 2(3): the provision simply extends to aromatised wines the rules on electronic labelling applied to wine. Member States shall be involved. Operators shall implement the rules.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"The European Commission has proposed a legislative amendment aimed at revitalizing the European wine sector, which is grappling with challenges such as declining consumption, climate change impacts, and uncertain export markets. The proposal seeks to amend existing regulations to better manage wine production, enhance competitiveness, and explore new market opportunities. Key changes include allowing Member States to manage vine planting authorizations more effectively to prevent surplus production, introducing new labeling rules for wines with lower alcohol content, and providing flexibility for vineyard restructuring to prevent market imbalances.

To support producers in adapting to climate change, the proposal allows Member States to increase financial assistance for investments in climate change mitigation and adaptation to up to 80% of eligible costs, excluding enterprises in financial difficulty. It also extends the validity of replanting authorizations to eight years, abolishes administrative penalties for unused replanting authorizations, and allows winegrowers to renounce unused authorizations granted before January 1, 2025, without penalty.

The proposal gives Member States the ability to set regional limits on new planting authorizations in areas with excess supply, with flexibility to set these limits as low as 0% to adapt production to market demand. It also allows Member States to set conditions on the use of grape varieties and production methods to avoid yield increases and preserve traditional practices. A maximum threshold of hectares of planted vineyards is proposed, below which Member States are exempt from applying the planting authorizations scheme, addressing oversupply risks.

CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  The central theme of this European Commission mandate is to create a competitive European economy. The Competitiveness Compass provides us with the vision of Europe as an economic powerhouse, an attractive investment destination, and a manufacturing centre. The Savings and Investments Union (SIU) is one of the five horizontal enablers of the Compass.  Europe faces vast investment needs in strategic sectors such as defence, space, biotech, cleantech, and artificial intelligence. Too often, the absence of sufficient risk capital forces innovators to rely on foreign investors, or to relocate abroad. When this happens, Europe loses not just businesses, but also indirectly jobs, innovative capacity, and the ability to build and sustain a competitive advantage in the economic sectors of the future.  The need to act urgently has been widely recognised at the highest political level. In 2024, at the request of the European Council and the President of the European Commission respectively, Enrico Letta and Mario Draghi delivered landmark reports, each recommending measures to improve capital market integration and efficient supervision so as to restore the competitiveness of the EU economy and meet the geopolitical challenges it is facing. In addition, the Eurogroup, the European Council, have also urged progress to create truly integrated European capital markets which are accessible to all citizens and businesses across the Union. This is a shared objective among all European institutions and has widespread support throughout European capitals.  The Euro Summit of March 2025 emphasised the urgency and shared responsibility for rapid progress on creating the SIU. The European Parliament has argued that capital markets integration is a necessary pillar of the Union's investment strategy and supports the Commission's intention to propose measures to strengthen supervisory convergence tools and achieve more unified direct supervision of capital markets. The European Central Bank (ECB) has also been vocal in its support for the project.  Beyond Europe, international organisations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), have called for action to address the remaining barriers to EU financial market integration. Interconnecting national financial markets across the EU brings clear and tangible benefits. It unlocks cross-border capital flows, making investment more efficient while deepening liquidity and reducing costs for businesses and investors. It strengthens financial resilience by spreading risks across a wider pool of instruments and markets, and it spurs innovation and competition, leading to better products and services for citizens.  To support the objectives of the SIU, this proposal calls for converting Directive 98/26/EC (the Settlement Finality Directive or SFD) into a Regulation. The SFD, adopted in 1998, aims to reduce systemic risk in payment systems and securities settlement systems within the EU by ensuring the finality and irrevocability of transfer orders once entered into a designated system, even in the event of a participant’s insolvency. It provides legal certainty around the timing and enforceability of settlement, netting, and collateral arrangements, thereby safeguarding the smooth functioning of financial markets. The SFD also establishes common rules for the designation of systems and the protection of collateral posted in connection with participation in such systems and clarifies which law applies in certain cross-border operations. While the scope of the SFD is limited to systems governed by the laws of a Member State, Member States may extend SFD-like protections to domestic entities that participate in third-country systems.  Since its adoption in 1998, the SFD has been amended six times to reflect the evolving structure of EU financial markets. The first amendment, 1 in 2009, extended settlement finality protections to credit claims and to links between payment and securities settlement systems. The second, 2 introduced in 2010, aligned the Directive 3 with the creation of the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs), clarifying the roles of EU and national supervisors. The third, 4 in 2012, introduced updates to ensure consistency with the new EU framework for central counterparties and trade repositories. The fourth, 5 in 2014, adjusted definitions and references to align the SFD with the EU’s harmonised securities settlement regime. The fifth, 6 in 2019, refined provisions relating to third-country participants and system interoperability to ensure continuity in the event of bank resolution. Most recently, in 2024, the sixth amendment 7 expanded the scope of eligible participants to include non-bank payment service providers, modernising the framework to reflect changes in EU retail payment infrastructure.  In 2023, the Commission published a Report on the review of the Settlement Finality Directive. At that time, the Report concluded that the SFD works well and that no major overhaul of the Directive is necessary. Nevertheless, the Commission noted the impact of new technologies, lack of legal certainty that generates additional costs for market participants and differences in transposition of SFD provisions by Member States that creates difficulties and costs in cross-border situations.  Nevertheless, the SFD has played a central role in ensuring stability and legal certainty for payments and securities settlement systems in the EU by protecting transfer orders and netting arrangements from the effects of insolvency. However, its national transposition has resulted in significant divergences that undermine its effectiveness in fostering a coherent and integrated European post-trade landscape. Member States have adopted different approaches to the designation of systems, creating inconsistencies in the scope of protection available to participants. Similarly, the definitions and treatment of participants and indirect participants vary widely, leading to uncertainty over who benefits from settlement finality protections. There are also differences in the types of securities that qualify for protection, with some jurisdictions applying narrow interpretations that limit coverage, while others adopt broader criteria.  Further inconsistencies relate to the moment of settlement finality, where Member States differ in determining the precise point at which transfer orders become irrevocable and protected from insolvency proceedings – an issue that is especially problematic for cross-border settlements involving multiple systems. Divergent conflict-of-law rules and the treatment of EU entities participating in third-country systems further complicate matters, creating uncertainty about which legal regime governs finality in multi-jurisdictional transactions. In addition, designation practices and levels of transparency vary across Member States, with some providing limited public information about designated systems and their participants, hindering legal clarity and market confidence. These divergences collectively weaken the harmonising intent of the SFD, introduce legal and operational risks for cross-border settlement, and hamper the efficiency and integration of EU financial markets. Furthermore, both the SFD and related provisions in Directive 2002/47/EC (the Financial Collateral Directive or FCD) lack full technological neutrality, as their provisions were drafted with traditional, account-based systems in mind. This creates legal uncertainty for the use of distributed ledger technology (DLT) and tokenised forms of cash or securities, which may not clearly fall within existing definitions of ‘transfer orders’, ‘securities’, or ‘settlement systems’, thereby limiting innovation and consistency in their application.  Converting the SFD into a Regulation and updating definitions of key concepts would enhance legal certainty, consistency, and market integration across the EU. The Regulation also aims to ensure sufficient technological neutrality to help support the implementation of new technologies, such as DLT, to bring efficient solutions to the market while ensuring that risks are appropriately mitigated. Moreover, further harmonisation would align with broader EU initiatives such as the Capital Markets Union and the Savings and Investment Union, fostering investor confidence and improving the resilience and competitiveness of the post-trade ecosystem.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  The proposal converts the SFD into a Regulation (the Settlement Finality Regulation or SFR). To achieve this objective, the proposal sets out in a more precise way matters related to protections granted by the SFD to achieve a harmonised approach across the EU. This relates, in particular to: (i) legal certainty for digital innovation; (ii) conflict-of-law rules; (iii) participation of EU entities in third-country systems; (iv) the scope of participants; (v) the scope of eligible securities; (vi) designation practices for EU systems; (vii) transparency; and (viii) settlement finality moments.  As the payment and settlement of securities transactions lies at the core of the capital markets, the proposed legislative changes would contribute to the development of a safer and more efficient post-trading landscape in the EU, in line with the objectives of the SIU. In addition, the SFR, by clarifying definitions and scope with respect to the provisions contained therein, would support innovation and the uptake of new technologies. Overall, the SFR would reduce the systemic risk associated with participation in payment and securities settlement systems, and particularly the risk linked to insolvency of a participant in such systems. Well-functioning payment systems and securities settlement systems such as those operated by central securities depositories (CSDs) ensure that payments and securities transactions can be made safely and with certainty. This is an important foundation for the financial sector and thus for the SIU. In this way, the SFR is complementary to other regulations making up the post-trade environment, i.e. the CSDR, the FCD, and EMIR.  • Consistency with other Union policies  This initiative aims to complement the broader Commission agenda to make EU capital markets more competitive and resilient. A competitive and efficient post-trade environment, of which settlement and payment systems are a pivotal feature, is an essential element to achieve the SIU objectives. A fully functioning and integrated market for capital will allow the EU’s economy to grow in a sustainable way and be more competitive, in line with the strategic priorities of the Commission, focused on creating the right conditions for job creation, growth and investment.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) confers to the European Parliament and the Council the competence to adopt measures for the approximation of the provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States which relate to the establishment and functioning of the internal market. Article 114 of the TFEU allows the EU to take measures not only to eliminate current obstacles to the exercise of the fundamental freedoms, but to prevent such obstacles from emerging, including those that make it difficult for economic operators, including investors, to take full advantage of the benefits of the internal market.  Currently, effective solutions to ensure cross-border provision of services in these sectors are either absent or hindered by varying national rules implementing EU legal acts. Moreover, EU rules need updating to better facilitate financial services provision using new technologies, in particular DLT, that can enhance capital market efficiency. Divergences in Member State transposition of the SFD exacerbate these issues.  This proposal supports the correct and safe functioning of the single market, safeguard competition and preserve incentives for innovation. Consequently, the appropriate legal basis is Article 114 TFEU.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  According to the principle of subsidiarity provided in Article 5(3) of the TFEU, action at Union level should be taken only when the envisaged aims cannot be achieved sufficiently by Member States alone and can, because of the scale of effects of the proposed actions, be better achieved by the EU.  The SFD aims to reduce systemic risk arising from insolvency of participants in payment and securities settlement systems. It does so by stipulating protections for the irrevocability and finality of transfer orders entered into a payment or settlement system. The transposition of the SFD was left to Member States, leading to divergent application and interpretation across the settlement and payment systems designated in the EU. This creates frictions in cross-border operations and undermines the integration of the EU capital market.  Converting the SFD into a Regulation will allow for a more consistent and homogeneous approach across the EU.  • Proportionality  T he proposed conversion of the SFD into a Regulation – together with the targeted amendments to its substantive provisions – should be regarded as proportionate and necessary to help achieve the objectives of the SIU. Fragmentation and divergences in the application of settlement finality rules across Member States has long been a barrier to cross-border financial activity. Divergent transpositions of key definitions and concepts, inconsistent national practices in system designation and determining the moment of finality create legal uncertainty and additional operational and legal risk in cross-border operations. A Regulation would directly harmonise these rules, ensuring consistent application across the Union and facilitating smoother, more predictable financial operations. In this way, the proposal supports one of the core goals of the SIU, that of a more integrated and efficient single market for savings and investment.  As a Regulation, settlement finality provisions would not impose disproportionate burdens on market participants or authorities. Instead, a Regulation would eliminate duplicative legal and compliance efforts that currently arise from having to navigate 27 disparate transpositions and interpretations of the SFD. The legal uniformity achieved via a Settlement Finality Regulation would simplify participation in multiple systems, reduce costs linked to legal due diligence, and enhance legal certainty, especially in cross-border situations and in the case of participation in third-country systems. Finally, amendments linked to ensuring technological neutrality would allow for greater legal certainty in the case that systems and assets are underpinned by new technologies, decreasing the need for costly legal work to ensure regulatory compliance.  • Choice of the instrument  The SFD allows for national transposition, which has led to divergent interpretations and applications among Member States – particularly concerning the designation of systems, the scope of protection for collateral, and the treatment of cross-border participants. The divergent national approaches cause legal uncertainty, prevent market integration and inhibit cross-border transactions. A Regulation would be directly applicable, eliminating these discrepancies and ensuring that the same rules apply uniformly across the Union. This would reduce legal risk and complexity for market participants operating in multiple jurisdictions, support more efficient cross-border settlement and interoperability between systems. It is thus appropriate and necessary to repeal the SFD and replace it with a Regulation.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  In 2023 the Commission published a review 8 of settlement finality in payment and securities settlement systems including its application to domestic institutions participating in third-country systems. Although the review concluded that the SFD worked well and no major overhaul seemed warranted, it also pointed out that impacts of new technology as well as the lack of legal certainty in certain areas led to potential additional costs for financial market participants. It also noted that a lower level of harmonisation leaves considerable discretion in transposition and implementation to Member States and may create difficulties in cross-border situations.  • Stakeholder consultations  The Commission has consulted stakeholders throughout the process of preparing this proposal, in particular:  · A public consultation 9 on the operation of the SFD, which was organised between 12 February 2021 and 7 May 2021. 72 stakeholders replied to the targeted consultation. The lack of harmonisation and legal certainty as to how Member State insolvency rules apply to EU participants in third-country systems was raised by many respondents . There was also a general agreement to add CSDs to the list of eligible (direct) participants in systems governed by the law of a Member State.  · A stakeholder workshop 10 on identifying and addressing barriers to integration of market infrastructure and scaling up of investment funds in the EU on 26 September 2024. The event included a panel on post-trading, which explored the potential benefits and challenges of post-trade consolidation as well as the regulatory landscape.  · A targeted consultation 11 on integration of EU capital markets was organised between 15 April 2025 and 10 June 2025. Regarding the SFD, some respondents considered that the Directive work ed well, and no modifications we re necessary, except for some clarifications regarding its application to DLT-based systems. However, other respondents supported converting the SFD into a Regulation to tackle inconsistent implementation of the SFD across the EU. Respondents also highlighted the need for clearer guidance on the conflict of law rules, as well as to tackle uncertainty regarding the protection of indirect participants and the extension of protection to participants in third-country systems and to DLT-based systems. Several respondents noted that the current SFD framework wa s too narrow and that a more comprehensive approach would be beneficial (e.g. broadening the scope of eligible participants). Some respondents suggested that SFD protection should be extended to activities in relation to any assets, not just cash and securities, and that the definition of ‘ system ’ should be broadened to include more types of systems . In addition, some respondents indicated that the information about each designated system should be published so that settlement finality moments within the SFD would be harmonised, and clearer definitions of ‘ collateral security ’ and ‘ financial collateral ’ in the FCD should be provided. The misalignment of these definitions was mentioned by more than half of respondents as creating complexities for efficient collateral management.  • Collection and use of expertise  In preparing the proposal the Commission relied on external expertise and data from the following sources:  · The Advisory Group on Market Infrastructures for Securities and Collateral (AMI-SeCo) 12 published in September 2025 a report 13 on remaining barriers to integration in securities post-trade services. The report notes that although EU regulatory measures ha ve dismantled barriers (including finality issues), frictions remain due to differing national implementations or interpretations.  · A study on reducing fragmentation in post-trading infrastructures in Europe, commissioned 14 by the European Commission in September 2024. The study 15 was based on publicly available information and data but also included 98 structured interviews with 76 institutions from 21 European countries, including financial market infrastructures, market participants and supervisory and policy bodies. The study notes the definition of settlement finality as one of the areas where Member States divergence in interpretation and implementation act s as a barrier to capital market integration. Furthermore, the study recommends converting the SFD into a Regulation as it would ensure uniform application of settlement finality rules, reduce legal risk and strengthen the foundation of interoperable, consolidated market infrastructures.  • Impact assessment  The proposal is supported by an Impact Assessment, specifically the sectoral annex on post-trade (Annex 8) to the Impact Assessment accompanying the initiative on market integration and supervision in EU capital markets.  With regards to potential amendments to the SFD, the Impact Assessment considered three options:  · Option 1 – Do nothing;  · Option 2 – Comprehensive review of the SFD to enhance the functioning of market infrastructure;  · Option 3 – Extensive review of the SFD to impose an integrated market.  Option 2 and Option 3 assume that the SFD would be converted into a Regulation. The options however differ with respect to the scope of the protections that would have been granted by the SFR. The modalities that make up Option 2 and Option 3 are explained below:  Table: Row 1 — ; Option 2; Option 3 Row 2 — Legal certainty for digital innovation; Changes to definitions and concepts, i.e. ‘system’, ‘participant’ and ‘institution’, to make them DLT compatible and thus to allow certain DLT-based systems to benefit from settlement finality protections.; All the provisions of Option 2, plus expanding legal certainty to other aspects of holding of securities, as well as further harmonising the designation of systems where they are operated by using DLT. Row 3 — Applicable rules to conflict-of-law; Clarify conflict-of-law rules existing in SFD so that they can be directly applied, including in the context of DLT-based systems and tokenised securities.; The applicable conflict-of-law rule would be governed by the Hague Convention on the applicable law to certain rights in respect of securities held with an intermediary. Row 4 — Participation of EU entities in third-country systems; Harmonised requirements for the registration of third-country systems and introduction of a central access point (ESMA 16 and EBA 17 ). EU credit institutions, investment firms, public authorities or publicly guaranteed undertakings participating in third-country systems registered in the EU benefit from settlement finality protections. Registration would be done by Member States for their respective Member State. No EU wide registration.; Harmonised requirements for the registration of third-country systems and central access point. The responsibility for registering third-country systems would be given to ESMA (for securities settlement systems) and the ECB/ESCB 18 (for payment systems), leading to an EU wide registration. Row 5 — Scope of participants; Expand the list of participants of a system to all legal entities that comply with certain conditions in settlement finality rules and in the rulebook of the system.; Any entity allowed by a system operator to participate in the system would be considered a participant. This would require amendments to other legislation, including the CSDR, to ensure alignment. Row 6 — Scope of eligible securities; A common definition of eligible securities.; Operators of designated systems could choose the instruments that would be included in the protections provided. Row 7 — Designation practices for EU systems; Harmonised requirements for the EU designation of systems and streamline designation practices, in particular with respect to the type of information to provide in a notification, assessment criteria or applicable timelines.; ESMA (for securities settlement systems) and the ECB/ESCB (for payment systems) would be responsible for the assessment and designation of EU systems on an EU wide basis. Row 8 — Transparency; Member States to provide ESMA with up-to-date information on designated EU systems, which would be made publicly available. The scope of information to be provided under Option 2 would also be expanded.; Information on SFR-designated systems to be made public in a centralised form. There would be harmonised reporting to ESMA, including on designated systems, rules and participants, as well as third-country systems that benefit from domestic participant protections. Unrestricted access would be granted by ESMA to information on insolvency proceedings against participants of any designated EU system. Row 9 — Settlement finality moments; The SFR would determine the moments of entry and irrevocability of transfer orders into a system, and potentially the moment of finality of the execution of transfer orders.; All three settlement finality moments would be harmonised at EU level, uniformly for all types of systems.  The Impact Assessment concluded that Option 2 is the option that best addresses the identified barriers, while ensuring proportionality, effectiveness and coherence of the proposed solutions. The option to do nothing (Option 1) would not resolve any of the identified problems, rather leaving them to bottom-up industry or Member State initiatives. This would not remove existing barriers to market integration, with persistent differing national transpositions generating additional costs for market participants when operating cross-border. At the same time the Impact Assessment considered that although the flexibility provided by the SFD under Option 1 can help mitigate lack of harmonisation/ Member State differences in insolvency, corporate or securities laws frameworks, it would not make up for the costs associated with existing barriers to market integration.  Table: Row 1 — ; Option 2; Option 3 Row 2 — Legal certainty for digital innovation; Uniform SFR protection for the system from the insolvency of EU participants irrespective of the technology provided that all SFR requirements are met. Reduced supervision costs. Facilitating innovation via clarity in SFR application.; The additional measures, i.e. to explicitly recognise digital tokens or ledger entries as carrying the same (or comparable) legal rights as traditional securities, potentially by developing an optional EU-level legal framework for digital securities (i.e. a 28th regime), go beyond the scope of the SFR and would warrant consideration as part of the SIU reflections on a 28th regime, in line with what suggested by stakeholders. Row 3 — Applicable rules to conflict-of-law; Increased legal certainty in case of cross-border securities transactions. Savings for market participants in legal opinions and compliance costs. These benefits would extend to DLT-based systems.; Increased legal certainty and lower compliance costs. Market fragmentation would remain and would negatively impact overall protection of the system. This would not support market integration and efficiency. Row 4 — Participation of EU entities in third-country systems; Level playing field. Lower costs for EU participants of collateral requirements required by third-country systems to which they participate.; Maximum harmonisation, ease of compliance thanks to empowerments to ESMA/EBA/ESCB. This would require a substantial increase of resources for these entities. Hence potential delays and costs. Row 5 — Scope of participants; Harmonised scope of protection across Member States. Costs limited to Member States needing to amend their legislation, if necessary (Member State to expand the protection beyond the scope of the Regulation).; Support for innovation, but less certainty about participation in a system. Market fragmentation. Unlevel playing field between operators of DLT-based and systems that do not use DLT. Row 6 — Scope of eligible securities; Reduced market fragmentation and reduced costs of cross-border transactions. Costs limited to Member States needing to amend their legislation, if necessary (Member State to expand the protection beyond the scope of the Regulation).; Support for innovation, but less certainty about participation in a system. Market fragmentation. Unlevel playing field between operators of DLT-based and systems that do not use DLT. Row 7 — Designation practices for EU systems; Level playing field, easier cross-border settlement and reduced fragmentation. By expanding to DLT-based systems, also support for innovation. Some costs for Member States, as they would have to adjust their designation processes.; Greatest possible harmonisation. Market integration. Costs and delays for ESMA/EBA/ESCB to build necessary competencies and infrastructure. Row 8 — Transparency; Reduced market fragmentation, increased legal certainty and easier risk monitoring. Greater trust in designated systems, including DLT-based systems. Cross-border activity, further market integration and scale effects. Cost for publishing the additional information limited for system operators, but slightly higher for ESMA due to additional quality checks.; Transparency on additional elements would unlikely provide additional benefits in terms of competition, trust or risk management. Row 9 — Settlement finality moments; Reduced fragmentation. Interoperability, easier set-up of CSD links and greater cross-border settlement.; Full harmonisation – without taking into account system specificities – is detrimental to efficiency of a system. Costly application in a DLT setting, requiring additional safeguards.  Based on the above analysis it was deemed that Option 2 would overall be more effective, efficient and coherent than Option 3, even if Option 3 would, by bringing even greater harmonisation of settlement finality provisions, be superior to Option 2 in improving supervision and reducing divergencies. In conclusion, Option 2 is the preferred Option as it is coherent with the objectives of the SIU, while also being more proportionate and cost-effective. It will also promote a more integrated, efficient, and innovative EU capital market. Option 2 helps reduce fragmentation and promotes a more harmonised market, which is in line with the broader goals of the SIU.  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  Converting the SFD into a Regulation simultaneously fulfils the objectives of simplifying existing EU law, cutting red tape and making it easier to comply with.  The SFR would enhance legal certainty and consistency for market participants. Furthermore, by ensuring technology neutrality, users of DLT would be able to test and bring to market new technologies without unnecessary costs. The SFR would also eliminate the discrepancies in interpretation caused by national implementation. This would reduce legal risk and compliance complexity for market participants operating in multiple jurisdictions. Lastly, fostering investor confidence and improving the resilience and competitiveness of the post-trade ecosystem would contribute to the efficiency of EU capital markets and indirectly the competitiveness of the EU economy.  SMEs would not be directly impacted by this proposal as the large majority of firms active in the provision of infrastructure (trading and post-trading services) are large, well-established companies. However, via efficiency gains and increased competition in capital market services, non-financial SMEs would benefit via easier and cheaper access to market financing, including for financing innovation and growth. This positive effect should also apply to SMEs using exclusively bank-based financing as this financing channel stands in competition with capital-market based financing.  In terms of costs, clarity on the application of the SFR would reduce costs for system operators as it would decrease the need to seek legal advice on rule interpretation and to comply with local idiosyncrasies. Lastly, formalising the DLT regime and expanding the scope of eligible assets and volume thresholds would make the regime more attractive. Market participants would be able to engage in long-term planning and extend operations beyond small testing scales. Harmonisation and targeted changes to the SFD would furthermore allow for designations (and protection) under the settlement finality rulebook for DLT-based systems. Overall, the changes should promote innovation by increasing the potential returns of investments and by providing increased legal certainty for DLT-based innovations.  • Fundamental rights  The EU is committed to high standards of protection of fundamental rights and is signatory to a broad set of conventions on human rights. In this context, the proposal is not likely to have a direct impact on these rights, as listed in the main United Nations conventions on human rights, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which is an integral part of the EU Treaties, and the European Convention on Human Rights.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  The proposal will have budgetary implications according to the financial statement in Annex 2.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  This proposal does not require an implementation plan.  The monitoring of settlement and payment systems is also the task of ESMA, EBA and the ESCB, which are mandated to provide the Commission with a report on the functioning of the settlement finality regime within 5 years of entry into force of the SFR.  The proposal for the SFR mandates the Commission to prepare a report to the European Parliament and the Council assessing the application of the Regulation, together with amendments, if justified.  • Explanatory documents (for directives)  N/A  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  Article 1(2) specifies the articles of this Regulation that apply to participants established in the Union when they participate to registered systems.  Article 2 defines several terms and concepts necessary to interpret the provisions of the Regulation, including ‘settlement’, ‘clearing’, ‘clearing system’, ‘central counterparty’, ‘clearing house’, ‘participant’, ‘indirect participant’, ‘client’, ‘book entry’, ‘netting’, ‘account’, ‘collateral’, ‘business day’ and ‘working day’.  Article 3 clarifies that the operator of a system governed by the law of a Member State, irrespective of the currency in which it provides for the settlement, clearing or execution of transfer orders, may apply for designation. Furthermore, a competent authority may, on grounds of systemic risk, designate an existing system for the settlement, clearing and execution of instructions related to instruments other than the ones already covered by the system.  In order to provide uniform designation conditions and a harmonised procedure, Article 4 explains the procedure for granting and refusing the designation of a system. In this case, the competent authority is the one in the Member State whose law governs the system. In particular, the Article specifies the time available for the competent authority to accept or reject an application for designating a system and the assessment period to grant or refuse the designation. Similarly, Article 5 specifies the conditions for designating a system. ESMA, in close cooperation with the ESCB, may develop draft regulatory technical standards to further specify these conditions (for settlement and clearing systems). A similar provision applies to EBA for payment systems.  Article 6 explains that a competent authority shall notify ESMA it has designated a system. Furthermore, to harmonise the information to be made publicly available, Article 6 lists the elements this notification should contain. ESMA shall publish the system designation, as well as any updates to the information that made up the notification, without undue delay on its website.  Article 7 specifies who can qualify as participants to a designated system. It also explains under what conditions (systemic risk) Member States may consider an indirect participant to be a participant. Article 7 asks the system operator to establish non-discriminatory, transparent and objective admission criteria to a designated system.  Article 8 tasks the operator of a designated system for its and the system’s compliance with the provisions of this Regulation. It is to notify  the competent authority, without delay, of any material changes affecting the operator’s and the system’s compliance with this Regulation.  Article 9 specifies the conditions under which a competent authority may withdraw, with the involvement of the national competent authority, the designation of a system. It also explains the involvement of ESMA, EBA and the ESCB in the process of withdrawing a designation. The competent authority shall inform without delay, the system operator, the national competent authority, ESMA, EBA and the ESCB of the withdrawal of the designation.  Article 10 requires each Member State to appoint one or more competent authorities, in particular for the designation of systems and the registration of third-country systems.  Article 11 explains the rules and responsibilities associated with the exchange of information between competent authorities, national competent authorities, ESMA, EBA and the ESCB in the exercise of duties under the Regulation.  Article 12 deals with the registration of third-country systems that wish to be registered in one or several Member States. Such a request shall be submitted to ESMA and disseminated to registering authorities. If a participant to a third-country system is established in a Member State, the registering authority of that Member State may register the system.  Article 13 defines the procedure for granting and refusing registration. It specifies the registration process, the duration of the assessment and the methods of communication with the system operator of a third-country system. It also mandates ESMA for clearing and settlement systems) and EBA (for payment systems), in close cooperation with the ESCB, to develop draft regulatory standards to specify the information to be provided in the application for designation and in the application for registration, as well as implementing technical standards to define the uniform electronic formats for the application for designation and the application for registration.  Article 14 sets out the conditions for registration of third-country systems.  Article 15 explains the notification of registered systems and requests ESMA to publish on its website, within 2 working days from the registering authority’s notification of the decision to register the third-country system.  Article 16 defines the conditions under which a registering authority may withdraw the registration of a system.  Article 17 provides that transfer orders and netting, including close-out netting provision, shall be legally enforceable and binding on third parties, even in the event of insolvency proceedings against a participant, provided that transfer orders were entered into the system before the moment of opening of such insolvency proceedings.  Article 18 determines how the moment of entry of a transfer order into designated systems, including interoperable systems, should be determined.  Article 19 provides that the opening of insolvency proceedings against a participant or a system operator of an interoperable system shall not prevent funds or financial instruments available on the settlement account or on accounts holding collateral of that participant or system operator of an interoperable system from being used to fulfil that participant’s obligations in the designated system, or registered system, or in an interoperability arrangement on the business day of the opening of the insolvency proceedings.  Article 20 defines the moment of irrevocability of a transfer order to facilitate the application of insolvency law to transfer orders that have been entered into a system.  Article 21 defines the moment of settlement finality, i.e. the moment when the discharge of the respective obligations of the parties to a transaction are completed in an unconditional and irrevocable manner. This aims to ensure the highest possible degree of consistency regarding settlement finality protection across systems and in turn facilitate cross-border activity. The rules of each designated system shall determine the specific moment where settlement shall be final within the system in accordance with the appliable law for transfer of ownership and other rights. Interoperable systems shall ensure, to the extent possible, that the rules of the systems are coordinated in this regard. ESMA and EBA, where applicable and both in close cooperation with the ESCB, may further specify, via draft regulatory technical standards, the following settlement finality moments: (i) the moment of entry of a transfer order into a system; (ii) the moment of irrevocability of a transfer order that into a system; and (iii) the moment of final settlement, for securities settlement systems not operated by a CSD, clearing and payment systems, including for DLT-based systems.  Article 22 provides that the moment of opening of insolvency proceedings shall be the moment when the relevant judicial or administrative authority handed down its decision. It furthermore specifies which authorities need to be notified.  Article 23 states that insolvency proceedings shall not have retroactive effects on the rights and obligations of a participant from its participation in a designated system or a system registered in a Member States where the participant is established.  Article 24 determines the law governing the rights and obligations of participants in the event of insolvency proceedings.  Article 25 determines that the rights of holders of collateral security shall be governed by the law of the Member State where the financial instrument is provided. Article 25(2) determines that the rights of the holders of a collateral security provided in connection with participation in a system should be determined by the law of the Member State in which the register, or the account where the collateral security is recorded, is located. Article 25(3) provides a derogation, where it is not possible to determine the location of a register. In such a case the rights with respect to the financial instrument provided as security, shall be governed by the law of the Member State governing the system. Article 25(4) defines what is meant by the reference to the law of a Member State.  Article 26 sets out the role of the central database, which facilitates the exchange of information and documents relevant to the recipients under this Regulation. The article also provides for access to the central database by competent authorities, registering authorities and national competent authorities.  Article 27 confers, for an indeterminate period, the power to adopt delegated acts under this Regulation on the Commission.  Article 28 sets out transitional measures, in particular clarifying that a transfer order which enters the system before the entry into force of this Regulation but is settled thereafter, shall be considered a transfer order under this Regulation.  Article 29 requires the Commission to draft a general report and requires ESMA, in close cooperation with the ESCB and the EBA, to submit a Report to the Commission on the functioning of the settlement finality regime, within 6 years of entry into force of this Regulation.  Article 30 repeals the SFD.  Article 31 amends certain provisions of the FCD, in particular by including in its scope cash, financial instruments and credit claims if they are issued or recorded on DLT. It also defines the terms and concepts necessary to interpret the provisions of the Regulation, i.e. ‘account’ and expands certain definitions to include digital recording, including DLT. Finally, it provides the transposition deadline for those amendments.  Article 32 determines the date of entry into force of the Regulation.  2025/0381 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  on settlement finality and repealing Directive 98/26/EC and amending Directive 2002/47/EC on financial collateral arrangements  (Text with EEA relevance)  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank 19  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 20 ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure 21 ,  Whereas:  (1) This proposal is part of a package designed to establish a single market for financial services by addressing market inefficiencies resulting from fragmentation and to create truly integrated European capital markets which are accessible to all citizens and businesses across the Union . The package seeks to unlock the U nion ’s financial markets potential by providing access to more efficient capital-market based financing and facilitating cross-border capital flows, which in turn sh ould support the U nion economy, stimulate job creation and enhance competitiveness.  (2) Directive 98/26/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 22 la ys down principles and rules aiming to reduce systemic risk arising from the insolvency of participants in payment systems and securities settlement systems by disapplying certain national insolvency rules, where a party to a transaction becomes insolvent, allowing payments and securities transactions to be made and settled safely. Directive 98/26/EC also protects collateral provided for by the insolvent party and clarifies which law is to apply in certain cross-border situations.  (3) A public consultation conducted in 2021 and the 2023 Commission report 23 showed that the obligations laid down in Directive 98/26/EC as well as protections granted towards domestic institutions participating in third-country systems were transposed differently by Member States, resulting in an unlevel playing field for Union systems and participants, and creating barriers to the smooth functioning of the single market.  (4) Divergent national approaches have resulted in the fragmentation of the single market. Systems and participants are subject to different rules in different Member States. In this respect, a system could be designated in one Member State and not in another , or a transfer order could be protected in one Member State and not in another, depending on the law of the Member State applicable to the system. The divergent national approaches cause legal uncertainty, prevent market integration and inhibit cross-border transactions .  (5) T o ensure that provisions imposing obligations on systems, their operators and their participants are applied in a uniform manner throughout the Union, thereby facilitat ing market integration and cross-border transactions , and ensur ing greater legal certainty, it is appropriate and necessary to repeal Directive 98/26/EC and replace it with a Regulation.  (6) T o enable a wider range of systems to benefit from the protections offered to systems and system operators , t he concepts used and the rules laid down should be neutral as regards the use of any particular technology, including distributed ledger technology (DLT). In particular, any references to register or recordings should include instances where such registers are established on DLT or otherwise on distributed ledgers and where recordings are made onto such ledgers-based registers and hence may or may not include wallets or other digital representations of ownership and rights.  (7) Regulation (EU) 2022/858 of the European Parliament and of the Council 24 allows for market infrastructures based on DLT to test and experiment with the provision of certain services via DLT, including by establishing systems that settle transfer orders in DLT-based financial instruments . It should be possible to designate such systems under this Regulation, subject to their compliance with the conditions set out in both Regulation (EU) 2022/858 and this Regulation. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the European B anking Authority ( EBA ) should be mandated to further specify the rules on how to assess and determine settlement finality in systems that use DLT .  (8) Since the national insolvency rules of the Member State whose law gover n s a system apply to that system, s ystems should be designated by the authorities of the Member State whose law governs the system, on the basis of uniform designation conditions and a harmonised procedure.  (9) Member States have adopted different approaches regarding the type of information to be publicly disclosed on Union systems and third-country systems to which they chose to extend the protections of Directive 98/26/EC. T o address the existing information asymmetry across Member States and to harmonise the information to be made publicly available, the type of information to be provided to the authorities in charge of the designation or registration of a system should be harmonised. Furthermore, ESMA should publish the information in a centralised way to facilitate access to that information. To ensure legal certainty , the information communicated to ESMA for the purpose of publication should be relevant, accurate and up-to-date.  (10) The list of entities that can be considered as participants in a system should take into account the different participation models adopted by systems, while ensuring that the aim to protect the financial system from systemic risk is met . To th at end, the entities to be admitted as participants should fulfil certain conditions to avoid creating unnecessary risks for the system in which they participate. S uch conditions should , however, not impose additional requirements where the system operator already applies admission requirements to the system under Union law when admitting new entities as participants to its designated systems, as in the case of central counterparties ( CCPs ) and central security deposit orie s ( CSDs ) . It should be possible to include as participants in a system entities that perform validation or consensus functions that are essential for maintaining settlement integrity.  (11) T o ensure an effective application of the settlement finality protection s , Member States should nominate the authority or authorities responsible for the designation, the registration and the communication of the opening of insolvency proceedings . Those authorities should be granted the necessary powers for the exercise of their functions. They should cooperate and exchange information as necessary with each other and with ESMA and the members of the European System of Central Banks ( ESCB ) . To facilitate their tasks and increase transparency across the Union, the list of those authorities should be made public.  (12) Member States should be able to apply the protections provided to Union systems to entities established on their territory that participate directly in third-country systems and to collateral security provided in connection with participation in such third-country systems. In order to remedy the unlevel playing field regarding participation of Union entities in third-country system s stemming from the different national regimes developed by Member States to extend the protections of Directive 98/96/EC, a harmonised regime for registration by Member States of third-country systems should be laid down . It should be based on a formalised and harmonised procedure that ensures the application of clear standards and that streamlines access conditions for all Union entities participating in a given third-country system. Registration of third-country systems by Member States should be done by the Member State in which an entity participating in such system is established. Th at may , however, result in several Member States registering the same third-country arrangement if members are established in several Member States. To prevent any unlevel-playing field for entities established in different Member States, the registration of such systems should be done in a coordinated and convergent way and be facilitated by ESMA , EBA and the ESCB.  (13) The reduction of systemic risk requires, in particular, the finality of settlement and the enforceability of collateral security. Transfer orders and their netting should therefore be legally enforceable in all Member States and binding on third parties. Rules on enforceability of netting should not prevent systems from testing, before the netting takes place, whether orders that have entered the system comply with the rules of that system and allow the settlement of that system to take place.  (14) Settlement should be considered final when the parties to the contract underlying the settlement have fully discharge d their obligations towards the other party in an unconditional and irrevocable manner. The moment a transfer order enters a system and the moment of irrevocability of a transfer order are important moments for the application of insolvency law to that transfer order. T o ensure the highest possible degree of consistency regarding settlement finality protection across systems, as well as to facilitate cross-border activity in the single market, it is necessary to lay down principles to be used for the determination of those moments for all types of systems. At the same time, those principles should allow for the possibility to develop regulatory technical standards to tailor those principles to the specific characteristics of each system while taking into account the existence of different types of systems, the different technologies used and the mechanics of each system. Systems should include, where they exist, those specific and tailored moments of settlement finality in their rules in a clear manner.  (15) P articipant s or third part ies should not be prevented from exercising any right or claim resulting from the underlying transaction which they may have in law to recovery or restitution in respect of a transfer order which has entered a system, including in case of fraud or technical error, as long as th at leads neither to the unwinding of netting nor to the revocation of the transfer order in the system.  (16) Member States should immediately notify each other of the opening of insolvency proceedings against a participant in the system. Insolvency proceedings should not have a retroactive effect on the rights and obligations of participants in a system.  (17) In the event of insolvency proceedings against a participant in a system, it should be clear which insolvency law is applicable to the rights and obligations of that participant in connection with its participation in a system.  (18) Collateral security should be insulated from the effects of the insolvency law applicable to the insolvent participant. Collateral security comprises all means provided by a participant to the other participants in the settlement system, to secure rights and obligations in connection with that system, including repurchase agreements, statutory liens and fiduciary transfers.  (19) In the case of linked systems, it is necessary to ensure adequate protection of the system operator that provides collateral security to a receiving system operator in the event of insolvency proceedings against that receiving system operator.  (20) It is necessary to provide a conflict of laws rule regarding the rights of holders of collateral security in order to ensure that the law of the Member State where the collateral security was validly created in a register, account or centralised deposit system, determines also the validity and enforceability of that collateral security against the system, the system operator, and against any other person claiming directly or indirectly through it. That rule should only apply to a register, account or centralised deposit system which evidences the existence of proprietary rights in or for the delivery or transfer of the collateral security concerned.  (21) It is necessary to clarify the law of which Member State should apply to determine the rights of the holders of that collateral security. However, in some circumstances, in particular regarding the use of new technologies, it is not always possible to determine in which Member State the register, account or centralised deposit system, where the collateral security is legally recorded, is located. In such cases, the rights of the holders of that collateral security should be determined by the law governing the system concerned in connection with that collateral security.  (22) It is also necessary to provide a conflict of laws rule regarding the law applicable in case of insolvency of a participant. Th at rule should not prejudice the operation and effect of the law of the Member State under which the financial instruments are constituted or of the law of the Member State where the financial instruments may otherwise be located, including, inter alia, the law concerning the creation, ownership or transfer of such financial instruments or of rights in such financial instruments, and should not be interpreted to mean that any such collateral security will be directly enforceable or be capable of being recognised in any such Member State otherwise than in accordance with the law of that Member State.  (23) In view of the changes made in this Regulation, it is necessary to amend Directive 2002/47/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 25 to ensure consistency. Divergences in the scope of this Regulation and Directive 2002/47/EC would cause legal uncertainty and conflicting application, in particular in relation to instruments issued on DLT, as such instruments would be recognised as potential collateral under this Regulation but not necessarily under Directive 2002/47/EC.  (24) ESMA , EBA and the ESCB should play a central role in the application of this Regulation by ensuring consistent application of Union rules by national competent authorities.  (25) The Commission should be empowered to adopt regulatory technical standards developed by ESMA and EBA with regard to further specifying the following: the information to be provided in an application for designation; the conditions for designation; the information to be provided in an application for registration; the moment of entry of a transfer order into a system not operated by a CSD , including DLT-based systems ; the moment of irrevocability of a transfer order entered into a system not operated by a CSD , including DLT-based systems ; and the moment of final settlement in systems not operated by a CSD , including DLT-based systems . The Commission should adopt those regulatory technical standards by means of delegated acts pursuant to Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council 26 and with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Counci l 27  (26) T he Commission should also be empowered to adopt implementing technical standards developed by ESMA or EBA with regard to the electronic format s for the application for designation , and the electronic formats for the application for the registration of a third-country system. The Commission should adopt those implementing technical standards by means of implementing acts pursuant to Article 291 TFEU and in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 and with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council .  (27) The power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) should be delegated to the Commission in respect of amendments to the definition of transfer order to add or remove settlement assets and amendments to the list of participants. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.  (28) Systems which were designated under Directive 98/26/EC, and third-country systems to which Member States extended the protections of that Directive prior to the date of entry into force of this Regulation, should benefit from some transitional measures in order to provide sufficient time for Member States to designate or register those systems, as applicable, in accordance with the conditions set out in this Regulation. The application of the designation and registration requirements for those systems should therefore be deferred.  (29) Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely to ensure a harmonised approach to p rotection against systemic risk arising from the functioning of settlement systems, in connection with the insolvency of any of their participants, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives ,  (30) This Regulation introduces binding requirements for cross-border digital public services within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2024/903 28 . The Digital Dimensions chapter of the Legislative Financial and Digital Statement constitutes the resulting report. This will also be published on the Interoperable Europe Portal following the Act's adoption .  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  TITLE I  OBJECT, SCOPE AND DEFINITIONS  Article 1  Object and scope  1.

TITLE II  SYSTEM DESIGNATION  Article 3  Designated system  1. Where an undertaking operates or intends to operate a system governed by the law of a Member State , such a system operator may apply for that system to be designated in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 4, as a system in the Union to which the settlement finality rules laid down in Articles 1 7 to 2 5 apply.  A system operator referred to in paragraph 1 that, to a limited extent, offers the settlement, clearing or execution of instructions related to instruments other than those referred to in Article 2(1), point (20)(b), may request that the settlement finality rules set out in Articles 17 to 25 also apply in relation to such instruments. The designating authority may allow such instructions to be considered transfer orders when it considers that such a designation is warranted on grounds of systemic risk.  2. The designating authority of the Member State whose law governs the system may designate the system, where at least one of its participants has its head office in that Member State.  Article 4  Procedure for granting and refusing designation  1. A system operator that applies for designation of a system that it operates shall submit an application for designation addressed to the designating authority of the Member State whose law governs the system.  2. The application shall be immediately shared with all of the following:  (a) the designating authority;  (b) where applicable, the national competent authority;  (c) ESMA;  (d) EBA for systems operating transfer orders set out in Article 2(1) , point (20)(a);  (e) The ESCB.  3. The system operator shall include in the application all documents and information necessary to demonstrate that it and the system it operates meet the requirements in this Regulation , including the information listed in Article 6(2) ( a ) and ( c ) to ( g ).  4. An acknowledgement of receipt of the application referred to in paragraph 1 shall be sent to the system operator within two working days of receipt of such application. The designating authority shall, within 20 working days of receipt of the application, determine whether the application contains the documents and information required pursuant to paragraph 3.  Where, during the applicable period specified under the first subparagraph, the designating authority concludes that not all documents and information required pursuant to paragraph 3 have been submitted, it shall request the system operator to submit such additional documents or information. Where the system operator has failed to comply with any such request in full, the designating authority may reject the application.  5. By the end of the time limits referred to in paragraph 4, t he designating authority shall notify the system operator and the authorities listed in paragraph 2, points (b) to (e), as applicable, whether the application is accepted or rejected.  6. After having notified the system operator that the application is accepted, the designating authority shall conduct an assessment of the system operator’s and the system’s compliance with the requirements laid down in this Regulation within 80 working days of the date of the notification referred to in paragraph 5 (‘the assessment period’).  7. During the assessment period, the designating authority may submit questions to, or request complementary information from, the system operator.  Where the system operator has not responded to the questions or provided the requested information within the deadline set by the designating authority, the designating authority may decide to extend once the relevant assessment period by a maximum of 10 working days in total where, in its view, any of the questions or information is material for the assessment. The designating authority shall inform the system operator of the extension provided. The designating authority may take a decision on the application in the absence of the system operator’s response.  8. Within the assessment period , the designating authority shall decide whether to grant or refuse the designation of the system referred to in Article 3. The designating authority shall decide to grant designation only where it is fully satisfied that the system and its operator comply with the requirements laid down in this Regulation.  9. After taking a decision referred to in paragraph 8 , the designating authority shall, inform, without undue delay, the system operator, and the authorities listed in paragraph 2, points (b) to (e), as applicable, of its decision, including a fully reasoned explanation.  Article 5  Conditions for designation  1. A designating authority shall designate a system in accordance with Article 3, only where the designating authority is satisfied that all of the following conditions are fulfilled:  (a) the system is governed by the law of the Member State of the designating authority;  (b) at least one of the participants to the system is established in the Member State of the designating authority;  (c) the system has common rules and standardised procedures for the settlement, clearing, or execution, as applicable, of transfer orders between the participants;  (d) the system has clearly identified in its common rules and standardised procedures the moments of finality that fulfil the requirements set out in Articles 1 8 , 20 and 2 1 .  (e) t he common rules and standardised procedures of the system stipulate, where relevant in accordance with Article 7, the requirements for participation in the system;  (f) there are no apparent conflicts between the common rules and standardised procedures of the system and the law governing the system;  (g) the system operator is able to ensure adequate monitoring of compliance of its system with the common rules and standardised procedures of the system it operates;  (h) the system operator is capable of operating the system, is of sufficiently good repute and has sufficient experience to ensure the sound and prudent management of the system;  (i) the system operator has enough financial resources to operate the system;  (j) the system operator is legally accountable, responsible and liable for the operation of the system, including for any links to other systems and the relationship to third parties and to the authorities;  (k) the system operator has put in place sufficient measures to mitigate the risks related to the operation of the system;  (l) where the system operator consists of a network of nodes operating under a common governance and supervision framework, the common rules and standardised procedures of the system shall ensure that one undertaking is legally accountable, responsible and liable for the operation of the system ;  (m) where the system operator is a consortium of entities, all entities shall be jointly and severally accountable, responsible and liable for the operation of the system.  2. ESMA may, in close cooperation with the ESCB, develop draft regulatory technical standards to further specify the conditions referred to in paragraph 1 for securities settlement systems and clearing systems.  The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council 38 .  3. EBA may, in close cooperation with the ESCB, develop draft regulatory technical standards to further specify the conditions referred to in paragraph 1 for payment systems.  The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 109 3 /2010 39 .  Article 6  Notification of a designated system  4. A designating authority shall notify , simultaneously and without undue delay, ESMA and the system operator of its decision taken pursuant to Article 4 . The designation shall be effective from the date of notification .  5. The notification referred to in paragraph 1 shall contain at least all of the following information, as of the date of the designation:  (a) the identification of the system, the law governing the system, the system operator and the designating authority;  (b) the date on which the system was designated;  (c) the Member State in which the system operator is established and the national competent authority , where applicable ;  (d) whether the system is a securities settlement system, a clearing system or a payment system;  (e) the finality moments of the system as specified in its rules in accordance with Articles 1 8 , 20 and 21 ;  (f) the participants to the system;  (g) t he common rules and standardised procedures of the system;  (h) the designating authority’s assessment of the system operator’s and system’s compliance with the requirements under this Regulation, including the conditions for designation set out in Article 5.  6. The designating authority shall notify ESMA and the authorities listed in Article 4(2), points (b) , ( d) and (e ), as applicable, without undue delay, of any of the following:  (a) any notifications made by the system operator in accordance with Article 8(2);  (b) any changes to the designation of the system;  (c) any updates to the information listed in paragraph 2.  7. ESMA shall publish in a standardised format the information referred to in paragraph 2 , point (a) to (g) , and any updates thereto in accordance with paragraph 3, point (c ), on its website without undue delay and no later than 2 working days after receipt of that information. ESMA shall specify the date when updates to the information on its website were made and which information was updated .  ESMA shall, without undue delay, provide updated information to EBA and the ESCB, as applicable.  Article 7  Participants in designated systems  1. A system operator may admit one or more types of participants listed in Article 2(1), point (15)(a)(i) to (vii), to the designated system it operates .  A designated system that allows a participant to act in several of the capacities listed in Article 2(1), point (15)(a), or carry out part or all the tasks related to those capacities, shall specify that in its common rules and standardised procedures.  A Member State may, in exceptional circumstances and for the purposes of this Regulation, admit an indirect participant as participant where the indirect participant is known to the system operator and the participants of the system, and where that is warranted on the grounds of systemic risk. That possibility shall, however, not limit the responsibility of the participant through which the indirect participant passes transfer orders to the designated system.  2. A system operator of a designated system may accept a system member to the system only where that member meets all of the following conditions:  (a) it has the capacity and ability to meet the obligations arising from its participation in the system;  (b) it has the capacity and ability to mitigate the risks resulting from its participation in the system;  (c) it complies with the rules of the system.  A system operator of a designated system shall establish admission criteria, differentiating per type of participant where relevant. Such admission criteria shall be non-discriminatory, transparent and objective to ensure fair and open access to the designated system.  A system operator of a designated system shall ensure that the system members comply with the conditions set out in the first subparagraph on an ongoing basis and shall have timely access to the information relevant for such assessment.  3. A participant that enables its clients to access a designated system by transmitting instructions for transfer orders through that system shall inform the system operator of that system thereof . That participant shall have the necessary additional financial resources and operational capacity to perform that activity and shall provide the system operator with the information necessary to identify, monitor and manage relevant concentrations of risk relating to the provision of services to clients.  A participant that enables its clients to access the services of the system shall, upon request from the system operator, inform the system operator about the criteria and arrangements it adopts to enable its clients to access those services. Regardless of such information, that participant shall remain solely responsible with respect to the system operator and other participants to the system for ensuring that its clients comply with their obligations.  Article 8  Duties of a system operator of a designated system  1. The system operator of a designated system shall be responsible for its compliance, and that of the system it operates with the provisions of this Regulation at all times.  2. The system operator shall notify , without undue delay, to the designating authority of any of the following:  (a) any material changes that affect or may affect the system operator’s compliance, and that of the system it operates, with the provisions of this Regulation;  (b) any changes to the list of information provided for in Article 6(2), points (a) to ( g ).  Article 9  Withdrawal of designation  1. A designating authority shall withdraw a designation it granted, where any of the following conditions is met :  (a) the system operator has obtained the designation by making false statements or by any other irregular or unlawful means;  (b) the system operator or the system it operat es , as applicable, no longer compl ies with the requirements of this Regulation and the system operator has not taken the remedial actions requested by the designating authority within a set timeframe;  (c) the system operator or the system it operat es , as applicable, ha s seriously or systemically infringed the requirements laid down in this Regulation.  2. A designating authority shall only decide to withdraw the designation of a system after it has informed the national competent authority and requested an opinion on the appropriateness of withdrawing the designation . The opinion shall be requested from ESMA and the ESCB for the withdrawal of the designation for securities settlement systems and clearing systems, or from EBA and the ESCB, for the withdrawal of the designation for payment systems.  Where ESMA, EBA or the ESCB are of the opinion that the withdrawal of the designation may cause material risks to the financial stability of the Union or in a Member State, it shall inform the designating authority within 10 working days of being informed of a potential withdrawal of a designation under first subparagraph and the designating authority shall, before withdrawing the designation of the system, convene an ad hoc meeting with the national competent authority, the ESCB and, depending on the nature of the system, ESMA or EBA, to cooperate on how to mitigate the risks identified.  Where the designated system is a CSD or a CCP, the designating authority shall not withdraw the designation without the consent of the authority responsible for the supervision of that CSD or CCP.  3.

The third-country system operator shall include in the application all documents and information necessary to demonstrate that it and the system it operates meet the conditions for registration laid down in Article 14 , including the information on the members of that system which are established in the Union, broken down by Member State.  4. An acknowledgement of receipt of the application referred to in paragraph 1 shall be sent to the third-country system operator within two working days of receipt of such application . The registering authorities shall, within 20 working days from receipt of the application, determine whether the application contains the documents and information required pursuant to paragraph 3 .  Where, during the applicable period specified under the first subparagraph, any of the registering authorities concludes that not all documents or information required pursuant to paragraph 3 have been submitted, such authority shall request the third-country system operator to submit such additional documents or information. Where the third-country system operator has failed to comply with any such request in full, any of the registering authorities may reject the application.  5. By the end of the time limits referred to in paragraph 4 , each registering authorit y shall notify ESMA , the third-country system operator and the authorities listed in paragraph 2, points ( a ) , (b) and ( c ) , whether the application is accepted or rejected .  6. After having notified the third-country system operator that the application is accepted, each registering authority that accepted the application shall conduct an assessment of the third-country system operator ’s and the system’s compliance with the conditions for registration laid down in Article 14 within 80 working days of the notification set out in paragraph 5 (‘the assessment period’) .  7. During the assessment period, any registering authority may submit questions to, or request complementary information from, the third-country system operator .  Where the third-country system operator has not responded to the questions or provided the requested information within the deadline set by a requesting registering authority, ESMA may, upon request by any of the registering authorities that accepted the application, extend once the relevant assessment period by a maximum of 10 working days in total where, in their view, any of the questions is material for the assessment. ESMA shall inform the third-country system operator of the extension provided. A registering authority may take a decision on the application in the absence of the third-country system operator’s response.  8. During the assessment period, ESMA and the ESCB for securities settlement systems and clearing systems, and EBA and the ESCB for payments systems, shall take all appropriate measures, including convening ad hoc meetings, to ensure a convergent approach to the decisions to grant or refuse the registration of a third-country system by the registering authorities in their respective Member State.  9. During the assessment process, ESMA , EBA and the ESCB shall promote the regular exchange and discussion among regist ering authorities, to ensure cooperation of the registering authorities in the registration process of such third-country system and provide input to the registering authorities’ assessment process.  10. Within the assessment period, each registering authority shall decide whether to grant or refuse the registration of the third - country system. Each registering authority shall decide to grant the registration only where it is fully satisfied that the third - country system operator and the third - country system comply with the conditions laid down in Article 14 .  11. After taking a decision referred to in paragraph 1 0 , each registering authority shall inform, without undue delay, the third-country system operator, ESMA and the authorities listed in paragraph 2 , points (a) , (b) and (c) a s applicable, of its decision, including a fully reasoned explanation .  12.

TITLE IV  NETTNG AND SETTLEMENT FINALITY  Article 17  Netting and transfer orders  1. Transfer orders and netting, including close-out netting , shall be legally enforceable and binding on third parties, provided that transfer orders were entered into the designated system or registered system before the moment of opening of insolvency proceedings as referred to in Article 2 2 (1), even in the event of insolvency proceedings against any of the following:  (a) a participant in the designated system or registered system;  (b) a participant to an interoperable system to a designated system;  (c) the system operator of an interoperable system to a designated system, which is not a participant.  Transfer orders that are entered into a designated system or registered system after the moment of opening of insolvency proceedings and that are carried out within the business day, as laid down in the common rules and standardised procedures of such system, during which the opening of such proceedings occur, shall be legally enforceable and binding on third parties only where the system operator can prove that, at the time that such transfer orders become irrevocable, it was neither aware, nor should have been aware, of the opening of such proceedings.  2. No law, regulation, rule or practice on the setting aside of contracts and transactions concluded before the moment of opening of insolvency proceedings, as provided for in Article 2 2 (1), shall lead to the unwinding of netting, or the disapplication of close-out netting provision s as referred to in Article 2(1), point (n), of Directive 2002/47/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council .  Article 18  Moment of entry of a transfer order into a designated system  1. The moment of entry of a transfer order into a designated system shall be determined by the common rules and standardised procedures of that system . Such determination shall take account of the receipt and registration of the transfer order by the system .  2. In the case of interoperable systems, each designated system shall determine in its own common rules and standardised procedures the moment of entry of a transfer order into its system, while ensuring, to the extent possible, that the common rules and standardised procedures of all interoperable systems concerned are coordinated. Unless expressly provided for by the common rules and standardised procedures of all the systems that are party to the interoperab ility arrangement , one system's rules on the moment of entry of a transfer order shall not be affected by any rules of the other systems with which it is interoperable.  Article 19  Use of funds and financial instruments  1. The opening of insolvency proceedings against a participant or a system operator of an interoperable system shall not prevent funds or financial instruments available on the settlement account or on accounts holding collateral, including default fund contributions such as contributions to a pre-funded default fund held by a CCP in accordance with Article 42 of Regulation No 648/2012 and margins as r eferred to in Art icle 41 of Regulation No 648/2012 , where applicable, of that participant or system operator from being used to fulfil that participant’s obligations in the designated system, or registered system in the Member State where the participant is established, or in an interoperab ility arrangement on the business day of the opening of the insolvency proceedings.  2. Such a participant’s credit facility connected to the designated system or registered system, as applicable, shall be usable against available, existing collateral security to fulfil that participant’s obligations in the designated system, or in the registered system in the Member State where the participant is established, or in an interoperab ility arrangement .  Article 20  The moment of irrevocability of transfer orders  1. Each designated system shall determine the specific moment where, in its system, a participant or a third party cannot revoke a transfer order. Such determination shall take account of the moment when a transfer order that entered into the system was confirmed by the system and where the processing of the order could not be reversed.  2. In the case of interoperable systems, each system shall determine in its own common rules and standardised procedures the moment of irrevocability, while ensuring, to the extent possible, that the common rules and standardised procedures of all interoperable systems concerned are coordinated. Unless expressly provided for by the common rules and standardised procedures of all the systems that are party to an interoperability arrangement, one system's rules on the moment of irrevocability shall not be affected by any rules of the other systems with which it is interoperable.  Article 21  Final settlement  1. Settlement shall be final when the discharge of the obligations of the parties to a transaction is completed in an unconditional and irrevocable manner as determined by the common rules and standardised procedures of each designated system, in accordance with the applicable law for transfer of ownership and other rights. A designated system that is based on DLT shall implement mechanisms guaranteeing deterministic and legally enforceable finality moments.  2. In the case of interoperable systems, each system shall determine in its own common rules and standardised procedures the moment of final settlement. Each system operator shall ensure, to the extent possible, that the rules of all interoperable systems concerned are coordinated. Unless expressly provided for by the common rules and standardised procedures of all the systems that are party to an interoperability arrangement, one system's common rules and standardised procedures on the moment of final settlement shall not be affected by any common rules or standardised procedures of the other systems with which it is interoperable.  3. ESMA may, in close cooperation with the ESCB, for clearing and securities settlement systems not operated by a CSD, and taking into account the specificities of different types of systems , and the mechanics of th os e system s , develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the rules for determining all of the following:  (a) the moment of entry of transfer orders into a designated system, referred to in Article 18(1);  (b) for DLT-based designated systems, when and how the moment of entry of a transfer order into the system , referred to in Article 18(1), occurs when a transaction is recorded in the ledger according to the system’s consensus rules;  (c) the moment , referred to in Article 20(1) , in which a transfer order that entered into the designated system cannot be rev oked ;  (d) for DLT-based designated systems, how the moment , referred to in Article 20(1) , in which a transfer order that entered into the system cannot be revoked by a participant or by a third party coincides with the point at which consensus is final and the record cannot be reversed under the technical protocol of that system;  (e) the moment of final settlement referred to in paragraph 1 ;  (f) for DLT-based designated systems, how the moment of final settlement referred to in paragraph 1 could be defined for probabilistic or layered finality models, which may not meet the absolute legal certainty but may still be able to achieve legal certainty depending on the structure and rules of the system.  The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.  4. EBA may, in close cooperation with the ESCB, and taking into account the specificities of different types of payments systems and the mechanics of the system s , develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the rules for determining all of the following:  (a) the moment of entry of transfer orders into a designated system referred to in Article 18(1);  (b) for DLT-based designated systems, when and how the moment of entry of a transfer order into the system , referred to in Article 18(1), occurs when a transaction is recorded in the ledger according to the system’s consensus rules;  (c) the moment , referred to in Article 20(1), in which a transfer order that entered into the designated system cannot be revoked;  (d) for DLT-based designated systems, when and how the specific moment in which a transfer order that entered int o the system cannot be revoked by a participant or by a third party coincides with the point at which consensus is final and the record cannot be reversed under the technical protocol of that system;  (e) the moment of final settlement referred to in paragraph 1 ;  (f) for DLT-based designated systems,  how the moment of final settlement , referred to in paragraph 1, could be defined for probabilistic or layered finality models, which may not meet the absolute legal certainty but may still be able to achieve legal certainty depending on the structure and rules of the system.  The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.  TITLE V  PROVISIONS CONCERNING INSOLVENCY PROCEEDINGS  Article 22  The moment of opening of insolvency proceedings  1.

Such proceedings shall not have retroactive effect on the rights and obligations of a participant in an interoperable system, or on a system operator of an interoperable system where such system operator is not a participant.  Article 24  Law governing the rights and obligations of participants  In the event of insolvency proceedings being opened against a participant in a system, the rights and obligations arising from, or in connection with, the participation of that participant shall be determined by the law governing that system.  TITLE VI  INSULATION OF THE RIGHTS OF HOLDERS OF COLLATERAL SECURITY FROM THE EFFECTS OF THE INSOLVENCY OF THE PROVIDER  Article 25  Collateral security  1. The rights of a system operator or of a participant to collateral security provided to them in connection with a designated system, a registered system for its participants established in the Member States where the system is registered, or an interoperab ility arrangement , and the rights of central banks of the Member States or the European Central Bank to collateral security provided to them, shall not be affected by insolvency proceedings against any of the following:  (a) the participant in the designated or the registered system concerned or in an interoperab ility arrangement ;  (b) the system operator of an interoperable system which is not a participant;  (c) a counterparty to the central bank of a Member State;  (d) a counterparty to the European Central Bank;  (e) any third party which provided the collateral security.  Such collateral security may be realised for the satisfaction of those rights.  The rights of a system operator to the collateral security it provided to another system operator in connection with an interoperability arrangement shall not be affected by insolvency proceedings against the receiving system operator.  2. The rights of participants, system operators, a central bank of a Member State, the European Central Bank and of any nominee, agent or third party acting on their behalf with respect to the financial instruments, including rights in those financial instruments, which are provided as collateral security that is legally recorded on a register, including where recorded on a distri buted ledger, account or centralised deposit system located in a Member State, shall be governed by the law of that Member State.

FRAMEWORK OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE  1.1. Title of the proposal/initiative  Proposal for a Regulation (EU) 2025/XXX of the European Parliament and of the Council on settlement finality and repealing Directive 98/26/EC and amending Directive 2002/47/EC on financial collateral arrangements  1.2. Policy area(s) concerned  Internal market – financial services  1.3. Objective(s)  1.3.1. General objective(s)  The initiative is part of the Savings and Investment Union which aims to foster a seamless, integrated capital market across the EU by strengthening the supervisory framework, addressing regulatory fragmentation and ensuring better integration and deepening of capital markets throughout the Union to realise the Savings and Investments Union’s full potential. The objective is to remove barriers to cross-border activity.  1.3.2. Specific objective(s)  Specific objective No 1 – harmonising the provisions on settlement finality  In order to achieve harmonisation of the provisions on settlement finality as well as reduce legal uncertainty related to diverging transposition in Member States, the current Settlement Finality Directive is turned into a Regulation.  Specific objective No 2 - modernising the provisions on settlement finality to recognise new technologies and financial developments  The proposed amendments aim at ensuring to maintain the technological neutrality of the settlement finality legislation by clarifying where needed to cater for the use of new technologies and financial developments.  1.3.3. Expected result(s) and impact  Specify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.  Enhanced harmonisation  Enhanced legal certainty, amongst others regarding the use of new technologies  Reduced cross-border market barriers  1.3.4. Indicators of performance  Specify the indicators for monitoring progress and achievements.  Core set indicator – specific objective No 1  Enhanced cross-border participation in SFR designated systems, measured by number of EU participants in a system that is not governed by the law of a Member State where the participant is headquartered. To be compared: The number of EU participants headquartered in another Member State than which law is governing the system at the time of entry into force of the SFR with 5 years after the mandatory SFR designation enters into force.  Core set indicator – specifc objective No 2  The number of SFR designated systems using new technologies (such as DLT) 5 years after the mandatory SFR designation enters into force.  1.4. The proposal/initiative relates to:   a new action   a new action following a pilot project / preparatory action 40   the extension of an existing action   a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action  1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative  1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative  All systems that are required or wish to be designated under settlement finality legislation in the EU, need to comply with the harmonised requirements set out under the Settlement Finality Regulation. EU national competent authorities as well as the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the European Banking Authority (EBA) and European System of Central Banks (ESCB) are required to implement and provide guidance on the examination of different areas related to the designation process of systems.  1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, greater effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this section 'added value of EU involvement' is the value resulting from EU action, that is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.  Reasons for action at EU level (ex-ante) There’s a compelling EU dimension as national solutions cannot adequately address the cross-border and fragmented nature and the regulatory divergences of EU capital markets. The EU needs the scale to compete globally and finance our needs and such scale can only be achieved at EU level. EU-level actions are best positioned to remove cross-border regulatory barriers, ensuring a level playing field across the EU, catalysing market integration, enhancing market scale, efficiency and competitiveness and providing a unified regulatory framework that national actions cannot achieve individually. The initiative will be based on Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. This provision is the legal base of the legal acts to be amended by this proposal.  Expected generated EU added value (ex-post) Enhanced harmonisation across the EU and thus reduced market fragmentation as well as reduced cross-border market barriers. Greater legal certainty, amongst others regarding the use of new technologies.  1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past  The use of a Directive as an instrument to provide settlement finality in the past has shown that diverging implementation in Member States led to a fragmented market creating cross-border barriers. Therefore, turning the Settlement Finality Directive into a Regulation seems to be the right instrument to ensure greater harmonisation and reduce as a consequence cross-border barriers.  1.5.4. Compatibility with the multiannual financial framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments  The proposal is compatible with the Commission proposal of 16 July 2025 for a multiannual financial framework for years 2028-34, specifically as regards the budget of individual agencies. Therefore, figures are indicative pending the final adoption of the MFF.  1.5.5. Assessment of the different available financing options, including scope for redeployment  Additional resources are necessary for agencies to work on the SFR mandates and assist ensuring consistent application of SFR requirements across Member States. In order to ensure greater consistency regarding the designation of EU systems as well as registration of third-country systems, ESMA and EBA are in particular supposed to assist Member States in their assessments of i) systems applying for SFR designation and ii) third-country systems applying for registration, to ensure a convergent approach. These are recurring tasks which require an expertise in the area of insolvency law as well as regarding financial market infrastructures.  The fee option is practically unworkable as fees could not be levied on system operators as the designation work is done by Member States while ESMA’s and EBA’s roles are to ensure convergence and provide guidance where needed. In addition, such an approach would also be difficult to justify, as the considered measures are not directly linked to supervisory powers, but part of developing the regulatory framework.  The scope for redeployment was assessed. The additional resources envisaged would cover only partially the need of ESMA and EBA during the initial phase for the work required under the SFR to develop a series of Delegated Acts, as well as for ESMA to establish and run the central database as required under Article 26 of the SFR. Since this central database is established under an earlier mandate, i.e. Regulation (EU) 2024/2987 (‘EMIR 3’), the costs associated with the set-up and ongoing maintenance of the central database under the SFR only reflect the relative increase in those costs in order for the central database to be implemented as required under the SFR. These costs are incorporated into the figures provided in the Master Regulation document related to the “ESMA Central Database and supervisory platform for CCPs, CSDs and TVs” (see Section 4.3 of the Master Regulation, as well as Parts D and E of the section on Specific Assumptions in the Annex of that Regulation) and are thus not presented separately here. Once these have been implemented, the resulting new recurring tasks at both ESMA and EBA will require one FTE in each agency, in particular to cover the work on assisting Member States regarding new designations and re-designations as well as registrations.  1.6. Duration of the proposal/initiative and of its financial impact   limited duration  –  in effect from [DD/MM]YYYY to [DD/MM]YYYY  –  financial impact from YYYY to YYYY for commitment appropriations and from YYYY to YYYY for payment appropriations.   unlimited duration  – Implementation with a start-up period in 2028  – followed by full-scale operation.  1.7. Method(s) of budget implementation planned 41   Direct management by the Commission  –  by its departments, including by its staff in the Union delegations;  –  by the executive agencies   Shared management with the Member States   Indirect management by entrusting budget implementation tasks to:  –  third countries or the bodies they have designated  –  international organisations and their agencies (to be specified)  –  the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund  –  bodies referred to in Articles 70 and 71 of the Financial Regulation  –  public law bodies  –  bodies governed by private law with a public service mission to the extent that they are provided with adequate financial guarantees  –  bodies governed by the private law of a Member State that are entrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership and that are provided with adequate financial guarantees  –  bodies or persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in the common foreign and security policy pursuant to Title V of the Treaty on European Union, and identified in the relevant basic act  –   bodies established in a Member State, governed by the private law of a Member State or Union law and eligible to be entrusted, in accordance with sector-specific rules, with the implementation of Union funds or budgetary guarantees, to the extent that such bodies are controlled by public law bodies or by bodies governed by private law with a public service mission, and are provided with adequate financial guarantees in the form of joint and several liability by the controlling bodies or equivalent financial guarantees and which may be, for each action, limited to the maximum amount of the Union support.  Comments  2. MANAGEMENT MEASURES  2.1. Monitoring and reporting rules  As decentralised agencies, the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) fully comply with the legal and operational requirements of the Union laws in terms of monitoring and reporting rules.  In line with already existing arrangements, the ESAs prepare regular reports on their activity (including internal reporting to Senior Management, reporting to Boards and the production of the annual report), and are subject to audits by the Court of Auditors and the Commission's Internal Audit Service on their use of resources and performance.  Monitoring and reporting of the actions included in the proposal will be covered and comply with the already existing requirements, as well as with any new requirements resulting from this proposal.  2.2. Management and control system(s)  2.2.1. Justification of the budget implementation method(s), the funding implementation mechanism(s), the payment modalities and the control strategy proposed  The European Supervisory Agencies for financial services (EBA, EIOPA, ESMA), are decentralised regulatory agencies pursuant to Art. 70 Financial Regulation.  Management and control systems of ESMA and EBA are provided for in Chapter VI of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 and No 1093/2010 establishing them, in combination with the applicable framework financial Regulation (EU) 2019/715 as endorsed by each Authority.  In accordance with Article 30 of their respective Financial Regulations, the Authorities must ensure that the appropriate standards are met in all areas of the internal control framework which should be based upon best international practices and on the Internal Control Framework laid down by the Commission for its own departments.  In accordance with Article 70.5 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 of the European Parliament and of the Council (the Financial Regulation), the Internal Auditor of the Commission is also the Internal Auditor of ESMA and EBA. In particular, in accordance with Article 78.3 of the Financial Regulations of both agencies, the Commission’s Internal Auditor (i.e. the Internal Audit Service) is responsible for:  (a) assessing the suitability and effectiveness of internal management systems and the performance of departments in implementing programmes and actions by reference to the risks associated with them;  (b) assessing the efficiency and effectiveness of the internal control and audit systems applicable to each operation for implementation of the budget of the Union body.  These responsibilities of the Internal Audit Service will also extend to the new tasks to be implemented by ESMA and EBA as laid down by the proposed legislation.  As well as the work of the Internal Audit Service, ESMA and EBA are both subject to external audit including by the European Court of Auditors, which in accordance with Article 104 of the Financial Regulations of ESMA, shall each year prepare specific annual reports on ESMA in line with the requirements of Article 287(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  2.2.2. Information concerning the risks identified and the internal control system(s) set up to mitigate them  In relation to the legal, economic, efficient and effective use of appropriations resulting from the actions to be carried out in the context of this proposal by ESMA and EBA, this initiative does not bring about new significant risks that would not be covered by an existing internal control framework.  2.2.3. Estimation and justification of the cost-effectiveness of the controls (ratio between the control costs and the value of the related funds managed), and assessment of the expected levels of risk of error (at payment & at closure)  Management and control systems are provided in Regulation (EU) 1095/2010 and and 1093/2010 which govern the functioning of respectively ESMA and EBA. These are deemed to be cost effective. The initiative will have no significant effect on costs to be supported by the Member States, ESMA or the EBA from that angle. Impacts on risks of error rates are expected to be very low.  Historically DG FISMA’s costs of the overall supervision of an Authority such as ESMA or the EBA have been estimated at 0.5% of the annual contributions paid to them. Such costs include, for example but not exclusively, the costs related to the assessment of the annual programming and budget, the participation of DG FISMA's representatives in Management Boards, Boards of Supervisors and related preparatory work.  2.3. Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities  For the purpose of combating fraud, corruption and any other illegal activity, the provisions of Regulation (EU, Euratom) N°883/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 September 2013 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) apply to the ESAs without any restriction. The ESAs have a dedicated anti-fraud strategy and resulting action plan. The ESAs' actions in the area of anti-fraud will be compliant with the Financial Regulation, OLAF’s fraud prevention policies, the provisions provided by the Commission Anti-Fraud Strategy (COM(2019)196) as well as the Common Approach on EU decentralised agencies (July 2012) and the related roadmap. In addition, the Regulations establishing the ESAs as well as the ESAs' Financial Regulations set out the provisions on implementation and control of the ESAs' budgets and applicable financial rules, including those aimed at preventing fraud and irregularities.  3.

For this, it is estimated that 2 skilled and permanent FTEs would be necessary to carry out these tasks, 1 at EBA and 1 at ESMA. These tasks require a good knowledge on insolvency law as well as on financial market infrastructure legislation. The FTEs need to be able to assess the reasoning of Member States’ competent authorities as to how the compatibility of the rules of a system is in line with the (national) insolvency law and ensure that Member States have designated EU systems in a consistent way, also taking into account sectorial legislation. This is the case for EU systems as well as third-country systems.  ESMA is required to establish and run over time an electronic central database as required under Article 26 of the SFR. The central database facilitates the exchange of information and documents relevant to the recipients under this Regulation, including the designation and registration of EU and third-country systems, as well as the publication of certain information. Article 26 also provides for access for the competent authorities, registration authorities and national competent authorities for payment, settlement and clearing systems. Given the EBA, in close cooperation with the ESCB, is responsible for payments systems, central banks and the EBA will also require access.  The central database will require ESMA to set up appropriate IT infrastructure to ensure the safe, efficient and effective transmission and storage of the information, documents, and communication between relevant stakeholders (e.g. designated systems, competent authorities , etc.) as prescribed under the SFR. The central database required under the SFR should be the same system as that required under Article 17c of EMIR , Article 21a of the CSDR , Article 38ea of MiFIR, and Article 35c of the ESMA Regulation . Since this central database is established under an earlier mandate, i.e. Regulation (EU) 2024/2987 (‘EMIR 3’), the costs associated with the set-up and ongoing maintenance of the central database under the SFR should only reflect the relative increase in those costs in order for the central database to be implemented as required under the SFR. This includes the added cost of facilitating access for the additional stakeholders required to have access to the central database under the SFR (approximately 60 entities), as well as the cost of storage for the additional information, documentation, and communications that would be kept in and/or transmitted via the database. These costs are incorporated into the figures provided in the Master Regulation document 46 related to the “ESMA Central Database and supervisory platform for CCPs, CSDs and TVs” (see Section 4.3 of the Master Regulation, as well as Parts D and E of the section on Specific Assumptions in the Annex of that Regulation) and are thus not presented separately here.  Cost estimates:  The calculation for the costs of are based on DG BUDG guidance for the category of personnel: Contract agent, based on the average cost of a temporary agent in 2025 (i.e. €0.084 million) and featuring:  An inflation rate of 2% starting in 2027;  A salary correction coefficient for Paris, where both ESMA and the EBA are located, of 114,2%;  An amount of 30.000 EUR/year corresponding to operating expenditure, mainly building and IT related costs, is included, as per 2025 standard price, subject to an inflation of 2%.  The above expenditures will be financed: 1/ for EBA, up to 40% via a Commission subsidy and up to 60% by the national competent authorities (NCA), in accordance with this ESAs’ founding Regulation; 2/ for ESMA, up to 50% via a Commission subsidy and up to 50% by the national competent authorities (NCA) strictly as it concerns new additional tasks required by the SIU package.

This proposal seeks to replace the existing Settlement Finality Directive, ensuring that once transactions are entered into a designated system, they cannot be reversed, even if a participant becomes insolvent. The primary goals are to provide legal certainty, reduce systemic risks, and facilitate smoother financial operations across the EU. This initiative is part of a broader effort to create a Savings and Investments Union, making Europe a more attractive destination for investment by addressing the need for risk capital in strategic sectors.

The proposal aims to eliminate legal uncertainties and reduce costs associated with cross-border financial transactions, fostering a more integrated and resilient European capital market. It seeks to enhance liquidity, spur innovation, and provide better financial products and services to EU citizens. The existing Settlement Finality Directive has faced challenges due to its national transposition, resulting in significant divergences that undermine its effectiveness in fostering a coherent and integrated European post-trade landscape. Member States have adopted different approaches to the designation of systems, creating inconsistencies in the scope of protection available to participants, with varying definitions and treatment of participants and indirect participants.

To address these issues, the proposal supports the correct and safe functioning of the single market, safeguarding competition and preserving financial stability. It introduces a common definition and harmonized approach to system designation, with the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) playing a key role.",

CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  Reviving the EU’s economy and strengthening i t s international position are central to the European Commission ’s mandate. As stated in the Draghi and Letta reports 1 and in the 2024-2029 Commission political guidelines 2 , urgent action is required to improve economic performance and to ensure that the EU can decide its own future. The Competitiveness Compass 3 sets out a comprehensive plan to streng th en the EU’s econom y and harness its potential , with the Savings and Investments Union (SIU) acting as a key enabler for this plan . In March 2025, the Commission unveiled its S IU strategy 4 . It aims to make it easier for citizens to grow their wealth by investing in capital markets, to increase the investment capacity in the EU, and to integrate the EU’s capital markets . By breaking down barriers in financial markets and facilitating cross-border capital flows, the SIU strategy can support the EU economy, stimulate job creation, and enhance competitiveness .  The need for urgent action has been widely recognised at the highest political level , including in statements and calls to action from the European Parliament 5 , the European Council 6 , the Eurogroup 7 , the Euro Summit 8 , and the European Central Bank (ECB) 9 . T he International Monetary Fund (‘IMF’) 10 and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (‘OECD’) 11 have also called for action to address remaining barriers to financial market integration .  Implementing the SIU requires comprehensive policy measures that will have an impact on various aspects of the EU’s financial system, with a holistic approach encompassing both the capital markets and the banking sector. These measures are grouped into four interconnected pillars: (i) citizens and savings, (ii) investments and financing, (iii) market integration and scale; and (iv) efficient supervision. This legislative initiative focuses on market integration and scale, and efficient supervision.  This legislative initiative focuses on barriers stemming from the lack of harmonisation of EU rules and supervisory approaches resulting in the fragmentation and underperformance of EU capital markets. These barriers hinder market-driven efforts to expand business and build scale across the single market through cross-border activities. They also hinder the use of innovative digital technologies in three areas that are essential for the smooth and efficient functioning of EU capital markets, namely trading, post-trading and asset management.  Despite the harmonisation of regulatory frameworks and the existence of financial services passports, persistent fragmentation as a result of these barriers limits the potential benefits of the EU's single market. These barriers arise from differences in regulatory approaches, often reflecting the use of discretions in the transposition and interpretation of EU directives and varying approaches to supervision. These barriers unnecessarily complicate the cross-border activities of financial market participants. As a result, either they cannot fully benefit from economies of scale and improved operational efficiency or there is no sufficient incentive for them to facilitate cross-border investments. This raises costs, delays time to market, restricts the choice of financial products and services available to businesses and the public, and makes those products and services more expensive.  This initiative also emphasises the importance of technological developments and innovation in the financial sector. Regulatory barriers are hindering the uptake and use of newer-generation technologies, such as distributed ledger technology (DLT) and tokenisation of financial instruments. Such technologies have the potential to improve financial services for people and businesses.  Divergent supervisory practices can also act as a barrier to capital market integration, as financial market participants operating across borders must manage different requirements across the single market. This fragmentation of supervisory practices creates additional costs, increased complexity and legal uncertainty for operators, especially those who intend to do business and invest across the EU. The legal uncertainty and the uneven playing field that this creates makes the EU a less appealing investment destination.  Objectives of the proposal  The general objective of this initiative is to integrate EU capital markets and improve the functioning of the EU single market in financial services for the benefit of investors, businesses and the wider EU economy. This contributes to the SIU’s core objective to enable access to a wider range of financial opportunities for investors and businesses and to mobilise savings for productive investment.  The initiative will contribute to achieving the general objective through the following specific objectives.  Enable further market integration and scale effects  The proposed amendments aim to remove barriers to integration in the core sectors of trading, post-trading and asset management, and improve the ability of market actors to operate more seamlessly across Member States, thereby enabling market integration and scale. It will foster competition, ensuring that scale benefits are effectively passed on to end users.  Enable integrated supervision  More efficient and harmonised supervision is essential to integrate EU capital markets. As progress is made towards deeper capital market integration, it is crucial for the EU supervisory framework to evolve in lock step. The initiative therefore aims to address the shortcomings and inefficiencies in the current supervisory framework, by tackling inconsistencies and complexities arising from fragmented national supervisory approaches. It aims to make supervision more effective, more conducive to cross-border activities, and more responsive to emerging risks, while reducing unnecessary burdens on firms. For certain significant and cross-border entities in the areas of trading and post-trading, and for entities in new areas like crypto-asset service providers, pooling supervision at EU level can promote market integration and more efficient functioning of the capital markets. For large asset management groups and investment funds, stronger convergence and coordination of supervision at EU level will remove barriers and increase cross-border activities. Across the board, the initiative aims to strengthen the use and effectiveness of the supervisory convergence tools of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), and introduce new tools, thereby supporting a single market for financial service.  Facilitate innovation  The proposed amendments also aims to remove regulatory obstacles to DLT-based innovation, with a view to creating a framework to enable the use of new technologies in the provision of financial services. For innovation to thrive, both the DLT Pilot Regime and the standard rulebook should allow the industry to use DLT to bring efficient solutions to the market, while ensuring that associated risks are mitigated. By removing these barriers, the proposed amendments also aim to increase competition in the area of trading and post-trading services, which will lead to improved market outcomes and enhancing capital market efficiency.  Achieve simplification  The review of specific legislative files presents an opportunity to simplify by reducing administrative burdens. The package aims to streamline regulatory requirements, making cross-border activities more cost-effective. Simplification is pursued in several ways: moving certain provisions from directives to regulations; narrowing the scope for nationally imposed ‘gold-plating’ measures; refining Level 2 empowerments; streamlining overlapping, costly and inefficient supervisory arrangements; and more generally removing barriers in EU and national frameworks for market operators and investors.  The market integration and supervision package comprises three legislative proposals, namely: proposals for a Master Regulation and a Master Directive which amend several existing pieces of EU capital market legislation, and a proposal for a Settlement Finality Regulation, which amends the Financial Collateral Directive and repeals the Settlement Finality Directive.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  The proposed amendments in this package are consistent with existing provisions in the field of financial services. They aim to foster stronger market integration and achieve efficiency gains by: (i) removing barriers to cross-border activity and innovation, (ii) increasing regulatory and supervisory convergence; and (iii) strengthening supervisory capacity in the relevant sectors. These amendments are consistent with the goals of competition, efficient functioning of the single market in financial services, and promoting the freedom to provide services across the EU, without compromising financial stability, market integrity or investor protection. This ensures that the EU financial market remains safe and globally attractive. Implementing these amendments as a package allows to ensure consistency across sectoral legislations under review. The proposed amendments also seek to address shortcomings and inefficiencies in the current supervisory framework by tackling the inconsistencies and complexities arising from fragmented national supervisory approaches.  • Consistency with other Union policies  This proposal is consistent with the core objective of the SIU strategy, which is to enable access to a wider range of financial opportunities for investors and businesses, thereby mobilising savings for productive investment. This proposal is interlinked with other initiatives included in the SIU strategy, for instance the initiatives on pensions, on increasing retail participation in capital markets, and on market-based financing of the real economy. These initiatives are designed to reinforce each other and collectively contribute to the overall goals. Other measures in the SIU strategy, such as the financial literacy strategy, the recommendation on savings and investment accounts, the measure to promote equity investments, including through legislative programmes, and the measures on supplementary pensions will be less effective if the barriers to further integration of EU capital markets are not removed and continue to impose high costs on investors and businesses.  The proposal is also consistent with the EU policy to enhance Europe’s competitiveness, the strategy outlined in the Competitiveness Compass, the single market strategy, the EU start-up and scale-up strategy, and the Communication on a Simpler and Faster Europe.  The proposed amendments will boost the attractiveness of EU capital markets, thereby helping to finance the EU’s priorities. They will do so, in particular: (i) by further harmonising the rules; (ii) making it easier for trading venues, financial market infrastructures and investment funds to operate and provide services across borders, thus reducing costs for all market participants; and (iii) as regards innovation, by ensuring that the DLT Pilot Regime, which is designed to support DLT-based innovation in financial services, and post-trade legislation remain fit for purpose for innovation.  This package is also consistent with, and will contribute to, the Commission’s simplification agenda and the single market strategy. It will do so, in particular: (i) by harmonising and streamlining some of the rules applicable to trading, post-trading and investment funds; and (ii) by moving part of the requirements applicable to those sectors from Directives to Regulations.  By removing barriers to further integration of capital markets, the measures under this initiative complement other EU initiatives, such as the 28th regime. By streamlining cross-border offering of trading, post trading services and asset management services, thereby simplifying access to public markets, this option enhances the ability of companies operating under a 28th regime to leverage the benefits of a more integrated EU capital market even more effectively.  Finally, this initiative is in line with the Commission’s d igital f inance s trategy 12 , which support s the deployment of new technologies in financial services , by ambitious ly adapt ing the existing rule s to accommodate new technologies, such as DLT.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) confers on the European Parliament and the Council the competence to adopt measures for the approximation of the provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States which relate to the establishment and functioning of the internal market. Article 114 TFEU allows the EU to take measures to eliminate existing barriers to the exercise of fundamental freedoms and to prevent such barriers from emerging. This includes barriers that make it difficult for economic operators, including investors, to take full advantage of the benefits of the internal market.  The amendments contribute to the correct and safe functioning of the single market, safeguard competition and preserve incentives for innovation. Consequently, the appropriate legal basis is Article 114 TFEU.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  Under Article 4 of TFEU, EU action to complete the internal market must be appraised in light of the subsidiarity principle set out in Article 5(3) of the Treaty on European Union. According to the principle of subsidiarity, action should be taken at EU level only when the objectives of the proposed action cannot be achieved sufficiently by Member States alone and thus require action at EU level.  The proposed amendments comply with the subsidiarity principle. They aim to tackle the existing barriers to the cross-border provision of services preventing the creation of a genuine single market for capital.  National action alone cannot resolve these challenges. The diversity of Member States’ legal frameworks, supervisory traditions and market structures means that reforms undertaken individually would not deliver the necessary convergence of regulatory and supervisory standards and market practices. Action at EU level is therefore required to remove those barriers, enhance market integration and facilitate market integration.  • Proportionality  The initiative involves a broad review of the rules on trading, post-trading, asset management and investment funds to harmonise and streamline the requirements for businesses. This includes easing some requirements for cross-border groups and services provided on a cross-border basis, under a single license. In the settlement area, interconnectedness between central securities depositories (CSDs) would also be improved. The review also includes amendments to post-trade legislation to make it more technologically neutral, and to the DLT Pilot Regime (DLTPR), to expand its scope and scale, and to make it more flexible and proportionate. Investment funds would gain immediate and full single market access upon authorisation, which would enable them to operate more efficiently across borders. On supervision, the amendments aim to strengthen the use and effectiveness of supervisory convergence tools and powers, focusing on ESMA and its governance. Supervisory powers would also be transferred to ESMA for the most significant and cross-border market infrastructures (central counterparties, CSDs and trading venues) and for all crypto-asset service providers (CASPs). ESMA would also have a reinforced role in fostering supervisory convergence for undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) and alternative investment funds (AIFs) marketed on a cross-border basis.  To the extent that divergences in the application of EU rules as well as differences between Member States’ national laws create market inefficiencies and burdens, the amendments will create a more harmonised and proportionate application of the EU rules for cross-border activities.  • Choice of the instrument  It is proposed to implement the measures through a proposal for a Regulation amending the following acts: the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (MiFIR), the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR), the Central Securities Depository Regulation (CSDR), the Cross-Border Distribution Regulation (CBDR), the DLT Pilot Regime Regulation, the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation and the ESMA Regulation. To ensure appropriate alignment with the substantive amendments in those Regulations, amendments will also be made to the Securities Financing Transactions Regulation and the CCP Recovery and Resolution Regulation. A Regulation is the most appropriate legal instrument because the proposed amendments are inter-linked and are part of a broader political effort to create a single market for capital by harmonising the rules and removing barriers to cross-border activities in the financial sectors that form the backbone of capital markets financing. Combining the amendments in a legislative package helps ensure that the overall text is consistent.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT  • Ex-post evaluations / fitness checks of existing legislation  Currently, there are no effective solutions to ensure cross-border provision of services in the sectors that fall within the scope of this package or they are hampered by divergent national rules. Moreover, the EU rules need to be updated to make it easier to provide financial services using new technologies, in particular DLT, which can improve the efficiency of the capital markets.  Non-aligned supervisory practices and weak supervisory convergence tools and powers at EU level exacerbate these issues. These barriers lead to market inefficiencies, limited economies of scale, reduced liquidity in capital markets, increased costs for investors, restricted access to a broader investor base across borders, and higher capital costs for EU companies, ultimately undermining the productivity and competitiveness of the EU economy.  In the trading area, rules governing trading venues are not fully harmonised, and subject to a certain degree of national discretion. Passporting opportunities for regulated markets are not explicitly spelled out, leaving room for Member States to set additional requirements in their national laws. Differences in transposition in national laws and the possibility for additional gold-plating by Member States makes the overall regulatory landscape complex, in particular for cross-border entities or groups. It creates legal uncertainty and an uneven playing field among Member States, preventing the emergence of trading structures that operate in several Member States. To address barriers linked to supervisory fragmentation, the relevant provisions of the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation should be amended to introduce direct EU-level supervision of certain trading venues.  In the post-trading area, settlement markets need to be more integrated and greater use needs to be made of T2S to facilitate cross-border activity by issuers, CSDs and investors. Even though settlement is governed by a Regulation (the Central Securities Depository Regulation), regulatory barriers to cross-border settlement persist. For instance, national legislation may impose additional restrictions on the freedom of issuance beyond those included in the Central Securities Depository Regulation provisions. Additionally, the passporting framework, intended to facilitate cross-border operations, is considered costly and burdensome for CSDs. The Central Securities Depository Regulation does not adequately consider market infrastructure groups from an operational, regulatory and supervisory perspective. This makes it difficult for them to reap the benefits of consolidation and achieve economies of scale. There is therefore a need to harmonise requirements for cross-border businesses and to streamline requirements and reduce operational complexity in the EU settlement infrastructures (i.e. CSDs, including the T2S costs passed on by CSDs), to gain efficiency and reduce costs. Moreover, the Central Securities Depository Regulation needs to be amended to make it more technologically neutral and address legal uncertainty around key concepts, definitions and requirements that have not kept pace with technological advances. To address barriers linked to supervisory fragmentation, the relevant provisions of the Central Securities Depository Regulation should be amended to introduce direct EU-level supervision of certain post-trading infrastructures.  In the asset management area, the marketing of UCITS funds and AIFs is mainly governed by Directives, which allow for national discretions in many areas. The cross-border marketing of UCITS and AIFs is currently time-consuming and administratively difficult to manage. Many Member States have country-specific requirements for marketing communications and disclosures in fund documentation, as well as specific administrative and operational requirements (such as additional marketing rules, regulatory fees, reporting obligations, and local physical presence requirements). These hinder the development of an effective EU passport for investment funds in the Union. Furthermore, the Cross-Border Distribution Regulation (the CBDR) acknowledges that Member States have different rules on regulatory fees and charges and provides optionality on the ex-ante verification of marketing communications. There is therefore a need to significantly reduce diverging national practices in the marketing of funds across the Union, as well as presenting the rules relating to the cross-border distribution of funds in a more efficient way, i.e. within the same legal text, in order to foster greater harmonisation in the cross-border marketing of UCITS and AIFs. This approach involves amendments to the CBDR and transferring certain provisions (with amendments) from the Directives 2009/65/EC and 2011/61/EU into the CBDR. To reduce supervisory fragmentation and improve collaboration between national competent authorities, ESMA’s role in addressing cross-border barriers and resolving disagreements between the home and host national authorities should be reinforced.  In the innovation area, there are two main obstacles related to implementing DLT-based solutions in Europe. First, the DLT Pilot Regime Regulation places a heavy compliance burden on small businesses and start-ups, particularly due to relying on extensive requirements in the Central Securities Depository Regulation and Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, that may not be well-suited to the gradual scaling-up of operations and the specific characteristics of DLT. The DLT Pilot Regime Regulation also imposes stringent limitations on the scope and scale of the activities of participants in the pilot regime. It does so, for example, by introducing aggregate limits to the activity of an infrastructure operating under the Regulation and restricting the type and issuance size of assets that can be intermediated under the Regulation. Furthermore, market participants do not have clarity about the long-term prospects for the DLT Pilot Regime, given its experimental nature and the time limitations set out in the Regulation. Second, beyond the shortcomings of Europe’s bespoke framework for DLT, the standard (non-DLTPR) regulatory frameworks, in particular post-trade legislation do not currently provide legal certainty for those wishing to use DLT outside the DLTPR. These uncertainties increase compliance risks and costs for market participants willing to explore innovative business models.  On supervision, there are two main issues. First, supervision of financial entities is largely conducted at national level. This results in a fragmented supervisory landscape that creates barriers to cross-border activities because of divergent application of EU law and divergent supervisory practices, approaches and requirements. Enforcement actions, such as infringements, can address specific instances of non-compliance, and peer reviews aim to strengthen supervisory convergence, but they are not sufficient to address the underlying issues of non-aligned supervisory practices. Second, there are limited mandates and tools available at the EU level to enforce consistent application of EU rules and adopt a unified single market supervisory approach. The use of supervisory convergence tools remains sporadic. They have limitations, are not used consistently and can be difficult to use due to procedural constraints, and lack of enforceability.  • Stakeholder consultations  The following consultation activities have helped to shape the content of this proposal:  · European Commission ‘Call for evidence on the Savings and Investments Union: Fostering integration and scale and more efficient supervision in EU capital markets’, from 8 May to 5 June 2025 ;  · European Commission targeted consultation on ‘Integration of EU capital markets’ from 15 April to 10 June 2025.  The call for evidence generated 53 responses from a broad range of stakeholders. Business associations formed the largest group, accounting for 62.3% of responses, and representing the investment, banking and asset management industries. Companies and businesses, primarily from the financial sector, accounted for 20.8%. Individual members of the public accounted for 9.4% of responses, while other categories, including chambers of commerce, professional associations and advisory firms, accounted for 5.7%, and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) accounted for 1.9%.  The purpose of the call for evidence was to (i) gather stakeholders’ views on barriers that prevent the EU’s trading and post-trading infrastructures from reaping the benefits of a truly frictionless single market; (ii) examine whether the current regulatory and supervisory setting is fit for the capital markets and in particular for market operators with strong cross-border activities or operating in new or emerging sectors; and (iii) review the European Supervisory Authorities’ toolbox to assess areas where its effectiveness and efficiency can be strengthened and improved.  Across all stakeholder groups, there was broad agreement on the need for more integrated capital markets and enhanced supervisory convergence. This was accompanied by a shared call for simplification, proportionality and legal certainty. Stakeholders widely recognised that a more integrated and efficient financial ecosystem would enhance Europe’s competitiveness, improve access to finance, and expand investment opportunities. Nonetheless, they stressed that reforms must remain balanced, transparent and inclusive, demonstrating tangible benefits for citizens and the real economy. The level of support for centralising supervision at EU level varied significantly among stakeholders. Business associations and companies tended to prefer incremental progress within the current institutional structure, while NGOs and some members of the public favoured stronger EU-level oversight to ensure consistency and accountability.  In addition to the call for evidence, the targeted consultation on ‘Integration of EU capital markets’ gathered views from a broad group of stakeholders on various aspects of the EU capital markets. The online questionnaire was structured in two parts. Part 1 covered simplification and burden reduction of the EU regulatory framework in the trading, post-trading and asset management sectors, barriers to cross-border operations in the trading space and to liquidity deepening in EU capital markets, and barriers to cross-border provisions of post-trade services. Part 2 included questions on: cross-sectoral barriers in the trading and post-trading sectors (e.g. relating to innovation, group synergies, issuance of financial instruments); barriers to cross-border provision of asset management services and investment funds; and barriers specifically linked to supervision.  In total, 297 stakeholders replied to the targeted consultation through the Commission website. The majority of contributions came from business associations (31%) and companies or business entities (27%), followed by public authorities (12%). Additional input was received from NGOs (4%), EU citizens (3%), trade unions (2%), and one consumer organisation. The consultation thus attracted a diverse range of respondents from the industry, including market participants, representative associations and public authorities.  In parallel, bilateral meetings were held with selected stakeholders to gather additional input and explore specific concerns in greater depth. The Commission also introduced various aspects of the review at a meeting with representatives of the European Parliament and Member State financial services attachés in October and November 2025.  The results of the call for evidence and targeted consultation have been considered in the proposal and the Commission has sought to take account of the different stakeholder interests expressed. The most significant areas where respondents identified scope for improvements were examined and have been included in the proposal. These include calls for a more proportionate, simpler and more harmonised regulatory framework that reduces burdens and eliminates barriers in the areas of trading, post-trading and cross-border distribution of investment funds, as well as increasing the efficiency and convergence of supervision of financial entities.  • Collection and use of expertise  When preparing this initiative, the Commission consulted several studies and sources of information. The Commission organised in September 2024 a round-table discussion on consolidation in the investment funds sector and trading and post-trading infrastructure with private and public stakeholders, and experts in those sectors. The Commission has also organised separate bilateral outreach to key stakeholders and workshops with the industry. The studies used to prepare this proposal have been referenced in the impact assessment accompanying this proposal and documenting the barriers that this package is trying to address.  • Impact assessment  In line with the Better Regulation policy, the Commission conducted an impact assessment of policy alternatives. Beyond the option of no EU action (Baseline scenario – Option 1), two packages of policy options were identified based on a call for evidence, a targeted consultation, other stakeholder engagements, a study on consolidation and reducing fragmentation in trading and post-trading infrastructures in Europe, a study of barriers to, and drivers of, the scaling-up of funds investing in innovative and growth companies, literature reviews, and previous initiatives and reports documenting the most significant barriers to the integration of EU capital markets that have been existing for several years and have not yet been fully addressed.  Option 1 is the baseline option of doing nothing. Option 2 involves a broad review of the trading, post-trading and asset management rulebooks to harmonise and streamline requirements for business operations, including easing some requirements within groups and for services provided on a cross-border basis, under a single license. In the settlement area, interconnectedness between central securities depositories (CSDs) would also be improved.  Option 2 would also include amendments to post-trade legislation to make it more technologically neutral as well as to the DLT pilot regime (DLTPR) to expand its scope and scale. Investment funds would gain immediate and full single market access upon authorisation, and asset management groups would be able to operate more efficiently across borders. On supervision, Option 2 aims to strengthen the use and effectiveness of supervisory convergence tools and powers, focusing on the European Securities and Markets Authorities (ESMA) and its governance. This option also involves transferring supervisory powers to ESMA for the most significant infrastructures (central counterparties, CSDs and trading venues) and for all the crypto-asset service providers (CASPs), and to have ESMA coordinating the supervision of large asset managers and investment funds.  Option 3 builds on Option 2 but is more far-reaching with additional elements to establish an integrated market, such as, for instance, mandatory connection between significant trading venues, mandating links between CSDs, creating group-level authorisation for asset managers, full flexibility in the DLTPR, ESMA direct supervision of all infrastructures, asset managers and CASPs.  The analysis assesses the options in relation to three objectives: (i) enabling further market integration and scale effects; (ii) enabling integrated supervision; and (iii) facilitating innovation. It shows that the additional elements in Option 3 would imply higher costs for the sectors and for supervisors, outweighing the potential benefits. In addition, this option is less coherent with other EU policy initiatives and may have unintended consequences on competition and on financial stability risks.  The assessment concludes that Option 2 is the preferred policy package as it delivers significant integration benefits while remaining proportionate in terms of costs and subsidiarity. It combines extensive harmonisation of requirements in the relevant trading, post-trading and asset management frameworks and removal of barriers to cross-border activities, with stronger supervisory convergence tools and powers and EU-level supervision of the most significant infrastructures. These aspects reinforce one another. The harmonisation of rules in this package would facilitate the transfer of supervision of some operators and markets to the EU level and, in the case of CASPs, for all entities, and allow better enforcement of the single rulebook.  By removing undue regulatory barriers to integration, the measures under this option would ease regulatory burdens and operational complexity, thereby improving the efficiency of providing services across borders and fostering market integration. Implementation costs would fall mainly on infrastructures and national authorities. This option would also require significant resources and infrastructure development at ESMA, the majority of it would be fee funded. But all these costs are expected to be outweighed by efficiency gains and simplification in the medium term. The initiative would reduce legal uncertainty for issuers and investors, lower compliance costs and improve predictability. Increased flexibility in the DLT-pilot regime and changes in sectoral legislation to make it more compatible with DLT would encourage greater uptake of this technology. Stronger supervisory convergence and a more integrated supervisory framework would level the playing field, limit regulatory arbitrage and reduce the administrative burden related to cross-border activities.  The initiative will facilitate investors’ access to a wide range of investment opportunities and enable companies to raise capital across borders, including SMEs. It will therefore contribute to improve how we mobilise capital in Europe and allow the right financing ecosystem to emerge in order to support EU strategic priorities and make our economy stronger, more competitive.  The Regulatory Scrutiny Board issued a positive assessment of the impact assessment following a first negative opinion. To address the comments raised by the Board, the impact assessment has been revised in order to: (i) clarify the rationale for the initiative’s scope and its role within the broader SIU strategy, including its interplay with other initiatives; (ii) streamline the sections on the problem definition and problem drivers; (iii) improve the explanations related to DLT-based innovation; (iv) clarify the intervention logic and the objectives. The text has also been revised to strengthen the analysis of the magnitude of the problems, based on additional quantitative inputs received from stakeholders and on other existing studies, to better assess costs/benefits. The text is also more transparent about the limitation in data availabilities and out-of-scope factors that make a full robust modelling of the costs and benefits not possible. Stakeholder views have also been reflected more comprehensively through the text, and the impact of the proposed measures on different stakeholder groups better captured.  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  The measures proposed will ease regulatory burdens and operational complexity, thereby improving the efficiency of providing services across borders and fostering market- integration. Implementation costs will fall mainly on infrastructures and national authorities. ESMA will also need significant resources and infrastructure development. But all these costs are expected to be outweighed by efficiency gains and simplification in the medium term. The initiative will reduce legal uncertainty for issuers and investors, lower compliance costs and improve predictability. Increased flexibility in the DLT Pilot Regime and changes in sectoral legislation to make it more compatible with DLT will encourage greater uptake of this technology. Stronger supervisory convergence and a more integrated supervisory framework will level the playing field and reduce the administrative burden related to cross-border activities. Simplification will be achieved in several ways: transitioning certain provisions from directives to regulations; eliminating scope for nationally imposed ‘gold-plating’ measures;  streamlining overlapping, costly and inefficient supervisory arrangements; and more generally removing barriers in the EU and national frameworks for market operators and investors. With a view to simplifying the regulatory framework and reducing regulatory and administrative burdens, this proposal refines Level 2 empowerments by deleting and updating empowerments including those, which following the consultations with the European Parliament, the Council and European Supervisory Authorities were considered non-essential for the effective functioning of the corresponding provisions in the basic acts. Furthermore, the Commission has, in this proposal, sought to limit as much as possible the number of new Level 2 empowerments.  • Fundamental rights  The proposal respects fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, in particular the right to provide services in any Member State (Article 15(2), the freedom to conduct a business (Article 16), the right to property (Article 17), access to services of general economic interest to promote social and territorial cohesion within the Union (Article 36), and consumer protection (Article 38).  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  The financial and budgetary impact of this package is explained in detail in the legislative financial statement annexed to the Master Regulation. It also includes the financial and budgetary impacts of the Master Directive.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  The Commission will monitor progress towards achieving the specific objectives based on the non-exhaustive list of indicators listed in Section 9 of the accompanying impact assessment. The list focuses on the indicators per sector, but broader indicators to measure the wider impact on the market will also be monitored, even if those can be less directly attributed to this initiative. Such indicators include measures assessing access to capital and corporate financing structures or the level of retail investor participation in capital market.  Ex-post evaluation of all new legislative measures is a priority for the Commission. The Commission services will review the outputs, results and impacts of this initiative once the legal instrument has entered into force. After five years, the Commission will carry out the next evaluation of the amendments contained in this proposal, in line with the Commission’s Better Regulation Guidelines.  • Explanatory documents (for directives)  No explanatory documents are considered necessary.  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  This Master Regulation consists of amendments to:  · Regulation (EU) No 1095 /2010 (ESMA Regulation ; Article 1) ;  · Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 ( EMIR; Article 2) ;  · Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 (MiFIR ; Article 3) ;  · Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 (CSDR ; Article 4) ;  · Re gulation (EU) 2015/2365 ( SFTR; Article 5) ;  · Regulation (EU) 2019/1156 ( CBDR ; Article 6 ) ;  · Regulation (EU) 2021/23 ( CCPRRR; Article 7) ;  · Regulation (EU) 2022/858 ( DLTPR ; Article 8 ) ;  · Regulation ( EU) 2023/1114 ( MiCA ; Article 9 ) ;  · Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 (CRA Regulation; Article 10);  · Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 ( Benchmarks Regulation; Article 11);  · Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 (Securitisation Regulation; Article 12);  · Regulation (EU) 2023/2631 (European Green Bonds Regulation; Article 13); and  · Regulation (EU) 2024/3005 (ESG Ratings Regulation; Article 14) .  Article 1 – Amendments to ESMA Regulation  The proposed amendments to Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 (the ESMA Regulation) aim to strengthen ESMA’s mandate, governance and funding to ensure more consistent, transparent and accountable supervision across the EU. This will create better conditions for market integration, generate efficiency gains and increase investors’ trust in the single market.  In terms of tasks and powers the proposed amendments adopt a twofold approach: (i) a proposal to transfer supervisory powers to ESMA for significant market infrastructure entities and CASPs; and (ii) amendments to increase the use and effectiveness of supervisory convergence tools. These changes are underpinned by a review of ESMA’s governance and funding arrangements to ensure that decision-making at EU level is simple, independent and efficient and that appropriate resources are available to implement the new objectives.  General tasks and powers  The amendments to Articles 1, 4 and 8 aim to clarify the scope of the Regulation and provide updated definitions to reflect the new direct supervisory responsibilities. The changes also bring ESMA’s mandate into line with the objectives of promoting innovation, data driven supervision and effective enforcement.  The new Article 8a on the duty of cooperation emphasises the importance of cooperation between ESMA and authorities. The aim is to promote greater collaboration, information-sharing, and mutual support and create a framework for structured yet flexible cooperation between ESMA and other competent or relevant authorities. In particular, this would ensure that ESMA can carry out its direct supervisory tasks smoothly, effectively, and proportionately, while safeguarding its independence. It is proposed that ESMA will establish flexible practical arrangements for cooperation , tailored to specific sectors and tasks, and guided by the principles of efficiency, proportionality and mutual trust. These arrangements may include joint supervisory teams, joint inspections, or operational coordination. They should allow for gradual adjustments over time. Arrangements for cooperation should prioritise effective and resource-efficient supervision, continuity and consistency of supervisory outcomes, and respect for the statutory responsibilities and resources of other authorities. The new Article 8a will enable ESMA and other authorities to work more effectively together, leveraging their collective expertise and resources to address the complex challenges facing the EU's financial system. This, in turn, will contribute to a more integrated, stable, and prosperous European financial market.  To ensure effective supervision, the amendments to Article 9a broaden the scope of ESMA’s power to issue ""no action letters"" to cater for specific circumstances where the application of a legislative act raises significant issues for market participants. The aim is to provide clarity and guidance to market participants and reduce the risk of inconsistent application of EU law.  The amendments to Articles 10 and 15 give the Commission the power to adopt an amending delegated or implementing act even if ESMA does not provide a draft. This addresses a current gap in the procedural framework for the adoption of technical standards. The proposed amendments also establish a procedure for temporarily suspending regulatory or implementing standards (or parts of them) under specific conditions. These procedures aim to make ESMA’s regulatory powers more flexible and adaptable and should allow the Commission to improve rulemaking and increase responsiveness to new market developments, thereby ensuring the smooth functioning of the financial markets.  The a mendments to Articles 8(2), 17 and 19(4) clarify that, in accordance with the Corneli judgment 13 , ESMA must apply Union law . This includes national laws that implement EU Directives, which sh ould be interpreted in a way that is consistent with those Directives.  Article 17aa gives ESMA a new power in the area of supervisory convergence to require a competent authority to seek its opinion in cases where a peer review or investigation has identified serious supervisory failures. Furthermore, ESMA will have the power to require prompt and effective corrective actions to be taken to address supervisory shortcomings. The aim of this new safeguard measure is to allow ESMA to act in cases where products or entities would be granted access to the EU market without adequate supervision or where supervisory arbitrage would undermine the passport system.  Article 19a introduces collaboration platforms between competent authorities, that will enhance cooperation and supervision of cross-border activities. This builds on the successful experience with similar platforms under the Solvency II Directive. These platforms will facilitate information exchange, propose solutions and promote a culture of collaboration. ESMA will have the power to resolve any disputes.  Articles 28a and 28b provide for a mechanism to be set up for the mutual recognition of administrative fines and assistance with their recovery in a cross-border context. The aim is to make it easier to enforce the rules in the single market, in contrast to the current situation, in which recovering fines in another jurisdiction is very complex or even impossible.  Supervisory powers  To ensure effective and consistent supervision across sectors, it is proposed to insert a new Chapter IIa which consolidates ESMA's procedural powers as currently set out in sectoral legislation into a single, cross-sectoral framework. This framework streamlines the rules for information requests, investigations, on-site inspections, supervisory measures, and penalties, while safeguarding rights of defence, legal professional privilege, and judicial protection. By establishing a consistent and uniform set of procedural powers, the Regulation increases legal certainty, promotes supervisory convergence and efficiency, and helps ESMA's to exercise its direct supervisory responsibilities accountably. These powers are without prejudice to any more specific or different powers set out in other EU Acts.  Funding  To ensure the ESMA’s supervisory activities are financed in a fair and transparent manner, the Regulation proposes to harmonise the principles governing the fees charged to financial market participants under ESMA’s supervision ( Article 39n ). The Regulation consolidates the principles currently scattered across sectoral legislation in order to establish a unified framework for fee calculation, scope and transparency. The proposed amendments promote legal certainty and transparency for both existing and new entities, thereby enabling them to better anticipate and plan for supervisory fees. The proposed amendments ultimately help ESMA to effectively supervise and regulate the financial sector.  An amendment has also been made to Regulation (EU) 2015/2365 to bring it into line with the changes to the fees charged to financial market participants by ESMA.  Governance  This proposal provides for a more effective governance structure for ESMA. It replaces the current Management Board with an Executive Board with independent full-time members (Articles 44a and 46a) and adjusts the composition of the Board of Supervisors (Article 40). The proposal clarifies the respective responsibilities of these two boards (Articles 43 and 46a). The Executive Board will consist of the chairperson and 5 full-time members, with diverse supervisory experiences, and, collectively, an appropriate understanding of the sectors under ESMA’s supervision. The members will be appointed in a process involving the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council. They will be subject to strict conflict of interest rules and their mandate will be limited to 5 years with the possibility of an extension of two years. Article 46a sets out the tasks of the Executive Board, which will mainly be responsible for decisions relating to the direct supervision of financial market participants. The Executive Board will also have a range of decision-making powers, including over individual competent authorities on certain non-regulatory matters, such as dispute settlement, matters relating to a breach of EU law and independent reviews. This will contribute to more effective decision-making that ensures a good balance between national specificities and common EU interests. The Executive Board will take over the responsibilities of the Management Board for preparing ESMA’s work programmes and budget, and the activities of the Management Board will cease. All existing references to the Management Board will be replaced by references to the Executive Board. The members of the Executive Board, including the chairperson, will have one vote each and the chairperson will have a casting vote.  The Board of Supervisors remains ESMA’s main body in charge of overall guidance and decision-making on regulatory matters and supervisory convergence. The proposed amendments to Article 40 change the composition of the Board of Supervisors to include the full-time members of the Executive Board. The Board of Supervisors will be able to object to the main supervisory decisions taken by the Executive Board within 10 days, or 48 hours in urgent cases. The Executive Board can request opinions from the Board of Supervisors on supervisory matters and must report to the Board of Supervisors on its supervisory activities twice a year. In their capacity as voting members of the Board of Supervisors, the members of the Executive Board will bring their expertise to the Board of Supervisors and vote on general supervisory convergence matters.  Article 2 – Amendments to the European Market Infrastructure Regulation  Supervision of significant CCPs  New Articles 22a to 22c are introduced to give ESMA direct supervision over significant CCPs, to specify all the details regarding the processes for a CCP to be determined as a significant CCP by ESMA, to specify the powers attributed to ESMA over significant CCPs and to introduce a provision regarding the supervisory fees charged by ESMA to CCPs it supervises. Article 12 is amended to give ESMA the power to impose penalties. A new Annex V is also introduced to provide a list of infringements for which ESMA can impose fines. Article 2 is amended to adapt the definition of ‘competent authority’ and to introduce new definitions of the terms ‘significant CCP’, ‘CCP’s competent authority’ and ‘national competent authority’. In addition, Article 22 is amended to provide Member States with the option to appoint ESMA as the CCP’s competent authority also for their less significant CCPs. To ensure that these definitions are consistent across related pieces of Regulation and to reflect ESMA’s supervisory authority over significant CCPs, amendments have also been introduced to Regulation (EU) 2021/23.  Articles 14, 17 18, 20 are adapted to abolish colleges for significant CCPs and to adjust the various procedures to account for ESMA’s new role, for example by removing the need for ESMA opinions when significant CCPs are involved and to cater for the abolition of the CCP Supervisory Committee.  In addition, Article 23 is amended to add provisions about ESMA’s collaboration with the ‘relevant authorities for significant CCPs’. This change is accompanied by the introduction of a new definition of the term ‘relevant authorities for significant CCPs’ in Article 2, and a new Article 22d to provide a detailed list of relevant authorities for such CCPs. In addition, Articles, 17c, 20, 23, and 24 are amended to take into account this new term in the related procedures and information flows.  Article 89 is amended to align the transitional provisions for CCPs which were already authorised before the entry into force of this amending Regulation.  Supervision of less significant CCPs  Article 2 is amended to introduce a definition of ‘less significant CCP’. Article 18 is amended to make ESMA the sole chair of colleges for less significant CCPs. In addition, Articles 24a, 24d and 25c are amended and Articles 24e and 90 are deleted to reflect changes to ESMA’s internal governance, notably the introduction of ESMA’s new Executive Board and the removal of the CCP Supervisory Committee.  Open access and interoperability processes  Articles 7, 8 and 54 are amended to give ESMA the right to arbitrate requests for access to a CCP and requests for access to a trading venue and to approve requests for interoperability arrangements.  Article 3 – Amendments to the Markets in Financial Infrastructure Regulation  Trading venues are currently supervised on a national basis. A key pillar of this proposal is to transfer supervisory competences for significant trading venues and Pan-European Market Operators or PEMOs (and trading venues operated by PEMOs) to ESMA. A trading venue will be deemed significant if it is important for the EU economy or if, in addition to being significant in size, it has a significant cross-border dimension. The proposal gives ESMA the necessary powers to carry out its supervisory tasks, although certain market surveillance powers remain at national level and are conferred on the national surveillance authorities.  Given the importance of proximity to the local market ecosystems, national surveillance authorities would retain responsibilities at local level to ensure the market integrity of the significant trading venues or trading venues operated by a PEMO. However, those responsibilities would be limited to supervising orderly trading and monitoring market abuse and would not extend to obligations directly imposed on trading venues.  Harmonisation of the rules applicable to trading venues  Directive 2014/65/EU (the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II) sets out the rules for the authorisation and operation of trading venues. However, the fact that those rules were set out in a Directive has led to EU law being transposed and interpreted differently. It has also resulted in many Member States adopting additional measures in areas not strictly harmonised under the Directive, such as prudential requirements for regulated markets. Creating a truly ‘single rule book’ for trading venues is a precondition for effective supervision at EU level. The proposal therefore inserts a new Title Ia in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 (the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation) to further harmonise the rules for trading venues and remove national rules that hinder the functioning of the single market. A significant number of the measures have been directly transferred from the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II, but the new Title Ia also further specifies the applicable framework in areas that were previously left to national discretion.  In addition, the proposed new Title Ia clarifies the types of cross-border activities that a regulated market may carry out on the basis of its individual licence. It therefore also clarifies that not only should regulated markets be able to provide arrangements to enable access to their venue from other Member States (through ‘trading screens’), as already provided for in the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II, but they should also be able to provide services linked to: (i) the admission to trading of securities on their venue; and (ii) the admission of new members from other Member States. It also clarifies that regulated markets can do this either by setting up a branch or, without a branch, through the freedom to provide services across the EU single market. Multilateral trading facilities and organised trading facilities have the same rights.  Lastly, the proposal aims to make it easier to allocate resources and functions within a group. Title Ia therefore clarifies that allocating resources to an entity within the same group or relying on such an entity to perform certain functions should not be considered outsourcing for the purpose of the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation. It also clarifies that the geographical location of an entity to which resources are allocated or which is relied upon to perform certain functions should not be relevant to the competent authority’s assessment of the compliance of the trading venue with its organisational requirements.  Creation of a ‘Pan-European Market Operator’ status  The proposal creates a new ‘Pan-European Market Operator’ (PEMO) status, which allows for the operation of several trading venues in more than one Member State on the basis of a single licence. If a PEMO takes over existing trading venues, the proposal provides for the individual authorisation(s) under which those venues operated to be deemed void once the new PEMO authorisation is issued. The new Title Ia sets out the authorisation procedure in detail and the requirements applicable to PEMOs. The proposal also clarifies that a PEMO should be responsible for ensuring that the trading venues it operates comply with the requirements applicable to regulated markets, multilateral trading facilities or organised trading facilities, as appropriate. Lastly, for areas of law that are not yet harmonised (e.g. tax law) or not yet fully harmonised (e.g. rules on transparency) under EU law, the proposal clarifies that, for each trading venue, the PEMO should apply the law of the Member State where that trading venue is deemed to be situated or operated, and that the relevant national surveillance authority should be that of the Member State where a venue operated by a PEMO is deemed to be situated or operated. In addition, it is clarified that, where a PEMO takes over the operation of a trading venue that has already been authorised, that trading venue should be deemed to be situated or operated in the Member State where it was initially authorised.  Open access  Under this proposal, the rules under which a trading venue has access to the services of a CCP (Article 35 of the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation) and under which a CCP has access to the trade feeds of a trading venue (Article 36 of the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation) would be streamlined to ensure that such access is not unjustifiably delayed and that access is refused only where there are significant systemic risks or risks to the orderly functioning of the markets. Furthermore, the market practice known as ‘preferred clearing’ would be prohibited where two parties choose to clear at different CCPs that have already been granted access to a given trading venue and have already put in place interoperability arrangements.  Enhancement of the consolidated tape  Under the current Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation, the consolidated tape for shares and exchange-traded funds does not provide information on the identity of the trading venue offering the best bid and offer price or on the depth of the trading book. Given the importance of this information to users of the consolidated tape, the proposal adds it to the tape. The proposal also enhances transparency on quotes by systematic internalisers for orders originating from retail clients.  Article 4 – Amendments to the Central Securities Depository Regulation  Modernisation of the regulatory framework for CSD services  Article 2 of the Central Securities Depositories Regulation is amended in order to allow for the provision of CSD services using DLT. Specifically, the existing definitions of ‘book-entry’, ‘cash’ and ‘securities accounts’ are amended and definitions of ‘distributed ledger technology’ and ‘e-money token’ are added. Similarly, Article 30 related to outsourcing is amended to cover the provision of CSD services using DLT and a new article (Article 45a) is introduced on risks related to the use of DLT outside of an outsourcing arrangement. Finally, the framework set out in Title IV for the settlement of the cash leg of a securities transaction is amended to allow settlement, under specific conditions, with certain e-money tokens authorised under the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation.  Supervision of significant CSDs  Article 11 of the CSDR is amended to give ESMA direct supervisory authority over significant CSDs and a new Article 11a is added to set out the conditions and procedures for determining which EU CSDs are ‘significant’. As ESMA will become the direct supervisor of significant CSDs, Article 2 is amended to adjust the definition of ‘competent authority’, and a new definition of ‘national competent authority’ is added. Article 10 is amended to reflect ESMA’s new role as supervisor. Title V on sanctions is also amended to reflect ESMA’s new role, and a new Annex II lists the of infringements for which ESMA can impose sanctions.  Article 24a is amended to abolish colleges for significant CSDs and Articles 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 21a, 22b, 27b, 60 and 62 are amended to adjust the various procedures to account for ESMA’s new role. This includes, for example, removing the need for an opinion from ESMA where significant CSDs are involved. Article 10 also provides further details of ESMA’s oversight and supervisory powers over significant CSDs.  Given ESMA’s new powers over significant CSDs, a new Article 25a sets out the framework for the supervisory fees that can be charged by ESMA.  Integration of CSD services  Article 14 is amended to provide more detailed provisions on the cooperation between ESMA, relevant authorities, and national competent authorities.  Article 2 is amended to introduce a definition of the term ‘CSD hub’, and a new Article 48a sets out the procedure for ESMA to determine which EU CSDs are considered CSD hubs. To facilitate access to all financial instruments issued in EU CSDs, Article 48a introduces a requirement for CSD hubs to establish reciprocal links with other CSD hubs, and for CSDs that are not hubs to establish reciprocal links with a CSD hub.  To further integrate EU CSDs, Article 40 is amended to require EU CSDs that settle the cash leg of their transactions in a currency available on an EU integrated platform to directly connect to that platform and enable their participants to settle the cash leg in accounts opened on that platform.  Article 54 is amended to relax the requirements that apply when a CSD wishes to designate a credit institution to provide banking-type ancillary services, specifically when the cash leg is settled in non-EU currencies.  Article 19a is added to introduce a simplified process for outsourcing core services within a group of CSDs.  Improving the CSD passporting regime  With the aim of lifting the remaining barriers to the passporting of CSD services in the EU, Article 23 is amended to require only an ex-post notification when an EU CSD starts offering its services to issuers established in another Member State than the Member State of authorisation of the CSD.  Article 6 – Amendments to the Cross-Border Distribution Regulation  The proposeed changes to Regulation (EU) 2019/1156 (the Cross-Border Distribution Regulation) are aimed at removing barriers to the cross-border operations of investment funds and strengthen ESMA’s powers to foster a common supervisory culture and better coordinate activities across home and host national competent authorities.  Harmonisation of marketing communications  Article 4 of the Cross-Border Distribution Regulation is amended to clarify that AIFMs, EuVECA and EuSEF managers and UCITS management companies should ensure that the requirements on marketing communications are met even when the marketing function is delegated to a third party. However, where the marketing is performed by third-party distributors acting on their own behalf so that the AIFMs and UCITS management companies are no longer in control of the marketing function, the AIFMs and UCITS management companies are not subject to the requirements on marketing communications. It is further specified that host Member States cannot impose any additional requirements on marketing communications than the ones laid down in Article 4. Moreover, the Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts to specify the format and content of marketing communications.  Articles 5, 6, 8, 11 and 13 of the Cross-Border Distribution Regulation are deleted to reduce diverging national practices on marketing communications and the payment of regulatory fees and charges.  Article 7 of the Cross-Border Distribution Regulation is replaced by a new Article 7 specifying that the competent authorities of host Member States shall not require prior notification of marketing communications, but where they believe that marketing communications do not comply with the requirements of Article 4 , they may ask the competent authorities of the home Member State of the AIFM, EuVECA or EuSEF manager or UCITS to take all appropriate measures to prevent or penalise further irregularities. The competent authorities of host Member States may further refer the matter to ESMA if they are not satisfied with the actions taken by the home competent authorities.  Increase transparency on fees and charges levied by host Member States  Article 9 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1156 is amended to mandate ESMA to publish and maintain up-to-date information on the regulatory fees and changes imposed by host competent authorities to AIFMs, EuVECA managers, EuSEF managers and UCITS marketing AIFs or UCITS in their territories, including the level and frequency of those fees and the modalities of their payment.  Improve the passporting regime for UCITS and AIFs  Article 12 of the Cross-Border Distribution Regulation is deleted and is replaced by a new power for ESMA to develop a data platform that would include information on AIFs and UCITS marketed on a cross-border basis, the documentation provided as part of their marketing notification and any changes thereof, and the de-notifications of marketing arrangements.  The former Chapter XI of Directive 2009/65/EC and Articles 30a, 31, 32 and 32a of Directive 2011/61/EU governing the marketing of UCITS and EU AIFs managed by EU AIFMs across the Union are imported into Regulation (EU) 2019/1156 and amended to optimise marketing notification and de-notification procedures and facilitate the cross-border marketing of AIFs and UCITS. In particular, Regulation (EU) 2019/1156 is complemented to allow UCITS and AIFMs to market funds in a Member State other than their home Member State, by indicating such intention in their application for authorisation and transmitting as part of their authorisation documentation linked to the marketing of UCITS or AIFs in other Member States (eg. marketing communications, the key investor information document, the prospectus, the annual report). Upon authorisation, the competent authorities of the home Member State of the UCITS or AIFM shall transmit that information to the ESMA data platform and the UCITS or AIFM can access the markets of the Member States indicated in their application for authorisation as of the date of that transmission. Regulation (EU) 2019/1156 is further complemented to introduce specific procedures when there are changes to the scope of the initial marketing notification, including changes to the Member States in which the units or shares of UCITS or AIFs are to be marketed.  The former Articles 32a of Directive 2011/61/EU and 93a of Directive 2009/65/EC are imported to Regulation (EU) 2019/1156 and are amended to simplify the de-notification of arrangements made for the marketing of units or shares of UCITS or AIFs. The existing 36-month prohibition of pre-marketing of units or shares of EU AIFs with similar investment strategies in the Member State identified in the de-notification is removed.  Supervision of UCITS and AIFs marketed across the EU  The Cross-Border Distribution Regulation is complemented to specify the powers of the host competent authorities of the AIFM and UCITS vis-a-vis the AIFs and UCITS marketed in their territories. Regulation (EU) 2019/1156 is further supplemented to empower ESMA to identify and pursue actions to address diverging, duplicative, redundant and deficient supervisory actions hindering the cross-border marketing of EU AIFs managed by an EU AIFM and of UCITS across the Union. In addition, the Cross-Border Distribution Regulation is amended to grant ESMA the power to intervene when national authorities do not effectively apply Union rules, or to directly suspend the cross-border marketing of AIFs and UCITS in certain cases.  Finally, the Cross-Border Distribution Regulation is supplemented to clarify that competent authorities should be able to refer to ESMA any disagreements on assessments, actions, or omissions, which ESMA should settle in accordance with the powers conferred to it under Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.  Article 8 – Amendments to EU DLT Pilot Regime Regulation  This proposal also amends the DLT Pilot regime (Regulation (EU) 2022/858) to increase the regime’s flexibility and proportionality, as well as its scale and scope and to address concerns around the durability of the regime by removing the time limits of the permissions granted under the pilot.  Expanding and making more flexible the scope of eligible instruments and scale of activities  Article 2 is amended to introduce new concepts. Among others, the trading infrastructure in the Pilot is now referred to as a DLT trading venue (DLT TV) to reflect that it would be possible to operate both a multilateral trading system and an organised trading facility under the Pilot. Article 3 is amended to make more flexible current limits of the pilot regime, both on the type of financial instruments that are eligible as well as on the scale of activity that can be carried out in these instruments. For the scale of activities, the proposal would maintain a total maximal aggregated market value of all the DLT financial instruments that can be admitted to trading or recorded on a DLT market infrastructure but raise it to EUR 100 billion. Finally, product-specific threshold would be removed.  Creating a simplified regime for smaller DLT market infrastructures  Article 3 is further amended and a new Article 7a is added to introduce a simplified regime for operators of smaller DLT infrastructures providing CSD services as long as they remain under threshold of no more than EUR 10 billion of total market value of recorded DLT financial instruments. The simplified regime would feature rules that are adapted to the scale of activities undertaken by smaller operators. Depending on the activities they plan to undertake, applicants to the simplified regime would be required to hold an underlying authorisation to be eligible, such as a CASP, a CSD or an investment firm licence. The entities operating under the simplified regime would be subject to a specified subset of provisions of Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 that result in a more proportionate and principles-based approach to the regulation of small-scale provision of CSD services.  Expanding scope of eligible entities  Article 4 is amended to expand the scope of entities which can operate a DLT TV and a DLT trading and settlement system (DLT TSS) to include, in addition to investment firms and CSDs, also crypto-assets services providers (CASPs) that are authorised to operate a crypto-asset trading platform. CASPs permitted to operate a DLT market infrastructure, would become subject to requirements set out in EU trading and post-trading rules (Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, Directive 2014/65/EU and Regulation (EU) No 909/2014) while benefiting from targeted and justifiable exemptions like other operators of DLT market infrastructures.  Additional exemptions regarding applicants operating a DLT TV and a DLT settlement systems (DLT SS)  New Articles 4a and 5a are introduced to offer operators of DLT market infrastructures the possibility to obtain, under certain strict conditions, exemptions from a wide range of provisions of Directive 2014/65/EU, Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 and Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 where these have been found to be incompatible or highly disproportionate with the use of DLT. Before granting exemptions from specific provisions, competent authorities must seek a non-binding opinion from ESMA.  Specific rules for operators of a DLT SS settling payments using commercial bank money and e-money tokens  Article 5 is amended to enable operators of a DLT SS to designate credit institutions for the settlement of payments in commercial bank money that satisfy the prudential and capital requirements of Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 but that will be able to engage in other activities beyond providing banking-type ancillary services of the purpose of settlement. As regards settlement of payments in e-money tokens, it is clarified that most banking ancillary services involving e-money tokens should be provided by the same type of credit institutions as those that can settle payments in commercial bank money.  Provision of individual CSD services, settlement schemes and interoperability between DLT market infrastructures  New Articles 10a to 10f are introduced to, firstly, allow for service-specific regulation of two CSD core services, the notary and central maintenance service, and, secondly, to introduce a new model for settlement that relies on of DLT account keepers with access to central bank money. These articles also ensure comprehensive supervision of these new ways to provide CSD core services. Both the DLT notary and the DLT central maintenance services can be provided by an investment firm, a regulated market, a credit institution, a CSD, or a CASP that obtain a specific permission to provide that service, upon demonstrating compliance with applicable provisions of Regulation (EU) No 909/2014. Consequently, it will be possible to issue and record DLT financial instruments outside a CSD, however, these instruments will be required to be settled with a regulated market infrastructure. Furthermore, the settlement of DLT financial instruments will be possible between DLT account keepers having access to central bank money accounts. These DLT account keepers will have to be a part of a settlement scheme, which is a set of rules and procedures agreed between participants for settling DLT financial instruments, and which has to be previously assessed and authorised by ESMA. The settlement scheme and participating DLT account keepers will have to comply with a number of requirements ensuring robust settlement outcomes and report regularly to ESMA.  Finally, new Article 10g requires entities active in the post-trading value chain in the Pilot, and beyond, to establish technical standards that support interoperability between DLT market infrastructures, with an obligation to report on their work on ESMA. Taking into account the efforts of the industry, ESMA is required to provide the Commission with technical advice on supporting interoperability between DLT market infrastructures.  Article 9 – Amendments to the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation  Transfer of supervision of crypto-asset service providers  The amendments to the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (EU) 2023/1114 (MiCA) seek to transfer the authorization, monitoring and supervision of all crypto-asset service providers (“CASPs”) from national competent authorities to ESMA. In this respect, the definitions in Article 3 and the provisions of Titles V and VI (Articles 59-92) of the MiCA Regulation are amended to render ESMA responsible for the authorisation, monitoring and supervision of crypto-asset service providers, including the provisions that relate to market abuse for the crypto-asset sector.  Treatment of certain financial entities providing crypto-asset services  Certain firms subject to Union legislative acts on financial services are already allowed to provide all or some crypto-asset services without being required to obtain an authorization as a crypto-asset service provider under MiCA. These entities will continue to be supervised for their crypto-asset activities by the competent authorities that granted them authorization under other Union acts. However, whe re the provision of crypto-asset services becomes the main activity of those entities, they will be treated as crypto-asset service providers and the supervision for all their activities will be transferred to ESMA. To fulfil this duty, it is provided that ESMA should establish cooperation agreements with the competent authorities that authorised those entities under other Union legislative acts on financial services. On the basis of the cooperation agreement, those competent authorities shall provide support and assistance to ESMA in the supervision of the activities that are not covered by Regulation (EU) 2023/1114. As there is already a centralized system of banking supervision, ensuring integration and consistency in supervision, there should be no transfer of supervisory powers where the entity providing crypto-asset services is a credit institution.  Supervisory powers of ESMA  In order to fulfil its supervisory duties under MiCA, including investigation of infringements of the rules on market abuse, the amendment introduces a new section on supervisory powers and competences of ESMA in Title VII (Articles 138a – 138j). This is accompanied by a new Annex VII, listing the possible infringements of provisions in Titles V and VI for crypto-asset service providers and other persons. ESMA will rely on the new supervisory powers introduced in Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 and the sector specific powers introduced in the new Chapter 6 of Title VII. Such powers include the power to carry out on-site inspections, take supervisory measures and impose fines. ESMA is empowered to take a range of supervisory measures, including, but not limited to, requiring the crypto-asset service provider to bring the infringement to an end, suspend the provision of crypto-asset services, and withdrawing the authorisation under certain conditions.  Cooperation with other authorities and assistance in carrying out tasks  ESMA is empowered to exchange information with competent authorities in Member States and third countries in order to carry out its supervisory responsibilities effectively, as well as cooperate with other relevant authorities and the European Banking Authority (Articles 138c -138f).  Transitional provisions  To avoid disruption to existing crypto-asset service providers, the amendment introduces transitional provisions (Article 143a) to ensure the smooth transition of supervision from national competent authorities to ESMA and a smooth transmission of files and working documents from national competent authorities to ESMA. A transitional period is also provided for applicants whose application for a CASP authorisation is currently being assessed by national competent authorities but has not been concluded.  Article 5 and Articles 10 to 14 - Amendments to Securities Financing Transactions Regulation, C redit rating agencies Regulation, Benchmarks Regulation, Securitisation Regulation , European Green Bonds Regulation and ESG Ratings Regulation  The amendments introduced in Articles 5 and 10 to 14 streamline the supervisory and enforcement framework applicable to trade repositories, credit rating agencies, benchmark administrators, securitisation repositories, external reviewers for European Green Bonds and ESG ratings providers by aligning their procedural regimes with the new horizontal supervisory framework established under the ESMA Regulation. A large number of sector-specific procedural provisions—particularly those governing investigatory powers, fines, periodic penalty payments, and related decision-making processes—are deleted and replaced with references to the consolidated toolbox in Articles 39a to 39m of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010. This shift removes duplicative and sometimes inconsistent procedural rules embedded in individual sectoral acts and replaces them with a single, coherent and predictable set of supervisory procedures. At the same time, the acts are updated to ensure that ESMA retains all powers necessary to supervise the relevant entities, including the power to suspend the use of credit ratings, impose fines, or exercise oversight over external reviewers, while fee-setting provisions are harmonised through a cross-cutting regime based on turnover. Collectively, these amendments reduce fragmentation, improve legal clarity and operational efficiency, and ensure that cross-sector supervision is exercised under a unified procedural framework, while preserving sector-specific rules where these remain essential.  2025/0383 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulations (EU) No 1095/2010, No 648/2012, No 600/2014, No 909/2014, 2015/2365, 2019/1156, 2021/23, 2022/858, 2023/1114, No 1060/2009, 2016/1011, 2017/2402, 2023/2631 and 2024/3005 as regards the further development of capital market integration and supervision within the Union  (Text with EEA relevance)  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 14 ,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Data Protection Supervisor,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) The S avings and Investments Union (SIU) strategy is part of the Commission strategy to provide a vision of the Union as an economic powerhouse . For that purpose, it is necessary to establish a single market for financial services by addressing market inefficiencies resulting from fragmentation and to create the truly integrated European capital markets which are accessible to all citizens and businesses across the Union . It is also important that financial markets potential of the Union is unlocked by providing access to more efficient capital-market based financing and by facilitating cross-border capital flows, which in turn should support the economy of the Union, stimulate job creation and enhance competitiveness.  (2) It is necessary to foster a seamless capital market across the EU by strengthening the supervisory framework and addressing regulatory fragmentation, thereby ensuring better integration of capital markets throughout the Union. In particular, w hile the integration of capital markets in the Union should ultimately be a market-driven process, certain barriers stemming notably from the Union legislative framework can obstruct progress. The Union should therefore focus on removing barriers in the sectors of trading, post-trading and asset management, and barriers hindering the uptake of new technologies . As market integration deepened, it is also crucial for the Union supervisory framework to evolve in accordance with it.  (3) In the context of the political objective of simplifying financial services legislation and delivering more effective and efficient implementation of Union policies, the Commission, after having consulted the European Supervisory Authorities, AMLA, the Council and the European Parliament, sent a letter on 1 October 2025 deprioritising empowerments non-essential for the effective functioning of the Level 1 legislations . For those deprioritised empowerments where the Commission would be legally required to act (‘shall + a date’) legal clarity for stakeholders would be enhanced when the basic act is also amended.  (4) The development of a deeper and more integrated Union capital market, as envisaged in the Savings and Investments Union Communication, requires consistent and effective supervision across Member States. Divergent national supervisory practices create legal uncertainty, increase the cost of cross-border activity and fragment the single market for financial services, thereby hindering market integration and the efficient allocation of capital. To address those challenges, it is necessary to strengthen supervisory convergence and, where appropriate, entrust the European Securities and Markets Authority (‘ESMA’) with additional tasks and powers to ensure the uniform application of Union law and the effective oversight of entities with significant cross-border relevance.  (5) For that purpose, ESMA should be given additional competences and its governance and funding framework should be reinforced to promote transparent, accountable and efficient decision-making at Union level and to ensure that ESMA has sufficient resources to fulfil its expanded responsibilities. The transfer of direct supervisory powers to ESMA in relation to significant entities in the field of market infrastructure and to crypto-asset service providers (CASPs), together with enhanced supervisory convergence tools, should contribute to a more integrated, competitive and resilient capital market that delivers better outcomes for investors, firms and the broader economy.  (6) Pursuant to Article 1(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 15 ) , ESMA is to act within the powers conferred on it by a range of Union legislative acts, including several Directives and Regulations listed therein. To ensure the full application of Union financial legislation, ESMA should apply national legislation transposing directives in a manner consistent with Union Law in a way that respects the primacy of Union Law,  (7) In addition , Article 1(2) of that Regulation further provides that ESMA is to act within the powers conferred by any other legally binding Union act which assigns tasks to ESMA . It is necessary to ensure that the scope of ESMA’s responsibilities and tasks automatically extends to any subsequent Union legislation conferring powers or functions on ESMA .  (8) To reflect the progressive extension of ESMA ’s direct supervisory, investigatory, enforcement and other responsibilities across different sectors of the financial system, it is necessary to introduce a definition of financial market participant s that are under ESMA’s supervision. That definition should encompass all financial market participants for which ESMA has been conferred powers. That definition should ensure consistency and clarity in the application of ESMA ’s supervisory powers, irrespective of the legal instrument from which those powers derive, and facilitate the establishment of common procedural and organisational arrangements for supervision and enforcement.  (9) To ensure the effective exercise of its direct supervisory responsibilities, ESMA should establish structured yet flexible cooperation arrangements with other authorities. Such cooperation should capture a range of situations, corresponding to the evolving role of ESMA. Such arrangements should cater, first, for cases where national competent authorities are still responsible for certain entities or activities but will cease to be in charge of supervision of certain entities following the assumption of direct supervisory powers by ESMA, thereby requiring transitional solutions to ensure continuity and an orderly transfer of responsibilities. Second, those cooperation arrangements should cover cases where, alongside ESMA ’s direct supervisory powers , other Union or national authorities, although not acting or having acted as competent authorities, hold relevant expertise or consultation rights under Union law, such as the European Central Bank in relation to central counterparties. Third, those cooperation arrangements should cover cases where tasks are not transferred to ESMA, such as market surveillance for trading venues. To address these different situations and, in particular, to ensure a smooth transition, the Authority should have the flexibility to set up cooperation arrangements adapted to the sector concerned, the nature of the tasks and the degree of involvement required. Such arrangements may range from close structural cooperation, including the establishment of joint supervisory teams or the conduct of joint inspections, to looser forms of operational coordination and, progressively, to more autonomous supervisory action by the Authority as its capacity develops. Those cooperation arrangements should also allow for their gradual adjustments over time and, where appropriate, the establishment of local presences of the Authority in Member States. Those cooperation arrangements should also promote effective and resource-efficient supervision, ensure the continuity and consistency of supervisory outcomes, and take due account of the statutory responsibilities and resources of other authorities. Cooperation should be guided by the principles of efficiency, proportionality, mutual trust and good faith, and should promote the effective use of resources while safeguarding ESMA’s independence and accountability for the performance of its tasks. To reflect the progressive build-up of ESMA’s supervisory capacity and to ensure the full and effective assumption of its supervisory tasks, the cooperation arrangements should be subject to regular review by ESMA.  (10) In certain circumstances, temporary exemptions or other transitional arrangements under Union financial services legislation may expire before the entry into force or full implementation of new or amended provisions introducing a permanent exemption, replacement framework, or new regulatory treatment. In addition, significant market developments may occur that render compliance with specific requirements under existing Union law temporarily disproportionate, operationally impracticable, or unduly burdensome in light of prevailing market conditions and the underlying regulatory objectives. To ensure legal certainty and regulatory continuity, and to avoid unnecessary market disruption, it is appropriate to provide that the no-action letter as set out in Article 9a of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 may also apply in cases where (i) a regulatory gap arises during the phasing-in of new requirements, or (ii) exceptional market conditions lead to disproportionate compliance burdens for market participants.  (11) To support cooperation between authorities and facilitate the new collaboration platforms, the Authority should develop a corresponding technological platform to facilitate the collection, storage, access to and processing of data and information. Th at data platform should contribute to high-quality data governance consistent with FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and also include the supervisory technology and other tools to enhance analysis and monitoring capabilities of the relevant authorities.  (12) In its capacity as processor of personal data, the Agency should implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the security, availability, maintenance and development of the software and IT infrastructure of the platform and that processing of personal data in the context of facilitating the access to and exchange of information on the platform in in line with Union law laying down the obligations to collect and exchange those data and in line with data protection laws. Where the Agency has the obligation to processes personal data pursuant other Union acts, the Agency should fulfil its obligations as controllers in regard to that information.  (13) In view of ESMA’s powers and competence over a broad category of entities and to ensure the effective, consistent exercise of its supervisory powers across sectors, it is appropriate to rationalise and consolidate in Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 the procedural framework for the exercise of supervisory tools necessary for the Authority to carry out its tasks. Those powers, which are currently dispersed across various sectoral Union acts should be replaced, to the extent possible, by a single horizontal framework applicable to all entities under the Authority’s direct supervision. That horizontal framework should provide a coherent set of procedural rules governing ESMA’s requests for information, investigations and on-site inspections, as well as the adoption of supervisory measures, fines and periodic penalty payments. S uch requests for and access to information, including during investigations and on-site inspections, may encompass personal data insofar as it is relevant and necessary for the performance of the Authority’s tasks, and any processing of such data sh ould comply with the applicable Union rules on the protection of personal data, in particular the principles of necessity, proportionality and purpose limitation. Moreover, that horizontal framework should ensure full respect for the rights of defence and for legal professional privilege, and provide for appropriate judicial protection, including the review of ESMA’s decisions by the Court of Justice of the European Union. By setting such a procedural framework in a coherent and uniform manner and abolishing sector-specific procedural provisions, the Union should enhance legal certainty, promote supervisory convergence and efficiency, and support the effective and accountable exercise of ESMA’s direct supervisory responsibilities. To avoid regulatory overlap or inconsistency , to ensure that the Authority exercises its powers in a n e ffective manner , to preserve the coherence of the Union acquis and respect the principle whereby specific rules take precedence over general rules, w here sectoral legislation contains specific provisions tailored to the procedural powers of the Authority in particular sectors or areas, those provisions should continue to apply  and , where appropriate, prevail over the general powers laid down in th at Regulation .  (14) Effective supervision and cooperation among competent authorities in the context of cross-border provision of financial services is essential to protect investors and foster trust and confidence in the financial system within the Union. For that purpose, ESMA should be equipped with enhanced supervisory convergence tools, including mechanisms to address supervisory failures and tools to facilitate cooperation and resolve disputes between competent authorities to ensure that financial market participants are subject to high-quality supervision.  (15) To address proven supervisory failures in the approval of financial products, services or entities operating across the Union, it is necessary to enable ESMA to require a competent authority to seek its opinion before granting approval where a peer review or an investigation reveals failures in supervision which could jeopardize the integrity of financial markets, financial stability, or investor protection. The peer review or investigation process, as set out in Article 22(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010, provides a robust and transparent framework for identifying supervisory failures and for taking corrective action. ESMA’s opinion should provide an additional layer of scrutiny and oversight, ensuring that financial products and services, and entities operating in the Union meet the highest standards of supervision. To prevent products , services or entities from entering the EU market without adequate supervision , it is necessary to enable ESMA to require in its opinion that competent authorities take corrective actions to address any shortcomings in supervision identified by ESMA.  (16) To facilitate regular and structured information exchange, propose solutions, and enhance cooperation to address common challenges and risks, and to support the overall goal of consistent and effective supervision, it is necessary to provide for collaboration platforms between competent authorities. Such platforms should be flexible, enabling ESMA to initiate or respond to requests from competent authorities, and should not prejudice the existing supervisory mandates and responsibilities of those competent authorities. Those collaboration platforms should also promote transparency, accountability, and a culture of compliance among financial market participants, with ESMA exercising its powers to resolve disputes and ensure compliance with Union law.  (17) Due to the lack of a mechanism for mutual recognition of administrative decisions, national competent authorities have significant difficulties in enforcing recovery of administrative fines in a cross-border context. To ensure effective enforcement of rules and the proper functioning of the single market in the area of financial services, it is necessary to introduce a mechanism for mutual recognition of decisions imposing an administrative fine and for assistance in executing requests to recover such a fine and such mechanism should be based on the principle of mutual trust. To that end, the grounds for a refusal to execute the request to recover an administrative fine should be limited to the minimum necessary.  (18) To ensure a consistent and transparent approach to the financing of ESMA’s supervisory activities, it is necessary to harmonise and consolidate the principles governing the levying of fees on entities under ESMA’s competence, which are currently set out separately in sectoral legislation conferring direct supervisory powers on ESMA. Establishing common principles on the scope, calculation, and transparency of such fees should promote a level playing field among entities across sectors, ensure the proportional application of supervisory costs, and provide legal certainty for both existing and new entities falling under ESMA’s competence. Those fees should cover all costs incurred by ESMA in the performance of its supervisory tasks, including, but not limited to, the costs of supervisory convergence work in the relevant sector, the development, operation and maintenance of IT tools and systems necessary for direct supervision, as well as the depreciated cost of such systems and related infrastructure. ESMA should be appropriately financed. It is therefore necessary to lay down that ESMA should be financed 50 % from Union funds and 50 % through contributions from Member States, made in accordance with the weighting of votes set out in Article 3(3) of the Protocol (No 36) on transitional provisions for the new tasks envisaged for ESMA by this Regulation that are not fee funded .  (19) In light of the future new competences of ESMA, its governance structure should be adapted accordingly. To ensure the effective and impartial functioning of ESMA it is necessary to strengthen its governance by introducing an independent Executive Board with full-time members, which should enhance its capacity to take swift and Union-oriented decisions, in particular for the supervision of financial market participants. The Executive Board, composed of the Chairperson and five independent full-time members with diverse supervisory experiences and expertise in the sectors under ESMA’s supervision, should be responsible for decisions addressed to financial market participants in supervisory matters. The Executive Board should also be responsible for decisions addressed to one or a limited number of competent authorities, including dispute settlements, breaches of Union law, and peer reviews.  These decisions are attributed to the Executive Board to increase the agility and reactivity of the decision-making and to ensure that the decisions take into account a common European interest. The Executive Board should also assume the competence of the current Management Board in preparing ESMA’s work programmes and budget. This should ensure effective, impartial and EU-oriented decisions. To ensure transparency and democratic control, the full-time members of the Executive Board should be appointed by the Council, based on a shortlist drawn up by the Commission and a proposal by the Board of Supervisors, following approval by the European Parliament.  (20) To ensure a clear division of responsibilities and effective checks and balances, the Board of Supervisors should remain ESMA’s main body for regulatory decisions and supervisory convergence. To enhance the Union dimension in the decision-making process within the Board of Supervisors its composition should be adjusted to include the full-time members of the Executive Board as voting members for supervisory decisions. To ensure a balanced approach and the consideration of national perspectives the Board of Supervisors should have the power to object to major supervisory decisions taken by the Executive Board within 10 days (or 48 hours in urgent cases), while the Executive Board should be required to report to the Board of Supervisors twice a year on its supervisory activities and should be able to request opinions on supervisory matters.  (21) It is necessary to streamline and align the review clause of the Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 with existing evaluation requirements for the agencies, as set out in the Joint Statement and Common Approach on EU decentralised agencies from July 2012, which provide for periodic evaluations every five years instead of three years. The targeted reviews provided for in that Regulation, starting five years after the date of entry into force, replace evaluations and enable the Commission to assess the relevant aspects of ESMA's performance after an adequate period of time has elapsed. This approach is consistent with the objective of reducing regulatory burdens and promoting a more targeted and effective regulatory framework, allowing for informed decisions on potential simplifications and improvements.  (22) Central counterparties (‘ CCPs ’) within the Union are currently authorised and supervised by the competent authorities of the Member States in which they are established, in cooperation with ESMA and CCP colleges. Despite progress achieved so far in harmonising supervisory activity for CCPs in the Union, diverging supervisory practices for CCPs amongst those national authorities across the Union persist, creating an unlevel playing field among CCPs within the Union. This increases the complexity of the Union CCP framework and places an additional burden and additional costs on CCPs within the Union, including when compared with Tier 2 CCPs directly supervised by ESMA. With the development of deeper, more liquid Union capital markets under the Savings and Investments Union, that unlevel playing field could increase the risk of, and incentives for, supervisory arbitrage which could in turn lead to financial stability issues. Therefore,  to ensure that the prudential, organisational and business conduct requirements for CCPs within the Union are applied in a uniform manner, in particular for CCPs with substantial clearing activity, CCPs with a material cross-border dimension, and CCPs that are part of a group that includes other market infrastructures that are supervised by ESMA, should be supervised by ESMA, based on its expertise and experience in the application of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council 16 . CCPs with low clearing activity and a more domestic standing, deemed less significant, should continue to benefit from the supervision of local authorities with a greater familiarity with domestic markets. 17  (23) To determine which CCPs authorised under Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 should be deemed significant and thus subject to supervision by ESMA, it is necessary to provide clear and objective criteria, which should reflect the activities and risks of the CCPs concerned. With the aim of simplification and of avoiding unnecessary administrative burden, an existing CCP determined as significant at a later stage, should not be re-authorised.  (24) National competent authorities supervising l ess significant CCPs should have stronger cooperation with ESMA to ensure a consistent approach to supervision and hence ensure a level playing field for CCPs . In case they wish to do so, Member States should have the option to designate ESMA as the competent authority for less significant CCPs established in their jurisdictions. Moreover, should a previously significant CCP no longer meet the conditions to be considered as such, a sufficient transition period should be granted to the national competent authority to allow it to prepare before formally taking over supervisory responsibilities for that CCP. Alternatively, the national competent authority should be able to leave the supervision of this previously significant CCP to ESMA. In addition, to ensure consistency and a level playing field between significant and less significant CCPs, ESMA should also be the authority responsible for authorising interoperability arrangements and for chairing the colleges for less significant CCPs. T he new supervisory arrangements for CCPs in the Union, in particular the role of ESMA as competent authority for significant CCPs , should be reflected in Regulation (EU) 2021/23 of the European Parliament and of the Council 18 .  (25) ESMA should closely cooperate with , and draw on the experience of , the bodies responsible for the oversight of CCPs authorised in the Union and with authorities experienced in the supervision of CCPs to benefit from the knowledge of those bodies . For that purpose, ESMA should develop comprehensive cooperation arrangements with those bodies and authorities, including the national competent authority in the Member State in which the CCP concerned is established, the European Central Bank, other central banks of issue of the most relevant Union currencies that the CCP processes, the competent authorities responsible for the supervision of the trading venues and the central securities depositories served by the CCP , and the competent authority responsible for the supervision of the most active clearing members . Those arrangements should set out the specific modalities and operational arrangements both in ongoing supervision and in exceptional circumstances, such as emergency situations .  (26) T he new supervisory responsibilities granted to ESMA and the changes to ESMA’s internal organisational structure, including the removal of the CCP Supervisory Committee, whose tasks should be assigned to the newly established Executive Board, should be reflected in Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 . Due to the unique status of third-country CCPs, the provisions concerning the procedures applying to them should remain in Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 rather than shifting those provisions to Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010. Furthermore, taking into account those changes, to further simplify the future organisational structure and working arrangements, and to remove unnecessary burden, significant CCPs should not be required to have a college . Similarly, given ESMA’s new supervisory responsibilities for significant CCPs, the requirements for ESMA opinions in relation to those CCPs should be removed . Supervisory arrangements for less significant CCPs should largely remain as they were as those CCPs have a more domestic scope and should benefit from the local knowledge and expertise of national authorities .  (27) Regulation (EU) 2024/791 of the European Parliament and of the Council 19 amended Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council 20 to remove obstacles to the emergence of consolidated tapes in bonds, shares and exchange-traded funds ('ETFs') and OTC derivatives. For a given share or ETF at any given timestamp, the provider of the consolidated tape is required to disseminate the European best bid and offer price (‘EBBO’) and the volume available at those prices across the Union. However, the consolidated tape would not disclose the identity of the trading venue of the EBBO, as it would not attribute the volumes that are available at the EBBO to individual trading venues, nor would it include bid and offer data beyond the EBBO and accompanying volumes. That significantly limits the value added of the consolidated tape, depriving its users of the ability to locate the volumes available at the EBBO and of a representative view of the depth of liquidity that is available for trading. Therefore, to further enhance its attractiveness, the consolidated tape for shares and ETFs should offer a more in-depth view of trading interests, covering the five best buying and selling prices, with the volumes available at those prices, and the indication of the individual trading venue on which those volumes are available.  (28) The closing price of the trading day is essential for equity markets as it provides a key reference price, typically used for the valuation of funds, ETFs and benchmarks. Most times, the closing price is derived from the closing auction that takes place on the trading venue where the securities were first admitted to trading (the ‘primary exchange’). The proportion of equity volumes traded at the closing auction has increased significantly over time. However, competition in the closing auction segment remains limited, with primary exchange closing auctions still capturing the largest share of closing auction trading. In addition, that situation raises resilience concerns, as incidents, including outages, on the primary exchanges may have a direct impact on the capacity of market participants to value their assets. To foster competition in the closing price segment and to ensure that market participants can rely on a closing price that is alternative to the closing auction price produced by the primary exchange, it is necessary to require the provider of the consolidated tape for shares and ETFs to disseminate a volume-weighted closing price resulting from all closing auctions operated by trading venues that are data contributors. ESMA should issue recommendations to specify the methodology that the consolidated tape should apply to determine the volume-weighted closing price.  (29) Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council 21 contains harmonised rules on the authorisation and operation of trading venues. However, the transposition of that Directive led to diverging national requirements. In addition, Member States complemented the transposed provisions with national requirements in instances where the Directive did not set out any requirements. That approach has resulted in an unlevel playing field, the fragmentation of the single market, and increased burden and costs for operators of trading venues located in several Member States and, eventually, the issuers and end-investors they serve. A more uniform framework is therefore necessary to level the playing field, avoid potential regulatory arbitrage, and support the development of activities across borders. It is therefore necessary to transfer requirements on the authorisation and operation of regulated markets and on the operation by an investment firm or a market operator of a multilateral trading facility (‘MTF’) or an organised trading facility (‘OTF’) from Directive 2014/65/EU to Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 and to further complement those provisions, notably to introduce harmonised rules in the areas that were previously subject to national legislation.  (30) The organisational requirements laid down in Article 19(3) and in Article 47 of Directive 2014/65/EU do not take into account whether a market operator or an investment firm operating a trading venue is part of a group. In particular, any intra-group arrangement for resource or function allocation between group entities is treated in the same way as an outsourcing arrangement entered into with entities outside the group. That approach fails to acknowledge the emergence of cross-border groups of trading venues and, as a result, limits the ability of those groups to enjoy group synergies and benefit from economies of scale, thus creating barriers to the cross-border allocation of resources and functions within a group. Additionally, allocating resources within a group, where all entities are subject to the same internal controls and procedures, carries a lower level of risk compared to outsourcing to external parties. The current approach, however, does not sufficiently distinguish between the risks associated with intragroup resource allocation and external outsourcing. Therefore, organisational requirements for trading venues should be simplified for trading venues that are part of a group and that intend to rely on the resources of or the performance of a function by another entity that is part of the same group and that is located in the Union. Such group arrangements should not be considered outsourcing for the purpose of Regulation No (EU) 600/2014, provided that certain conditions are met to ensure effective supervision. A trading venue that relies on the resources of or the performance of a function by another entity that is part of the same group should however remain fully responsible for the discharge of its obligations under Regulation No (EU) 600/2014. Given the increased supervisory risks, an intra-group arrangement that involves an entity located outside the Union should still be considered outsourcing.  (31) Article 53(6) of Directive 2014/65/EU sets out the right for a regulated market authorised in one Member State to provide appropriate arrangements on the territory of other Member States so as to facilitate access to and trading on that market by remote members or participants established in those other Member States. Directive 2014/65/EU does not expressly regulate other passporting rights for regulated markets, including the possibility to set up branches in other Member States. The absence of an explicit provision has led to diverging interpretations with respect to whether a regulated market may set up a branch in another Member State and with respect to the activities that a regulated market may perform under the passporting regime. It is important to enhance the clarity of the passporting regime for regulated markets by making it more explicit that regulated markets are able to seamlessly provide the activity, for which they have been authorised across the Union through the freedom to provide services or through the right of establishment. That includes, in addition to the provision of appropriate arrangements to facilitate access to and trading on that regulated market by remote members or participants established in other Member State, activities relating to the admission of members or participants on that regulated market and activities relating to the admission of financial instruments to trading on that regulated market. To ensure a level playing field between all trading venues, the same passporting regime should apply to market operators and investment firms operating an MTF or OTF.  (32) Directive 2014/65/EU currently requires that each regulated market in the Union is subject to an individual authorisation. It follows that market operators that intend to operate regulated markets in different Member States can only do so by seeking authorisation, for each individual regulated market that they intend to operate, from the competent authority of the home Member State, which is also responsible for the ongoing supervision of that market. That led to the situation where several Member States had introduced national laws to require, as a condition for the authorisation of a regulated market, that the market operator is a legal entity established in the Member State where a regulated market seeks authorisation. Due to that, groups operating regulated markets in several Member States cannot streamline their organisational structure and supervisory relationships, as they are obliged to maintain several supervised entities in different Member States. That significantly increases the costs and complexity of operating regulated markets across different Member States. To remove barriers and reduce operational costs for cross-border groups, it is necessary to remove the possibility for Member States to require the set-up of a separate legal entity in their territories as a condition for the authorisation of a regulated market. In addition, to further facilitate the cross - border operation of regulated markets, a new framework is introduced to allow legal persons that wish to operate more than one trading venue in more than one Member State to do so based on a single authorisation as a pan-European market operator (‘PEMO’) granted by ESMA. That new framework should not replace the existing authorisation and operation regime for regulated markets. Instead, it should apply on a voluntary basis to those entities that wish to operate under a single authorisation.  (33) The authorisation of a PEMO should list all the trading venues that the PEMO is authorised to operate. A PEMO that intends to operate additional trading venues should seek an extension of its original authorisation. To ensure that the supervisory arrangements of a PEMO are effectively simplified, the PEMO should not be required to seek individual authorisation for the trading venues that it operates in the Member States where those trading venues are situated or operated. Similarly, when a PEMO becomes the operator of an existing trading venue, the authorisation granted to that specific regulated market, or, in the case of MTFs or OTFs, to the market operator or investment firm for the purpose of operating that trading venue, should be deemed revoked upon the entry into effect of the authorisation to the PEMO or of the extended authorisation containing the amended list of the trading venues that that PEMO operates.  (34) Under Union and national laws, the territory where a trading venue is situated or operated is often used as the criterion to determine the national law that should apply to areas not directly governed by Union law, and to identify the competent authority. That includes Directive 2004/109/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, which establishes requirements in relation to the disclosure of periodic and ongoing information about issuers whose securities are already admitted to trading on a regulated market situated or operating within a Member State, and Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council, pursuant to which national competent authorities are required to ensure that market abuse provisions are applied on their territory regarding all actions carried out in relation to instruments admitted to trading or traded on a regulated market, an MTF or an OTF operating within their territory. A PEMO will operate, whether through the freedom to provide services or by establishing a branch, trading venues in multiple Member States on the basis of a single licence that is given to the PEMO itself and not to the trading venues that it operates. In the absence of an individual authorisation for each trading venue operated by a PEMO, and considering that the PEMO will operate all venues through one legal entity established in one Member State and operating cross-border, it is necessary that the PEMO determines, for each trading venues that it operates, the Member State in the territory of which that trading venue is to be considered to be situated or operated. This determination should depend on how the PEMO chooses to market its trading venue to companies seeking admission to trading on that trading venue or to members or participants admitted on that trading venue. The national laws of that Member State should apply to all matters relating to trading not governed by directly applicable Union law, where that application is dependent on the situation or operation of a trading venue. To ensure legal predictability, in cases where a PEMO becomes the operator of a trading venue that is already authorised, it is necessary to require that such trading venue is considered to be situated or operated in the Member State where it was initially authorised.  (35) ESMA assessed the trading activity of interest rate derivatives. It appeared from the assessment that forward rate agreements and single currency interest rate basis swaps are generally illiquid. To ensure that only the most standardised and liquid interest rate derivatives are subject to the transparency requirements, it is necessary  to exclude forward rate agreements and single currency interest rate basis swaps from transparency requirements.  (36) Article 14 of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 requires systematic internalisers that deal in sizes of up to and including two times the standard market size to make public firm quotes on a regular and continuous basis during normal trading hours in respect of those shares, depositary receipts, ETFs, certificates and other similar financial instruments traded on a trading venue, for which they are systematic internalisers and for which there is a liquid market. Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 requires systematic internalisers to execute orders they receive from their clients in respect of those instruments at the quoted prices at the time of reception of the order. That Article also allows systematic internalisers to execute clients’ orders at a better price provided that the price falls within a public range close to market conditions. To strengthen price formation for retail orders, it is necessary to ensure that, where a systematic internaliser executes a retail client’s order , specifically flagged as such, at a price that is better than the quoted price, that systematic internaliser immediately , and in any event before execution, updates the quoted price to reflect that price improvement. In addition, systematic internalisers should be obliged to transmit to the consolidated tape for shares and ETFs the data that they publish pursuant to Article 14 of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 to allow the consolidated tape to disseminate, for a given share or ETF, in addition to the best bids and offers for continuous order books, separately, the five best bid and offer quotes across the Union published by systematic internalisers with the indication of the individual systematic internaliser where those are offered. Those five best bid and offer quotes should correspond to the five best bid and offer quotes across all quotes for a given share or ETF published in the Union by different systematic internalisers.  (37) Article 21(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 requires investment firms which, either on own account or on behalf of clients, conclude transactions in OTC derivatives as referred to in Article 8a(2) of that Regulation, to make public the volume and price of those transactions and the time at which they were concluded through an Approved Publication Arrangement (‘APA’). To minimise burden for investment firms and to avoid the publication of misleading information, investment firms should not be required to publish through an APA the transactions in OTC derivatives that they conclude on a third-country trading venue, provided that the third-country trading venue (i) operates a multilateral system, (ii) is subject to authorisation, ongoing supervision and enforcement in accordance with the legal and supervisory framework of the third-country, and (iii) is subject to post-trade transparency provisions under which transactions concluded on that trading venue are published as soon as possible after the transaction was executed or, in clearly defined situations, after a deferral period. To ensure legal certainty and a high degree of supervisory convergence in the Union, ESMA should publish and regularly update a list of third-country trading venues that are considered to meet all criteria. Investment firms concluding transactions in OTC derivatives on third-country trading venues that do not meet all criteria should be required to make those transactions public in the Union through an APA.  (38) Articles 57 and 58 of Directive 2014/65/EU set out rules as regards the trading of commodity derivatives, emission allowances, and derivatives of emission allowances. Some of those rules are applicable to trading venues. As rules regarding the operation of trading venues are transferred from Directive 2014/65/EU to Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, it is appropriate to amend Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 to ensure that those rules are included in that Regulation.  (39) Articles 35 and 36 of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 provide for the conditions, under which trading venues can access the services of a central counterparty (‘CCP’), and under which CCPs can access the trade feeds of a trading venue. Those criteria have proven to be inappropriately framed and thus leave grounds for unjustified rejections or delays in granting access. In addition, the systematic involvement of national competent authorities renders the procedures excessively complex and burdensome. It is therefore appropriate to review those conditions for access to ensure rejections only occur in limited cases subject to the specific and justified conditions, to ensure that delays in granting access are avoided, and that ESMA is involved only in the case of conflicts between parties. In addition, trading venues may currently preclude two market participants executing a transaction on their venue from freely choosing different CCPs, even where those CCPs have established interoperability arrangements pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, and are therefore technically able to clear efficiently those transactions. Such market practices prevent the full exploitation of synergies that can be drawn from interoperability arrangements and increase costs of trading and clearing for market participants. In order to facilitate interoperable clearing, it is therefore necessary to prohibit trading venues from preventing access to their trade feeds for transactions involving two counterparties that have chosen to clear a transaction executed on their venue through two different CCPs that have established interoperability arrangements.  (40) Pursuant to Title VI of Directive 2014/65/EU, national competent authorities are currently responsible for the oversight of trading venues in the Union. On 20 March 2025 22 , the European Council adopted conclusions where it called for the improvement of the efficiency of supervision of Union capital markets and the reduction of their fragmentation. Furthermore, the Draghi and Letta reports 23 called for a more integrated supervision at the Union level. To reduce fragmentation and foster consistency in supervisory outcomes to support the establishment of a Savings and Investment Union, it is appropriate to confer on ESMA direct supervisory powers for significant trading venues with an important cross-border dimension. ESMA should also have direct supervisory powers over PEMOs. To determine what should be understood by ‘significant trading venues’, it is necessary to set out specific conditions. To avoid multiple supervisors for entities within the same group, it is also necessary to ensure that all entities that operate trading venues within the same group become subject to supervision by ESMA, once any entity within that group meets the conditions to be a significant trading venue. Similarly, all entities that operate trading venues in the group, in which at least one CCP or CSD is subject to supervision by ESMA, should also become subject to supervision by ESMA.  (41) For ESMA to ensure effective oversight over PEMOs and significant trading venues, ESMA should have the necessary supervisory powers, including the powers to conduct investigations and on-site inspections, to impose fines or periodic penalty payments to put an end to an infringement of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 , and to request the necessary information. To ensure that ESMA adequately performs its supervisory duties over PEMOs and significant trading venues, it is important that ESMA carries out such duties in close cooperation with national surveillance authorities. To avoid inefficient supervisory approaches resulting from double supervision, the involvement of national surveillance authorities should be limited to the powers and tasks explicitly conferred upon them by Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 and Directive 2014/65/EU.  (42) Considering the geographical proximity of national supervisors with the local ecosystems, it is necessary , for significant trading venues and PEMOs, that the responsibility for the surveillance of markets and oversight of issuers , remains with authorities that are competent at national level. Therefore, while ESMA should be in charge of enforcing the rules laid down in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 vis-à-vis significant trading venues and PEMOs and, where relevant, the rules laid down in Directive 2014/65/EU, including with respect to the assessment of effective systems and controls aiming to prevent and detect market abuse or the assessment of parameters for halting trading, national surveillance authorities should retain some powers to enable those authorities to perform market surveillance tasks or carry out duties necessary for the preservation of market integrity. Those powers should include the receipt of transaction data, the possibility to request order book data, or the adoption of urgent measures to impose temporary trading halts in emergency situations or suspend financial instruments from trading. When exercising their powers, national surveillance authorities should cooperate closely with ESMA.  (43) To ensure equal treatment as regards supervisory oversight of operators of trading venues, ESMA should become the competent authority for all relevant trading venues, including those operated by investment firms. It follows that ESMA should be entrusted with the authorisation and supervision of investment firms in case they wish to be exclusively authorised to operate relevant MTFs or OTFs. Investment firms that simultaneously operate MTFs or OTFs, that are subject to ESMA supervision, and perform other investment activities or provide other investment services should remain under national supervision for those other investment services and activities. To ensure that those investment firms maintain one point of entry and contact with a single supervising authority when seeking authorisation, it is necessary to introduce a specific framework for the authorisation of those investment firms. Where those investment firms wish to be initially authorised to perform other investment services together with the operation of MTFs or OTFs, the national competent authority of the Member State where those applicant investment firms are based should be entrusted with the authorisation, considering that their authorisation also covers other services that are not under ESMA supervision. Nevertheless, in those cases, to ensure ESMA can perform its duties as competent authority for relevant trading venues, it should provide the national competent authority with a binding opinion on the authorisation of the trading venues. The national competent authority concerned should not authorise the applicant investment firms to operate MTFs or OTFs in case of a negative opinion by ESMA. The same approach should be followed in case an investment firm, originally authorised to provide other investment services, wishes to extend its authorisation to the operation of MTFs or OTFs that are subject to ESMA supervision. In case of a negative opinion by ESMA, the extension of the authorisation should not be granted by the national competent authority. Lastly, where an investment firm authorised by ESMA to exclusively operate MTFs or OTFs seeks to extend its authorisation to other investment services, the national competent authority of the Member State where the investment firm is based should issue to ESMA a binding opinion on the provision of the additional investment services. In case of a negative opinion, ESMA should not extend the authorisation.  (44) To ensure that trading venues are subject to the most appropriate supervisory model, it is important to put in place a process whereby trading venues deemed significant are placed under ESMA’s supervision, while introducing the possibility for trading venues that no longer meet the conditions to be ‘significant’ to revert to national supervision. In that context, ESMA should identify which trading venues meet the conditions to qualify as significant, and should regularly monitor whether trading venues continue to meet those conditions over time. To ensure that the change of a supervisory model occurs smoothly and without causing excessive burden for trading venues, it is important to establish an appropriate timeline and a supervisory transition plan, developed through a thorough collaboration between ESMA and the national supervisory authority concerned. To provide clarity to market participants, ESMA should also establish and regularly update a list of all significant trading venues under its supervision and publish it on its website.  (45) Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council 24 sets out standardised requirements for the settlement of financial instruments and rules on the organisation and conduct of central securities depositories (CSDs) to promote safe, efficient and smooth settlement.  (46) In 2025, the Commission consulted stakeholders on their views on the barriers to the integration and modernisation of post-trading infrastructures in general, and on the barriers to the provision of cross-border services in the area of post trading in particular. The feedback indicated that stakeholders support and consider relevant the objective of Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 to promote safe, efficient and smooth settlement of financial instruments, but underlined the need to adapt that Regulation to technological innovation while ensuring fair competition between providers of settlement services.  (47) The concepts used and the rules laid down, in Regulation (EU) No 909/2014, should not hinder the use of any particular technology, including distributed ledger technology (DLT). To account for innovation and the application of new technologies in the provision of CSD services, in particular whe re those services are provided using DLT, Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 should be amended to ensure that all definitions, concepts and requirements should be update d so that they can be applied to situations in which a CSD provides its services using DLT. It is equally necessary to ensure that certain tokenised assets , including e-money tokens can be used as a means of payment when settling securities transactions or to pay penalties for settlement fails.  (48) Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 should take into account developments in DLT in the provision of CSD services so that entities authorised under the pilot regime provided for in Regulation (EU) 2022/858 25 can fall under the scope of Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 once they have outgrown that regime. Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 should also allow CSDs established in the Union that intend, from the very beginning, to provide CSD services in relation to DLT-based securities whose value would exceed the thresholds set out in Regulation (EU) 2022/858, to seek an authorisation directly under Regulation (EU) No 909/2014.  (49) Considering the significant volumes and values of securities transactions settled by settlement internalisers, it is important to strengthen the monitor ing of the potential legal and operational risks related to that activity. The granularity of volume and value reporting requirements for settlement internalisers should therefore be increased and information on settlement fails included in reports to facilitate such risk monitoring. In addition, to ensure that market participants can compare prices of settlement services provided by settlement internalisers with prices of those services provided by CSDs, settlement internalisers should disclose their prices and fees to their clients.  (50) CSDs in the Union are authorised and supervised by the competent authorities of the Member States in which they are established , in cooperation with a college of supervisors where th os e CSDs offer services of substantial importance in two or more host Member States. Despite progress so far, diverging supervisory practices for CSDs amongst those national authorities persist, creating an unlevel playing field among CSDs in the Union and increasing the costs and burden for CSDs and groups of CSDs operating and seeking to operate cross-border . With the development of deeper, more liquid Union capital markets under the SIU, that unlevel playing field increase s the risk of supervisory arbitrage which could lead to financial stability issues. T o ensure that the prudential, organisational and business conduct requirements for CSDs established in the Union are applied in a uniform manner, in particular for CSDs with substantial settlement activity, CSDs with a material cross-border dimension, and CSDs that are part of a group that includes other market infrastructures that are supervised by ESMA, should be supervised by ESMA, based on its expertise and experience in the application of Regulation (EU) No 909/2014.  (51) To determine which CSDs authorised under Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 should be subject to supervision by ESMA, it is necessary to lay down clear and objective criteria for their identification, including criteria based on size and cross-border activity. With the aim of simplification and of avoiding unnecessary administrative burden, a CSD that has already been authorised should not be re-authorised by ESMA once it becomes significant .  (52) Given CSDs’ central role in securities markets, their connection to other financial market infrastructures and the fact that most of the volume of settlement transactions in CSDs in the Union happens in central bank money, ESMA should develop deep and comprehensive cooperation arrangements with other authorities, in particular the ECB and other central banks of issue of the most relevant Union currencies that the CSDs settle in. Such cooperation arrangements should cover the close involvement of those other authorities in the daily supervision of significant CSDs and should include arrangements for regular events, such as onsite inspections, and ad hoc events, such as emergency situations.  (53) The amendments to Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010, and in particular the changes to ESMA’s internal organisational structure and the shift in supervisory responsibilities, should be reflected in Regulation (EU) No 909/2014. In addition, taking into account the shift in supervisory responsibilities, the involvement of national competent authorities in ESMA’s governance structure, and to avoid any duplicative assignment of tasks between ESMA and the supervisory college, significant CSDs should no longer be required to have a college.  (54) As opposed to significant CSDs, less significant CSDs d o not have substantial cross-border activities. They should therefore remain under the supervision of their national competent authorities. Supervisory arrangements for less significant CSDs should largely remain as they were. However, to ensure a consistent supervisory approach for those CSDs, it is necessary to provide for stronger cooperation between those national competent authorities with ESMA. In case they wish to do so, Member States should have the option to designate ESMA as the competent authority for less significant C SD s established in their jurisdictions. Moreover, should a previously significant C SD no longer meet the conditions to be considered as such, a sufficient transition period should be granted to the national competent authority to allow it to prepare before formally taking over supervisory responsibilities for that C SD . Alternatively, the national competent authority should be able to leave the supervision of this previously significant CSD to ESMA. In addition, to ensure consistency and a level playing field between significant and less significant CSDs, ESMA should also be the authority responsible for authorising interoperability arrangements such as, in the context of CSD services, interoperable links. For these purposes, ESMA should also be responsible for chair ing the colleges for less significant CSDs.  (55) To modernise the exchange of information and to allow for faster procedures , ESMA should establish and maintain an electronic central database in the form of a platform. All relevant competent authorities and bodies referred to in Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 should have access to such platform for the information that is pertinent for their tasks and responsibilities. E ntities subject to Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 should have access to the information and documentation they have submitted and any documentation that is addressed to them. T o ensure the swift and efficient sharing of information and documentation under Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 , t he central database should be used to share as much information and documentation as possible.  (56) To allow groups of CSDs to benefit from their consolidation, Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 should enable CSDs that are part of a group to outsource their core services to CSDs that are part of the same group. In addition, situations where a CSD wish es to provide its core services by using a DLT solution it developed should not be considered as outsourcing but rather as an extension of the CSD’s authorisation.  (57) The requirement to ensure the integrity of securities’ issuance applies equally to conventional CSDs and CSDs using DLT. For CSDs using DLT , the rules should take into account the specific ways in which DLT works by allow ing for appropriate reconciliation measures to be performed by nodes verifying that the number of securities making up a securities issue or part of a securities issue submitted to the CSD is equal to the sum of securities recorded on the securities accounts of the participants of the securities settlement system operated by the CSD.  (58) CSDs should be able to take advantage of the functionality offered by a common settlement infrastructure offering securities settlement with central bank money, in particular where such common settlement infrastructure provides for liquidity optimisation tools and promotes safe and efficient settlement , including across borders. T o give to their participants the possibility to settle their securities transactions on that common settlement infrastructure, CSDs that offer settlement in currencies available on such a common settlement infrastructure should be required to directly connect to it. The requirement to connect to a common settlement infrastructure should take into account the technological developments in the area of central bank money settlement.  (59) Regulation (EU) 11 1 4/2023 of the European Parliament and of the Council 26 sets out a framework for the safe issuance in the Union of e-money tokens. To support innovation in securities settlement, CSDs in the Union should be able to settle the payments of securities transactions in e-money tokens, subject to appropriate safeguards. Th at possibility should be available to both CSDs that are authorised to provide banking-type ancillary services and CSDs that are not. CSDs that are not authorised to provide banking-type ancillary services should be able to settle the payments in e-money tokens, in any currency, through accounts opened with CSDs that are authorised to provide banking-type ancillary services or through accounts opened with a credit institution, subject to the threshold determined by EBA for the settlement of payments in commercial bank money.  (60) Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 sets out rules for the establishment and the maintenance of link arrangements set up between CSDs. To foster the provision of cross-border services, the access to another CSD in the Union via a standard link should be facilitated and the related process simplified. In addition, with the aim of fostering further integration of Union capital markets, CSDs should be required to establish a minimum number of bilateral links. To ensure proportionality, the number of links a CSD should be required to establish should depend on the significance of the CSD.  (61) This amending Regulation introduces targeted amendments to Regulation (EU) 2019/1156 with the aim of removing barriers to the cross-border marketing of AIFs and UCITS, harmonising rules on marketing communications and strengthening ESMA’s powers to foster a common supervisory culture and better coordinate activities across home and host national competent authorities.  (62) The marketing of AIFs and UCITS is not always conducted by the AIFM, EuVECA or EuSEF manager, or UCITS management company directly but by one or several distributors either on behalf of those managers or on their own behalf. Arrangements whereby a distributor acts on behalf of the AIFM, EuVECA or EuSEF manager, or UCITS management company should be considered to be delegation arrangements subject to the provisions of Directive 2011/61/EU, Regulation (EU) No 345/2013, Regulation (EU) No 346/2013 and Directive 2009/65/EC regarding delegation. To ensure legal clarity, Regulation (EU) 2019/1156 is amended to clarify that where the marketing function is delegated to a third party acting on behalf of the AIFM, EuVECA or EuSEF manager, and UCITS management company, the latter remain responsible for ensuring that the marketing communications prepared and addressed to investors are compliant with the requirements of that Regulation. On the other hand, where a distributor acts on its own behalf and markets an AIF or UCITS under Directive 2014/65/EU or through life-insurance based investment products in accordance with Directive (EU) 2016/97, the provisions of Directive 2011/61/EU and Directive 2009/65/EC regarding delegation do not apply. Regulation (EU) 2019/1156 is therefore amended to clarify that in those cases where the marketing function is performed by one or several distributors acting on their own behalf, those distributors (and not the AIFM or UCITS management company) are liable to ensure that the marketing communications that they prepare and address to investors are compliant with the requirements of this Regulation.  (63) To reduce unnecessary delays and divergent supervisory practices and to facilitate the seamless marketing of AIFs and UCITS in the Single Market, it is appropriate that Regulation (EU) 2019/1156 prohibits the competent authorities of the host Member State from requiring the notification of marketing communications as a prior condition for the marketing of AIFs and UCITS in their territory. In order to protect investors in the host Member State and improve supervisory cooperation and effectiveness, where the competent authorities of the host Member State have reasonable grounds to believe that marketing communications are not in compliance with Regulation (EU) 2019/1156 or the relevant Commission delegated acts, they retain the right to request the competent authorities of the home Member State of the AIFM, EuVECA or EuSEF manager or UCITS to take all appropriate measures to prevent or penalise further irregularities. The competent authorities of host Member States may further refer the matter to ESMA if they are not satisfied with the actions taken by the home competent authorities.  (64) In order to ensure high levels of transparency on the fees or charges levied by host competent authorities for carrying out their duties in relation to AIFs and UCITS marketed in their territory and to facilitate the recovery of those fees or charges, ESMA should publish up to date information on the amount of fees or charges levied by each host competent authority, their frequency and the modalities of their payment. To ensure consistency of the fees or charges levied by competent authorities, ESMA should , every 2 years, analyse whether such fees or charges are consistent with the overall cost relating to the performance of the functions of the competent authorities and submit a report to the Commission on that basis.  (65) To facilitate the marketing of AIFs and UCITS across the Union and to optimise the interactions and the exchange of information between home and host Member States, it is appropriate and necessary for ESMA to establish a “one-stop-shop” for the cross-border marketing of AIFs and UCITS, that would allow competent authorities to easily transmit and exchange information and documentation on marketing notifications. It is therefore essential that ESMA develops a data platform for marketing notifications and de-notifications that would be accessible to all competent authorities. UCITS and AIFMs should provide all information and documentation necessary for the marketing of AIFs and UCITS across the Union, including any amendments thereof to the competent authorities of their home Member State and the latter will in turn transmit them to  ESMA through that data platform. All relevant host competent authorities should have immediate and direct access to the information and documentation in connection with the UCITS and AIFs marketed in their territory through the data platform. The data platform will simplify and expedite the passporting procedure for UCITS and AIFMs, allowing for immediate Single Market access upon their authorisation, as well as increasing transparency and cooperation among competent authorities. To fund the expenditure relating to the new passporting procedure, including the appropriate share of maintenance costs of the data platform that is utilised for that purpose, ESMA should charge UCITS and AIFMs a fee when they avail of the passporting based on authorisation procedure. The fee structure should be commensurate to the number of host Member States in which the units of UCITS or AIFs are marketed.  (66) To ensure a consistent implementation and greater harmonisation of marketing requirements and notification procedures across Member States, the provisions of Directive 2011/61/EU and Directive 2009/65/EC as regards the marketing of EU AIFs managed by EU AIFMs to professional investors and the marketing of UCITS across the Union are transferred to Regulation (EU) 2019/1156.  (67) EU AIFMs marketing EU AIFs to professional investors, and UCITS marketing their units across the Union, are already authorised and subject to strict regulatory safeguards and prudential requirements. However, the cross-border marketing of UCITS and AIFs remains hampered by lengthy notification procedures and divergent national requirements and administrative practices, including obligations relating to translations, the appointment of local agents and differing national deadlines. Those divergences hinder the functioning of the internal market, as UCITS and AIFs must navigate a patchwork of national rules and processes when operating in several Member States. It is therefore necessary to streamline marketing notification and de-notification procedures, shorten processing times and remove national requirements that create obstacles to the cross-border marketing of investment funds. For that purpose, Regulation (EU) 2019/1156 is amended to allow UCITS and AIFMs, at the time of their authorisation, to notify their home Member State of their intention to market units or shares of UCITS or AIFs in other Member States through a simplified procedure. Once the home Member State has received the required information and documentation through the authorisation application , it should transmit it to the ESMA data platform. That information should be automatically accessible to host Member States and, from the moment of its transmission to the data platform, UCITS and AIFs should enjoy unrestricted access to the markets of those Member States.  (68) The de-notification of marketing arrangements should likewise be subject to the simplified procedure, allowing UCITS and AIFMs to notify their intention to terminate marketing activities in a host Member State to their home competent authority, who will in turn notify the relevant host Member States and ESMA through the data platform.  (69) Although the requirement of a physical presence as a precondition for the marketing of UCITS and AIFs in a host Member State is prohibited, Member States often require, through market practice or otherwise, the appointment of a local agent to conduct certain tasks locally. Such practices undermine the functioning of the Single Market and generate unnecessary costs and complexity for funds marketed across the Union. It is therefore necessary to clarify that host Member States should not impose, through market practice or otherwise, any form of physical local presence obligation on UCITS and AIFs marketed in their territory, even where such presence is not formally a precondition for marketing but creates additional burdens or places those funds at a disadvantage compared to domestic funds.  (70) To ensure greater harmonisation in the exercise of supervisory powers by the competent authorities of home and host Member States, the provisions of Directive 2011/61/EU and Directive 2009/65/EC concerning supervisory powers over UCITS and AIFs marketed across the Union should be transferred into Regulation (EU) 2019/1156. In order to promote effective cooperation between home and host competent authorities and to ensure that any potential disagreements are resolved efficiently and without creating obstacles to the marketing of UCITS and AIFs within the Union, it is necessary to clarify that the competent authorities of host Member States should refer to ESMA any matters of disagreement with the competent authorities of the home Member State of the UCITS or AIFM, or cases where the host Member State considers that the marketing of a UCITS or AIF should be prohibited in its territory. In such cases, ESMA should resolve the matter in accordance with its powers to address cross-border issues.  (71) To ensure the effective functioning of the Single Market for investment funds and remove supervisory obstacles that impede the cross-border exercise of passporting rights, ESMA should be empowered to detect and address instances of divergent, duplicative, redundant or deficient supervisory practices that hinder the cross-border marketing of UCITS and AIFs or instances where the cross-border marketing of UCITS or AIFs does not comply with Union law. In those cases, ESMA should implement an escalation process, starting with engaging with competent authorities and stakeholders, fostering greater collaboration between them and, where necessary, using its convergence and intervention powers so that unjustified restrictions on cross-border activities or cases of non-compliance with EU law are remedied in a timely and effective manner. For the same reasons, it is necessary to ensure that, if those problems persist despite this escalation process, ESMA should then exercise its powers to launch breach of Union law procedures in accordance with Article 17 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010, to suspend the right to market UCITS or AIFs on a cross-border basis in accordance with Article 17aaa of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 , to arrange binding mediation in accordance with Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 or to organise collaboration platforms in accordance with A rticle 19a of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 , where appropriate, in order to effectively remedy those problems.  (72) To ensure consistent supervision and effective cooperation between competent authorities of Member States, competent authorities should be able to refer to ESMA any disagreements on assessments, actions, or omissions in areas where Regulation (EU) 2019/1156 requires coordination, so that ESMA can intervene using the powers conferred on it under Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.  (73) It is necessary to amend Regulation (EU) 2021/23 to account for ESMA’s new role as the supervisor of significant CCPs and the abolition of colleges for th ose CCPs .  (74) Whereas Regulation (EU) 2022/858 was adopted to promote the uptake of distributed ledger technology (DLT) in the financial sector, by providing for an EU pilot regime that allows market participants to experiment with the use of DLT for the trading and settlement of financial instruments. Three years after the entry into application of the Regulation, its uptake remains moderate , with a limited number of approved applicants, despite a growing interest in the market in using DLT for financial services. In line with the objective set in the priorities for achieving the Savings and Investment Union of enhancing the interoperability, interconnection and efficiency of EU trading and post-trading infrastructures, it appears justified to review the current regulatory setting of Regulation (EU) 2022/858 to ensure that the DLT Pilot Regulation is better capable of accompanying regulated firms wanting to leverage DLT for trading and post-trading . To achieve this objective, the review broadly comprises two sets of amendments: firstly, those that aim to increase the flexibility and proportionality of the framework and, secondly, those that aim to extend its scale and scope.  (75) DLT is used, among others, for the issuance, recording and transferring of financial instruments. As such, where appropriate operational risk management is implemented by its users, it does not make the financial instruments managed through DLT inherently riskier than the instruments managed based on other, functionally analogous technologies. Therefore, the scope of eligible assets and financial instruments admitted to trading on a DLT market infrastructure, or to be recorded on a DLT market infrastructure under this Regulation should be expanded to cover all financial instruments, regardless of their type, subject to appropriate application of investor protection rules.  (76) Regulation (EU) 2022/858 lays down various limits to the scale of activities carried out under the Pilot, with limits to the issuance size and market capitalisation of assets eligible for the DLT Pilot (asset-specific caps), and an aggregate cap that limits the total value of financial instruments intermediated by a DLT market infrastructure of EUR 6 billion. Those activity thresholds have made it difficult for certain large market participants to use the Pilot framework for their activity and develop large scale business models. Therefore, all asset-specific caps should be withdrawn, whereas the aggregate cap should be raised to EUR 100 billion. To mitigate risks from increased activity, those changes should be accompanied by targeted increases in prudential requirements for those Pilot participants providing CSD services that wish to benefit from increased thresholds.   At the same time, to make it easier for small innovative companies to use the DLT Pilot for their activities , a simplified regime comprising obligations that are proportionate to the risk and size of those companies should be established. The simplified regime should be open to operators of a DLT TSS or a DLT SS where the aggregate market value of all DLT financial instruments that they service does not exceed EUR 10 billion at the moment of admission to trading or initial recording of a new DLT financial instrument.  (77) Regulation (EU) 2022/858 limits the types of eligible entities that can participate in the Pilot, which have to be either trading venues authorised under Directive 2014/65 or CSDs. That approach excludes regulated financial entities that have an interest and experience in organising trading and transfers of digital assets to participate in the Pilot, namely the crypto-assets services providers (CASP) that operate trading platforms. Therefore, those CASPs should be allowed, under certain conditions and subject to their compliance with the relevant requirements set out in Directive 2014/65, Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 and Regulation (EU) No 909/2014, as applicable, to obtain a specific permission to operate a DLT trading venue (DLT TV) or a DLT trading and settlement system (DLT TSS). Accordingly, the rules laid down for entities operating DLT market infrastructure should be apply to CASPs.  (78) Regulation (EU) 2022/858 grants its participants the possibility to request exemptions from specific provisions of the sectoral legislation. However, certain provisions of sectoral legislation may be identified as incompatible with DLT only by applicants to the Pilot themselves, as they develop their business models and apply for a permission to operate a DLT market infrastructure, or after obtaining the permission. To ensure flexibility of the Pilot regime in supporting innovation, the competent authorities should be allowed to grant requests for exemptions from provisions belonging to the specified parts of sectoral legislation under certain conditions. Such requests should be based on clear justification by the DLT TV or DLT SS operators that the required exemption is incompatible or disproportionate with the use of DLT, and should be accompanied, where appropriate, with compensatory measures that can achieve the objective of the provision for which the exemption is requested. To ensure supervisory convergence between competent authorities granting the exemptions, ESMA should be closely involved in granting the requests by issuing non-binding opinions on the requests and assessments made by the competent authorities.  (79) Finding robust solutions for settlement of the cash leg in commercial bank money may be more difficult in the nascent market of DLT market infrastructures. To support operators of a DLT SS or a DLT TSS in finding efficient solutions for processing commercial bank money payments within their settlement systems, they should be able to designate credit institutions whose banking activities are not limited to CSDs but otherwise comply with Title IV of Regulation (EU) No 909/2014. Furthermore, to increase legal certainty for existing projects developed under the Pilot, settlement in commercial bank money executed by an investment firm operating a DLT TSS should be explicitly recognised, provided it sufficiently monitors the risks arising from its settlement model .  (80) Since e-money tokens have emerged as one of the most widely used means of DLT-based settlement, further legal clarity should be provided for the use of e-money tokens in the Pilot. To recognise that Regulation (EU) 2023/1114, adopted after Regulation (EU) 2022/858, governs the services of custody of e-money tokens , it should be specified that e-money tokens cash accounts for the purpose settlement may be provided by a set of appropriately regulated financial institutions, including CASPs. However, it should be laid down that most banking type ancillary services with regards to e-money tokens , other than providing cash accounts and processing payments, may be provided only by credit institutions.  Furthermore, to promote the use of e-money tokens denominated in Union currencies and to protect the market from foreign exchange risk, settlement of payments for assets denominated in Union currencies should be carried out in e-money tokens referencing EU currencies. To support the development of euro denominated stablecoins, DLT market infrastructures should be encouraged to offer settlement in e-money tokens denominated in euro , even if the financial instrument that is settled is denominated in a non-EU currency.  (81) It is necessary to ensure that small businesses seeking to innovate are subject to requirements of Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 that are proportionate to their size and risk . For that reason , operators of a DLT SS or a DLT TSS benefiting from the simplified regime should , with regard to the provision of CSD services, only be subject to those provisions of Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 that are essential to ensure safe and robust provision of CSD services, while not setting a burdensome compliance standard. For the same reason , and to ensure that the delegated regulations adopted pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 are made proportionate to the risk and size of small businesses operating under the simplified regime, ESMA should be instructed to amend those delegated regulations for the needs of the simplified regime. To ensure that the requirements applicable to the Pilot participants become more stringent as businesses scale and risks increase, DLT market infrastructures wishing to transition to from the simplified to the regular regime should comply with all of the requirements of Regulation (EU) No 909/2014, as adapted and derogated from by Regulation (EU) 2022/858 . Given the novelty of the simplified regime for the activities of the DLT settlement system (DLT SS) or the DLT trading and settlement system (DLT TSS) introduced in this regulation, and to ensure supervisory convergence by competent authorities, ESMA should be mandated to issue guidelines on the implementation of that simplified regime .  (82) Distributed ledgers act as platforms on which financial intermediaries may provide financial services in a synchronised manner. In order to allow market participants to leverage the platform nature of distributed ledgers, the Pilot should make it possible for eligible financial entities to obtain a specific permission to perform an individual CSD service within the territory of the Union. Therefore, a legal person who is authorised as an investment firm, a regulated market, a credit institution, a CSD, or a CASP should be allowed to perform the DLT notary service or the DLT central maintenance service under the Pilot. To ensure these services are provided in accordance with the standards laid down in Regulation (EU) No 909/2014, while taking into account the specificities of DLT, DLT notaries and DLT account keepers should be subject to the provisions of that regulation that govern the application of the notary and the central maintenance service and the additional requirements for DLT market infrastructures set out in Regulation (EU) 2022/858.  (83) DLT financial instruments issued and safeguarded by the DLT notary and DLT account keepers outside a CSD should only be settled through a DLT SS, DLT TSS or a CSD operating solely under Regulation (EU) No 909/2014.  Furthermore, given the experimental nature of this model for the distributed provision of CSD services, the market value of DLT financial instruments issued and safeguarded by DLT notaries and DLT account keepers should be limited by allowing operators of a DLT SS, DLT TSS or a CSD operating solely under Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 to admit for settlement up to EUR 10 billion of market value of such instruments, which should be increased to EUR 30 billion of market value for transferable securities issued by SMEs.  (84) To reflect the distributed nature of roles and responsibilities that is possible under the Pilot with the creation of the DLT notary and DLT account keeper function, it should be made clear that where, for a given DLT financial instrument, a DLT notary or a DLT account keeper provides CSD core services jointly with a DLT SS, TSS or a CSD operating solely under Regulation (EU) No 909/2014, the DLT SS, TSS or CSD operating solely under Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 should not be liable for compliance with those requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 that are discharged by the DLT notary or a DLT account keeper.  (85) To ensure transparency on the market about joint provision of CSD services, ESMA should enter the information about each of the DLT notary and the DLT central maintenance service s operated by a specific DLT SS, TSS or a CSD operating solely under Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 in the CSD register maintained under Article 21 of Regulation (EU) No 909/2014.  (86) Additionally, because distributed ledgers allow its users to more easily synchronise and automate operations, the Pilot should allow market participants to experiment with a new business model that does not involve a single operator of a settlement system, but rather relies on regulated entities that are individually and jointly required, through the establishment of a settlement scheme, to ensure robust settlement outcomes. Given their experimental nature, these business models should be subject to the same thresholds as those applicable to DLT market infrastructures settling DLT financial instruments issued and safeguarded by DLT notaries and DLT account keepers. Additionally, to further mitigate risks stemming from this new business model, the eligible participants to settlement schemes should only be DLT account keepers, the settlement should be conducted through central bank money accounts managed by those DLT account keepers, and should be settled on a ‘ delivery versus payment’ basis . Additionally, to ensure the sound functioning of the settlement scheme, its participants should ensure safe, efficient and smooth settlement, protection of client assets and robust risk management of operations. In particular, to ensure robust management of credit and liquidity risks stemming from providing banking services to their clients, DLT account keepers participating in the scheme should comply with a set of prudential requirements on an ongoing basis. To ensure this compliance, the settlement scheme should be authorised and supervised by ESMA, in cooperation with competent authorities of the DLT account keepers participating in the scheme.  (87) To facilitate the development of DLT CSD services across Member States, DLT notaries and DLT account keepers should be allowed to provide CSD services throughout the Union, without being required to have a physical presence in the territory of a host Member State as long as they submit a list of the Member States in which they intend to provide CSD services to the competent authority of their home Member State , which is requested to then share this list with the competent authorities of the relevant host Member States and ESMA before t he DLT notary or the DLT account keeper may begin to provide CSD services in those host Member State s.  (88) To ensure that DLT market infrastructures do not fragment the Union’s trading and post-trading infrastructure and that they form a part of an integrated capital market DLT market infrastructures participa ting in the Pilot, as well as other interested parties, should form an industry group for the purpose of establish ing industry standards that facilitate settlement of DLT financial instruments between DLT market infrastructures . Building on the work of that industry group, ESMA should provide technical advice to the Commission on supporting interoperability between DLT market infrastructures.  (89) C olleges of supervisors should be established t o ensure the efficient supervision of the novel business models for CSD services allowed under the Pilot and the necessary cooperation and exchange of information between all the supervisors that those business models may involve . Firstly, colleges of supervisors should be established in accordance with Article 24a of Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 where a DLT SS or a DLT TSS operating under the regular regime provides CSD services and fulfils the conditions set out in that article. To ensure comprehensive involvement of all relevant authorities, competent authorities of the DLT notary or the DLT account keeper that is involved in the provision of CSD services and EBA, where e-money tokens are used for the settlement of payments , should be allowed to join the college of supervisors. Secondly, ESMA should also establish and chair a college of supervisors for settlement schemes, comprising ESMA, the competent authorities of DLT account keepers participating in the settlement scheme and the central bank in the Union of the currency that is or will be used for the settlement of cash payments in the settlement scheme. Competent authorities of DLT notaries participating in the settlement scheme should be able to participate in the college upon request.  (90) To remove any ambiguity in relation to the long-term viability of the Pilot, the time limits for the duration of the permissions granted in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2022/858 should no longer apply .  (91) Well-integrated crypto-asset markets depend on coordinated supervisory frameworks to operate efficiently, while more centralised supervision can, in turn, promote deeper market integration. Centralising supervisory powers and capacities at Union’s level, including by transferring direct supervisory responsibilities in the area of crypto-asset service providers is a critical element to further develop the mutually reinforcing dynamic between market integration and supervisory alignment.  (92) Because crypto-asset service providers are a new area of financial activity which has only recently come under supervision and because it is important to ensure supervisory consistency from the beginning, ESMA should exercise that centralised supervision, thereby guaranteeing a level playing field.  Crypto-asset services is also an area dominated by increased cross-border activity carried out using electronic means and new technology. Risks should therefore be monitored and addressed in a comprehensive and consistent manner. Centralised oversight should ensure the consistent application of standards and rules, mitigate supervisory gaps across jurisdictions and address the disproportionate impact a potential failure of crypto-asset service providers could have on the Union’s crypto-asset ecosystem. Centralised supervision should mean the danger of supervisory fragmentation will not materialise.  (93) In the fight against market abuse of crypto-assets admitted to trading or of which a request for admission to trading has been made, centralised market surveillance by ESMA and investigation powers for cross border cases should achieve economies of scale, overcome the issue of fragmented access to data, reduce reliance on international cooperation and ultimately give ESMA a better view over complex strategies taking place across jurisdictions.  (94) In this respect, ESMA should be responsible for the authorisation and supervision of the crypto-asset service providers and ongoing monitoring for market abuse in the crypto-asset sector.  (95) Certain firms subject to Union legislative acts on financial services are already allowed to provide all or some crypto-asset services without being required to obtain an authorization as a crypto-asset service provider under Regulation (EU) 2023/1114. These entities should continue to be supervised for their crypto-asset activities by the competent authorities that granted them authorisation under other Union acts. However, where the provision of crypto-asset services becomes the main activity of those entities, they should be treated as crypto-asset service providers and the supervision for all their activities should be transferred to ESMA. To fulfil this duty, ESMA should establish cooperation agreements with the competent authorities that authorised those entities under other Union legislative acts on financial services. On the basis of the cooperation agreement, those competent authorities shall provide support and assistance to ESMA in the supervision of the activities that are not covered by Regulation (EU) 2023/1114.  (96) As there is already a centralized system of banking supervision in the Union in the form of the Single Supervisory Mechanism, ensuring integration and consistency in the supervision of the activities of credit institutions, there should be no transfer of supervisory powers where the entity providing crypto-asset services is a credit institution.  (97) To supervise crypto-asset service providers, ESMA should have the powers to suspend or, prohibit the provision of a crypto-asset service, to withdraw the authorisation of a crypto-asset service provider, to investigate infringements of the rules on market abuse, to request information, to carry out on-site inspections and investigations, to take supervisory measures and to impose fines. When determining the type and level of an administrative penalty or other administrative measure, ESMA should take into account all relevant circumstances, including the gravity and the duration of the infringement and whether it was committed intentionally. In order to carry out its supervisory duties, ESMA should cooperate and be assisted by other competent authorities as well as the competent authorities responsible for the supervision of [Directive (EU) 2015/849].  (98) E SM A should charge fees to crypto-asset service providers to cover its costs for supervision , including for overheads , and the cost of conducting market surveillance to prevent market abuse . T he fee should be proportionate to the size of the crypto-asset service provider. T o avoid disruption to existing crypto-asset service providers , it is necessary to lay down transitional provisions for crypto-asset service providers that have been authorised pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2023/1114 and for applicants whose application for a crypto-asset service provider authorisation is currently being assessed by national competent authorities . For reasons of legal certainty, it is also appropriate to establish clear transitional measures for the transmission of files and working documents from the competent authorities to ESMA.  (99) T o avoid disruption to existing crypto-asset service providers, t he authorisation of a crypto-asset service provider by a competent authority should remain valid throughout the Union after the transition of supervisory powers from the competent authorities to ESMA.  (100) In order to fulfil the objectives of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the adoption of rules of procedures for the exercise of ESMA’s power to charge fees, for the imposition of fines and a settlement procedure, including the rights of defence, disclosure and effects of settlements. In addition, in order to ensure the effectiveness of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the specification of the fees to be paid to ESMA for the supervision of significant CCPs, the matters for which those fees are due, the calculation of the amount of those fees, and the manner in which those fees are to be paid , and in respect of amending the list of infringements for which ESMA can impose supervisory measures on significant CCPs. Furthermore, to ensure the effectiveness and the consistent application of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the specification of the fees to be paid by operators of the trading venues that are subject to supervision by ESMA, in respect of the conditions and methodologies used to determine whether a trading venue should be deemed significant, and in respect of the conditions under which a trading venue or a CCP should grant access to its services. In parallel, in order to ensure the effectiveness of Regulation (EU) No 909/2014, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the specification of the type of fees to be paid to ESMA for the supervision of significant CSDs, the matters for which those fees are due, the calculation of the amount of those fees and the manner in which they are to be paid; amending the list of infringements for which ESMA can impose supervisory measures; the further specification of the requirements applicable to the participation in a CSD, and the amendment of the conditions under which a CSD shall be subject to the obligation to establish bilateral links. In addition, in order to ensure that the activity thresholds laid down in Regulation (EU) 2022/858 can be modified in light of market developments and policy learnings from the pilot regime established by that act, the power to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the adaptation of those thresholds to, among others, market conditions and possible risks to financial stability. Furthermore, in order to ensure the effectiveness of Regulation (EU) 2023/1114, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of further specifying the type and the calculation of the amount of supervisory fees that ESMA can charge to the crypto-asset service providers. Lastly, to ensure an orderly application of provisions transferred from Directive 2014/65/EU to Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, it is appropriate to ensure that delegated acts and implementing acts that have been adopted on the basis of empowerments laid down in Directive 2014/65/EU that are to be transferred to Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, continue to apply. The Commission should be empowered to amend those delegated and implementing act in accordance with the procedures set out in Article 10(4a) or 15(4a) of Regulation (EU) No 1095/1010. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making 27 . In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States' experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.  (101) To ensure consistent application of the relevant provisions under Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, the Commission should be empowered to adopt, in accordance with Article 290 TFEU and Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010, regulatory technical standards developed by ESMA related to the authorisation of regulated markets and PEMOs, and to the operation of trading venues. Furthermore, to ensure consistent harmonisation of standards, the Commission should be empowered to adopt, in accordance with Article 290 TFEU and with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council 28 and of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010, regulatory technical standards developed by the European Banking Authority ('EBA') and by the European Securities and Markets Authority ('ESMA') with regard to the procedures for the calculation of the criteria for establishing the significance of a CSD and the set of data EU CSDs are to report to ESMA for such calculation; the measures to be put in place by CSDs and market participants to prevent settlement fails and to increase the settlement efficiency of Union capital markets; the conditions under which an outsourcing arrangement is to be considered as the outsourcing of core CSD services; the measures to be implemented by CSDs to mitigate the specific risks stemming from the provision of CSD services using DLT; and the risk management measures and prudential requirements with respect to the settlement in commercial bank money and in e-money tokens. In addition, in order to ensure consistent harmonisation in the fees to be charged by ESMA to UCITS and AIFMs in connection with the passporting procedure and the maintenance of the data platform, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of measures to specify the type, amount, frequency and the modalities governing the payment of those fees. Furthermore, in order to ensure consistent harmonisation in the marketing communications made available to investors, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the TFEU should be delegated to the Commission to specify the content and format of marketing communications. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making. In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States' experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts. Lastly, to identify the requirements of Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 that should apply to the providers of the DLT notary and DLT central account maintenance service, and adapt them to the use of distributed ledger technology and the specificities of business models involving DLT notaries and DLT account keepers, ESMA should develop draft regulatory technical standards to supplement the provisions of Title III of Regulation (EU) No 909/2014.  (102) In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of Regulation (EU) No 909/2014, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to adopt implementing technical standards developed by ESMA with regard to the standard forms, templates and procedures for the disclosure of fees and prices by CSDs and by settlement internalisers. Those powers should be exercised in in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.  (103) Regulations (EU) No 1095/2010, No 648/2012, No 600/2014, No 909/2014, 2015/2365, 2019/1156, 202 1/23, 2022/858 , 2023/1114 , No 1060/2009, 2016/1011, 2017/2402, 2023/2631 and 2024/3005 should therefore be amended accordingly.  (104) It is necessary to provide ESMA with sufficient time to prepare for its new supervisory role, which entails changes to its governance. The amendments to Regulations (EU) 1095/2010, 2015/2365, 2019/1156, 2021/23,  2022/858, 2023/1114, (EU) No 1060/2009, 2016/1011, 2017/2402, 2023/2631, 2024/3005 should therefore start to apply from 12 months after the entry into force of this Regulation. However, to enable the Executive Board to be operational and to effectively take over the tasks assigned to it, the selection and appointment procedure for the members of the Executive Board should start to apply as from the date of entry into force of this Regulation .  (105) To ensure consistency with the amendments to Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010, the amendments to Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 should apply 12 months after the entry into force of this Regulation. However, to enable ESMA to start assessing whether a CCP is a significant CCP before the obligations on significant CCPs start to apply, the provisions that relate to that assessment should start to apply from the date of entry into force of this Regulation. To allow ESMA to gradually phase in the new supervisory responsibilities and to establish the necessary capacity and frameworks of cooperation, the amendments to Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 that relate to the supervision of significant CSDs should apply 24 months after the entry into force of this Regulation. However, to enable ESMA to start assessing whether a CSD is a significant CSD before the obligations on significant CSDs start to apply, the provisions that relate to that assessment should apply from the date of entry into force of this Regulation.  (106) To ensure legal certainty and to avoid disruptions to the establishment of the consolidated tape for shares and ETFs by the first CTP authorised in accordance with Article 27db of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, the amendments to that Regulation that relate to the consolidated tape for shares and ETFs should apply from [ OP insert date =  the day following the expiry of the first period of 5 years referred to in Article 27da of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 with respect to the CTP for shares and ETFs ]. To ensure consistency with the amendments to Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010, the amendments to Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 that relate to ESMA’s powers should start to apply 12 months after the entry into force of this Regulation. To allow for sufficient time to prepare the transfer from national competent authorities to ESMA of competences and duties with respect to the relevant trading venues, ESMA should become the competent authority for the entities concerned 24 months after the entry into force of this Regulation.  (107) The Regulation introduces binding requirements for cross-border digital public services within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2024/903. An interoperability assessment has therefore been completed. The Digital Dimensions chapter of the Legislative Financial and Digital Statement constitutes the resulting report. This will also be published on the Interoperable Europe Portal following the Act's adoption.  (108) The European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with Article 42(1) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council 29 and delivered an opinion on [ XX ].

Any system that falls within the definition of regulated market shall obtain an authorisation before commencing its activities from the competent authority of the Member State where it is situated or operated, or ESMA in the cases referred to in Article 38fa.  2. A regulated market shall be authorised by the competent authority where:  (a) both the market operator and the regulated market that the market operator intends to operate comply with the requirements laid down in this Chapter ;  (b) the market operator is a legal person established in the Union.  3. The market operator shall perform tasks relating to the organisation and operation of the regulated market under the supervision of the competent authority of the Member State where the regulated market is situated or operated, or ESMA in the cases referred to in Article 38fa, and, where expressly provided for by this Regulation, of the national surveillance authority. The market operator may perform ancillary activities that are linked to the operation of a regulated market.  Member States shall not impose any additional requirements on the authorisation and operation of regulated markets than those set out in this Regulation.  4. The market operator shall be responsible for ensuring that it and the regulated market that it operates comply at all times with the requirements laid down in this Regulation.  5. The market operator shall be entitled to exercise the rights that correspond to the regulated market that it operates by virtue of this Regulation.  6. A market operator shall, without undue delay, inform the competent authority of any substantive changes affecting the compliance with the conditions for authorisation laid down in this Chapter.  7. Without prejudice to any relevant provisions of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 or of Directive 2014/57/EU, the public law governing the trading conducted under the systems of the regulated market shall be that of the Member State where the regulated market is situated or operated.  Article 2b Procedures for granting and refusing applications for authorisation of regulated markets  1. The applicant market operator shall submit an application providing all information necessary to enable the competent authority to confirm that the market operator has put in place, at the time of initial authorisation of the regulated market, all the necessary arrangements to ensure that both the market operator and the systems of the regulated market that the market operator intends to operate meet the requirements laid down in this Chapter, including a programme of operations setting out, inter alia, the types of services envisaged and the organisational structure.  2. The competent authority shall assess whether the application for authorisation is complete within 20 working days of receipt of the application.  Where the application is not complete, the competent authority shall inform in writing the applicant of the additional information to be provided and set a deadline by which the market operator is to provide additional information.  After assessing the application as complete, the competent authority shall notify the market operator accordingly.  3. The competent authority shall, within six months of receipt of a complete application, assess the compliance with this Chapter of the market operator and of the systems of the regulated market that the market operator intends to operate. It shall adopt a reasoned decision granting or refusing authorisation and shall notify the applicant market operator accordingly within five working days of adoption. It shall also notify the national surveillance authority.  Article 2c Withdrawal of authorisation  1. The competent authority may withdraw the authorisation issued to a regulated market, where it:  (a) does not make use of the authorisation within 12 months, expressly renounces the authorisation or has not operated for the preceding six months;  (a) has obtained the authorisation by making false statements or by any other irregular means;  (b) no longer meets the conditions under which authorisation was granted;  (c) has seriously and systematically infringed this Regulation.  2. Where ESMA is the competent authority, it shall, without undue delay, notify the national surveillance authority of a decision to withdraw the authorisation of a regulated market.  Article 2d Requirements for the management body of a market operator  1. All members of the management body of a market operator shall at all times be of sufficiently good repute, possess sufficient knowledge, skills and experience to perform their duties. The overall composition of the management body shall reflect an adequately broad range of experience.  2. Members of the management body shall fulfil the following requirements:  (a) all members of the management body shall commit sufficient time to perform their functions in the market operator. The number of directorships a member of the management body can hold, in any legal entity, at the same time shall take into account individual circumstances and the nature, scale and complexity of the market operator’s activities.  Unless representing the Member State in which the market operator is established, members of the management body of market operators that are significant in terms of their size, internal organisation and the nature, the scope and the complexity of their activities shall not at the same time hold positions exceeding more than one of the following combinations:  (i) one executive directorship with two non-executive directorships;  (ii) four non-executive directorships.  Executive or non-executive directorships held within the same group or undertakings where the market operator owns a qualifying holding shall be considered to be one single directorship.  The competent authority may authorise members of the management body to hold one additional non-executive directorship. Where ESMA is not the competent authority, competent authorities shall regularly inform ESMA of such authorisations.  Directorships in organisations which do not pursue predominantly commercial objectives shall be exempt from the limitation on the number of directorships a member of a management body can hold.  (b) The management body shall possess adequate collective knowledge, skills and experience to be able to understand the market operator’s activities, including the main risks.  (c) Each member of the management body shall act with honesty, integrity and independence of mind to effectively assess and challenge the decisions of the senior management where necessary and to effectively oversee and monitor decision-making.  3. Market operators shall devote adequate human and financial resources to the induction and training of members of the management body.  4. Where, under national law, the management body has competence in the process of selection and appointment of any of its members, the competent authority shall assess whether, taking into account the size and the internal organisation of the market operator, as well as the nature, scope and complexity of its activities, the market operator shall establish a nomination committee composed of members of the management body who do not perform any executive function in the market operator concerned.  Where established, the nomination committee shall carry out the following:  (a) identify and recommend, for the approval of the management body or for approval of the general meeting, candidates to fill management body vacancies. In doing so, the nomination committee shall evaluate the balance of knowledge, skills, diversity and experience of the management body. Further, the committee shall prepare a description of the roles and capabilities for a particular appointment, and assess the time commitment expected. Furthermore, the nomination committee shall decide on a target for the representation of the underrepresented gender in the management body and prepare a policy on how to increase the number of the underrepresented gender in the management body in order to meet that target;  (b) periodically, and at least annually, assess the structure, size, composition and performance of the management body, and make recommendations to the management body with regard to any changes;  (c) periodically, and at least annually, assess the knowledge, skills and experience of individual members of the management body and of the management body collectively, and report to the management body accordingly;  (d) periodically review the policy of the management body for selection and appointment of senior management and make recommendations to the management body.  In performing its duties, the nomination committee shall, to the extent possible and on an ongoing basis, take account of the need to ensure that the management body’s decision making is not dominated by any one individual or small group of individuals in a manner that is detrimental to the interests of the market operator as a whole.  In performing its duties, the nomination committee shall be able to use any forms of resources it deems appropriate, including external advice.  5. Market operators and their respective nomination committees shall engage a broad set of qualities and competences when recruiting members to the management body and, for that purpose, shall put in place a policy promoting diversity on the management body.  6. The management body of a market operator shall define and oversee the implementation of the governance arrangements that ensure effective and prudent management of an organisation, including the segregation of duties in the organisation and the prevention of conflicts of interest, and in a manner that promotes the integrity of the market.  The management body shall monitor and periodically assess the effectiveness of the market operator’s governance arrangements and take appropriate steps to address any deficiencies.  Members of the management body shall have adequate access to information and documents which are needed to oversee and monitor management decision-making.  7. The competent authority shall refuse authorisation where it is not satisfied that the members of the management body of the market operator are of sufficiently good repute, possess sufficient knowledge, skills and experience and commit sufficient time to perform their functions, or where there are objective and demonstrable grounds for believing that the management body of the market operator may pose a threat to its effective, sound and prudent management and to the adequate consideration of the integrity of the market.  In the process of authorisation of a regulated market, the person or persons who effectively direct the business and the operations of another regulated market already authorised in the Union are deemed to comply with the requirements laid down in paragraph 1.  Where the conduct of a member of the management body of a market operator is likely to be prejudicial to its effective, sound and prudent management and to the adequate consideration of the integrity of the market, the competent authority shall take appropriate measures, which may include removing that member from the management body.  8. A market operator shall notify the competent authority of the names of all members of its management body and of any changes to its membership, along with all information needed to assess whether the market operator complies with paragraphs 1 to 6.  9. ESMA shall issue guidelines on the following:  (a) the notion of sufficient time commitment of a member of the management body to perform that member’s functions, in relation to the individual circumstances and the nature, scale and complexity of activities of the market operator;  (b) the notion of adequate collective knowledge, skills and experience of the management body as referred to in paragraph 2, point (b);  (c) the notions of honesty, integrity and independence of mind of a member of the management body as referred to in paragraph 2, point (c);  (d) the notion of adequate human and financial resources devoted to the induction and training of members of the management body as referred to in paragraph 3;  (e) the notion of diversity to be taken into account for the selection of members of the management body as referred to in paragraph 5.  Article 2e  Requirements relating to persons exercising significant influence over the management of the regulated market  1. The persons who are in a position to exercise, directly or indirectly, significant influence over the management of the regulated market shall be suitable.  2.  The market operator of the regulated market shall:  (a) provide the competent authority with, and make public, information regarding the ownership of market operator, and, where relevant, for regulated markets authorised pursuant to Directive 2014/65/EU as applicable before [OP: please insert date of entry into application of this Regulation], the ownership of the regulated market , and in particular, the identity and scale of interests of any parties in a position to exercise significant influence over the management;  (b) inform the competent authority of and make public any transfer of ownership which gives rise to a change in the identity of the persons exercising significant influence over the operation of the regulated market.  3. The competent authority shall refuse to approve proposed changes to the controlling interests of the market operator and, where relevant, of the regulated market, where there are objective and demonstrable grounds for believing that they would pose a threat to the sound and prudent management of the regulated market.  If changes to the controlling interests of the market operator and, where relevant, of the regulated market, take place despite the opposition of the competent authority, that competent authority shall be able to order the annulment of the corresponding votes cast.  4. Where the persons referred to in paragraph 1 exercise an influence which is likely to be prejudicial to the sound and prudent management of a regulated market, the competent authority shall take appropriate measures to put an end to that situation. Such measures may include applications for judicial orders, the imposition of sanctions against directors and those responsible for management, and the suspension of the exercise of the voting rights attached to the shares held by the shareholders or members in question.  5. Member States shall not impose any additional requirements for transfers of ownership which give rise to changes to the controlling interests of the market operator and, where relevant, of the regulated market.  Article 2 f Organisational requirements  1. Market operators shall ensure that a regulated market that they operate:  (a) has arrangements to identify clearly and manage the potential adverse consequences, for the operation of the regulated market or for its members or participants, of any conflict of interest between the interest of the regulated market, the market operator and its owners, and the sound functioning of the regulated market, and in particular where such conflicts of interest might prove prejudicial to the accomplishment of any functions delegated to the regulated market by the competent authority;  (b) is adequately equipped to manage the risks to which it is exposed, including to manage ICT risk in accordance with Chapter II of Regulation (EU) 2022/2554, to implement appropriate arrangements and systems for identifying significant risks to its operation, and to put in place effective measures to mitigate those risks;  (c) has transparent and non-discretionary rules and procedures that provide for fair and orderly trading and establish objective criteria for the efficient execution of orders;  (d) has effective arrangements to facilitate the efficient and timely finalisation of the transactions executed under its systems;  (e) has available, at the time of authorisation and on an ongoing basis, sufficient financial resources to facilitate its orderly functioning, having regard to the nature and extent of the transactions concluded on the market and the range and degree of the risks to which it is exposed;  (f) has arrangements in place to ensure that it meets data quality standards pursuant to Article 22b;  (g) has at least three materially active members or users, each having the opportunity to interact with all the others in respect of price formation.  Where, for the purposes of compliance with the requirements under the first subparagraph, points (a), (b), (d), and (f), a market operator deploys resources of or relies on the performance of functions by another entity located in the Union that belongs to the same group as that market operator, reliance on that entity shall not constitute outsourcing for the purposes of this Regulation, provided that the conditions set out in paragraph 1a are met. The location within the Union of the entity that deploys resources or performs functions for the compliance by a market operator with the requirements referred to in the first subparagraph, points (a), (b), (d), and (f), shall not be relevant in the assessment of that compliance by the competent authority.  1a. The reliance of a market operator on another entity located in the Union and that belongs to the same group as that market operator shall not constitute outsourcing pursuant to paragraph 1, provided that the following conditions are fulfilled:  (a) the market operator and another entity in the group that will deploy its resources or will perform functions for that regulated market have put in place arrangements to ensure that that entity within the same group cooperates with the competent authority and, where relevant, the national surveillance authority of the regulated market in connection with that deployment of resources or with that performance of functions;  (b) the market operator has put in place adequate mechanisms to identify clearly and manage the potential adverse consequences, for the operation of the regulated market or for its members or participants, of any conflict of interest between the regulated market, the market operator and another entity in the group that will deploy its resources or will perform functions for that regulated market.  When deploying resources of or relying on the performance of functions by another entity within the same group, market operators shall remain fully responsible for discharging all of their obligations under this Regulation and under Directive 2014/65/EU.

The market operator of the regulated market shall monitor and enforce compliance by investment firms with the requirements of such binding written agreements. The market operator of the regulated market shall inform the competent authority about the content of the binding written agreement and shall, upon request, provide all further information to the competent authority necessary to enable the competent authority to satisfy itself of compliance by the regulated market with this paragraph. Where ESMA is the competent authority, the national surveillance authority may request ESMA to share the content of the binding written agreements relevant to the supervisory activity of that national surveillance authority.  4.

Where the competent authority is not ESMA, the competent authority shall report those parameters to ESMA. Where a regulated market which is material in terms of liquidity in that financial instrument halts trading, in any Member State, the market operator of that regulated market shall ensure that the regulated market has the necessary systems and procedures in place to notify its competent authority, its national surveillance authority and ESMA, where ESMA is not its competent authority. The competent authority and, where ESMA is the competent authority, the national surveillance authority shall then notify all other competent authorities and, where relevant, national surveillance authorities in the Union in order for them to coordinate a market-wide response and determine whether it is appropriate to halt trading on other venues on which the financial instrument is traded until trading resumes on the original market.  The market operator of a regulated market shall ensure that the regulated market discloses publicly on its website information about the circumstances leading to the halting or constraining of trading and on the principles for establishing the main technical parameters used to do so.  Where a regulated market does not halt or constrain trading as referred to in the first subparagraph, despite the fact that a significant price movement in a financial instrument or related financial instruments has led to disorderly trading conditions on one or several markets, the competent authority or, where ESMA is the competent authority, the national surveillance authority shall be able to take appropriate measures to re-establish the normal functioning of the markets, including using the supervisory powers referred to in Article 69(2), points (m) to (p) of Directive 2014/65/EU. The national surveillance authority shall notify ESMA of the measures taken without undue delay.  6. The market operator of a regulated market shall ensure that the regulated market has in place effective systems, procedures and arrangements, including requiring members or participants to carry out appropriate testing of algorithms and providing environments to facilitate such testing in accordance with the requirements laid down in Chapters II and IV of Regulation (EU) 2022/2554, to ensure that algorithmic trading systems cannot create or contribute to disorderly trading conditions on the market and to manage any disorderly trading conditions which do arise from such algorithmic trading systems, including systems to limit the ratio of unexecuted orders to transactions that may be entered into the system by a member or participant, to be able to slow down the flow of orders if there is a risk of its system capacity being reached and to limit and enforce the minimum tick size that may be executed on the market.  7. The market operator of a regulated market that permits direct electronic access shall ensure that the regulated market has in place effective systems procedures and arrangements to ensure that members or participants are only permitted to provide direct electronic access if they are investment firms authorised under Directive 2014/65/EU or credit institutions authorised under Directive 2013/36/EU, that appropriate criteria are set and applied regarding the suitability of persons to whom such access may be provided and that the member or participant retains responsibility for orders and trades executed using that service in relation to the requirements of this Regulation.  The market operator of a regulated market shall ensure that the regulated market sets appropriate standards regarding risk controls and thresholds on trading through such access and shall be able to distinguish and if necessary to stop orders or trading by a person using direct electronic access separately from other orders or trading by the member or participant.  The market operator of a regulated market shall ensure that the regulated market has arrangements in place to suspend or terminate the provision of direct electronic access by a member or participant to a client in the case of non-compliance with this paragraph.  8. The market operator of a regulated market shall ensure that the rules of the regulated market on co-location services are transparent, fair and non-discriminatory.  9. The market operator of a regulated market shall ensure that the regulated market has fee structures including execution fees, ancillary fees and any rebates that are transparent, fair and non-discriminatory and that they do not create incentives to place, modify or cancel orders or to execute transactions in a way which contributes to disorderly trading conditions or market abuse. In particular, the market operator of a regulated market shall ensure that the regulated market imposes market making obligations in individual shares or a suitable basket of shares in exchange for any rebates that are granted.  A regulated market may adjust its fees for cancelled orders according to the length of time for which the order was maintained and calibrate the fees to each financial instrument to which they apply.  A regulated market may impose a higher fee for placing an order that is subsequently cancelled than an order which is executed and impose a higher fee on participants placing a high ratio of cancelled orders to executed orders and on those operating a high-frequency algorithmic trading technique in order to reflect the additional burden on system capacity.  10. The market operator of a regulated market shall ensure that the regulated market be able to identify, by means of flagging from members or participants, orders generated by algorithmic trading, the different algorithms used for the creation of orders and the relevant persons initiating those orders. That information shall be available upon request to competent authorities and, where ESMA is the competent authority, to national surveillance authorities  The market operator of a regulated market shall ensure that the regulated market makes available to the competent authority or, where ESMA is the competent authority, to the national surveillance authority data relating to the order book or give the competent authority or, where relevant to the national surveillance authority access to the order book, upon request, so that it is able to monitor trading. The national surveillance authority shall, in turn, report that data to ESMA, upon request.  Article 2 h Tick sizes  1. The market operator of a regulated market shall ensure that the regulated market adopts tick‐size regimes in shares, depositary receipts, exchange‐traded funds, certificates and other similar financial instruments and in any other financial instrument for which regulatory technical standards are developed in accordance with Article 2zg(3), point (k). The application of tick sizes shall not prevent regulated markets from matching orders large in scale at mid‐point within the current bid and offer prices.  2. The tick size regimes referred to in paragraph 1 shall:  (a) be calibrated to reflect the liquidity profile of the financial instrument in different markets and the average bid-ask spread, taking into account the desirability of enabling reasonably stable prices without unduly constraining further narrowing of spreads;  (b) adapt the tick size for each financial instrument appropriately.  In respect of shares with an International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) issued outside the European Economic Area (EEA), or shares which have an EEA ISIN and which are traded on a third-country venue in the local currency or in a non-EEA currency, as referred to in Article 23(1), point (a), for which the venue that is the most relevant market in terms of liquidity is in a third country, regulated markets may provide for the same tick size that applies on that venue.  Article 2 i Admission of financial instruments to trading  1. The market operator of a regulated market shall ensure that the regulated market has clear and transparent rules regarding the admission of financial instruments to trading.  Those rules shall ensure that any financial instruments admitted to trading on a regulated market are capable of being traded in a fair, orderly and efficient manner and, in the case of transferable securities, are freely negotiable.  Member States shall not restrict the scope of financial instruments that can be admitted to trading on a regulated market on the ground that such instruments shall not be made available to non-professional investors in their jurisdiction.  2. In the case of derivatives, the rules referred to in paragraph 1 shall ensure in particular that the design of the derivative contract allows for its orderly pricing as well as for the existence of effective settlement conditions.  3. In addition to the obligations set out in paragraphs 1 and 2, the market operator of a regulated market shall ensure that the regulated market establishes and maintains effective arrangements to verify that issuers of transferable securities that are admitted to trading on the regulated market comply with their obligations under Union law in respect of initial, ongoing or ad hoc disclosure obligations.  The market operator of a regulated market shall ensure that the regulated market establishes arrangements which facilitate their members or participants in obtaining access to information which has been made public under Union law.  4. The market operator of a regulated market shall ensure that the regulated market establishes the necessary arrangements to review regularly the compliance with the admission requirements of the financial instruments which it admits to trading.  5. A transferable security that has been admitted to trading on a regulated market can subsequently be admitted to trading on other regulated markets, even without the consent of the issuer and in compliance with the relevant provisions of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129. The issuer shall be informed by the regulated market of the fact that its securities are traded on that regulated market. The issuer shall not be subject to any obligation to provide information required under paragraph 3 directly to any regulated market which has admitted the issuer’s securities to trading without its consent.  Article 2 j Specific conditions for the admission to trading of shares  1. The market operator of a regulated market shall ensure that the regulated market requires that the foreseeable market capitalisation of the company for whose shares admission to trading is sought, or if that cannot be assessed, that company’s capital and reserves, including profit and loss, from the last financial year, shall be at least EUR 1 000 000 or an equivalent amount in a national currency other than the euro.  2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply to the admission to trading of shares fungible with shares already admitted to trading.  3. Where, as a result of an adjustment of the equivalent amount in a national currency other than the euro, the market capitalisation expressed in the national currency remains for a period of one year at least 10 % more, or at least 10 % less, than EUR 1 000 000, the market operator shall, within the 12 months following the expiry of that period, ensure that the regulated market adjusts its rules to comply with paragraph 1.  4. The market operator of a regulated market shall ensure that the regulated market requires that at least 10 % of the subscribed capital represented by the class of shares concerned by the application for admission to trading is held by the public at the time of admission to trading.  5. By way of derogation from paragraph 4, Member States may require that regulated markets establish, at the time of admission, at least one of the following requirements for an application for admission to trading of shares:  (a) a sufficient number of shares is held by the public;  (b) the shares are held by a sufficient number of shareholders;  (c) the market value of the shares held by the public represents a sufficient level of subscribed capital in the class of shares concerned.  6. Where admission to trading is sought for shares fungible with shares already admitted to trading, regulated markets shall assess, to fulfil the requirement laid down in paragraph 4, whether a sufficient number of shares has been distributed to the public in relation to all shares issued and not only in relation to the shares fungible with shares already admitted to trading.  Article 2 k Suspension and removal of financial instruments from trading on a regulated market  1. Without prejudice to the right of the competent authority or, where ESMA is the competent authority, the national surveillance authority under Article 69(2) of Directive 2014/65/EU to demand suspension or removal of a financial instrument from trading, a market operator may suspend or remove from trading a financial instrument which no longer complies with the rules of the regulated market unless such suspension or removal would be likely to cause significant damage to the investors’ interests or the orderly functioning of the market.  2. A market operator that suspends or removes from trading a financial instrument shall also suspend or remove the derivatives as referred to in points (4) to (10) of Section C of Annex I to Directive 2014/65/EC that relate or are referenced to that financial instrument where necessary to support the objectives of the suspension or removal of the underlying financial instrument. The market operator shall make public the suspension or removal of the financial instrument and of any related derivative and communicate it to its competent authority and, where ESMA is the competent authority, its national surveillance authority.  Market operators operating other regulated markets, and market operators and investment firms operating MTFs, OTFs and systematic internalisers, which trade the same financial instrument as referred to in paragraph 1 or derivatives as referred to in points (4) to (10) of Section C of Annex I to Directive 2014/65/EC that relate or are referenced to the financial instrument referred to in paragraph 1, shall upon gaining knowledge of such suspension or removal and without undue delay also suspend or remove that financial instrument or derivatives from trading, where the suspension or removal is due to suspected market abuse, a take-over bid or the non-disclosure of inside information about the issuer or financial instrument infringing Articles 7 and 17 of Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014, unless the competent authority or, where ESMA is the competent authority, the national surveillance authority deems that the suspension or removal could cause significant damage to the investors’ interests or the orderly functioning of the market.  The market operators, investment firms and systematic internalisers referred to in the previous subparagraph shall make public the suspension or removal of the financial instrument and of any related derivative. This paragraph applies also when the suspension from trading of a financial instrument or derivatives as referred to in points (4) to (10) of Section C of Annex I to Directive 2014/65/EC that relate or are referenced to that financial instrument is lifted.  This paragraph shall also apply in the case where the decision to suspend or remove from trading a financial instrument or derivatives as referred to in points (4) to (10) of Section C of Annex I to Directive 2014/65/EC that relate or are referenced to that financial instrument is taken by the competent authority or, where ESMA is the competent authority, the national surveillance authority pursuant to Article 69(2), points (m) and (n), of Directive 2014/65/EU.  Article 2 l Access to a regulated market  1. The market operator of a regulated market shall ensure that the regulated market establishes, implements and maintains transparent and non-discriminatory rules, based on objective criteria, governing access to or membership of the regulated market.  2. The rules referred to in paragraph 1 shall specify any obligations for the members or participants arising from:  (a) the constitution and administration of the regulated market;  (b) rules relating to transactions on the market;  (c) professional standards imposed on the staff of the investment firms or credit institutions that are operating on the market;  (d) the conditions established, for members or participants other than investment firms and credit institutions, under paragraph 3 ;  (e) the rules and procedures for the clearing and settlement of transactions concluded on the regulated market.  3. Regulated markets may admit as members or participants investment firms, credit institutions authorised under Directive 2013/36/EU, and other persons who:  (a) are of sufficient good repute;  (b) have a sufficient level of trading ability, competence and experience;  (c) have, where applicable, adequate organisational arrangements;  (d) have sufficient resources for the role they are to perform, taking into account the different financial arrangements that the regulated market may have established in order to guarantee the adequate settlement of transactions.  3a. When admitting as members or participants persons that are already members or participants of another regulated market, regulated markets shall deem that those persons comply with paragraph 3, point (a), without any further assessment. Regulated markets shall also deem that those persons comply with paragraph 2, point (c), or paragraph 3, points (b) and (c), as applicable, without any further assessment, where they request to become members or participants with respect to trading in a class of financial instruments for which they are already members or participants of another regulated market.  4. For the transactions concluded on a regulated market, members and participants are not obliged to apply to each other the obligations laid down in Articles 24, 25, 27 and 28 of Directive 2014/65/EU. However, the members or participants of the regulated market shall apply the obligations provided for in Articles 24, 25, 27 and 28 of Directive 2014/65/EU with respect to their clients when they, acting on behalf of their clients, execute their orders on a regulated market.  5. The rules on access to or membership of or participation in a regulated market shall provide for the direct or remote participation of investment firms and credit institutions. Those rules shall not discriminate between direct or remote participation or impose any additional restrictions on either form of participation.  6. Market operators shall communicate, on a regular basis, to the competent authority and, where ESMA is the competent authority, to the national surveillance authority, the list of the members or participants of the regulated markets they operate.  Article 2 m Notification of amendments to the rules of the regulated market  1. A market operator shall notify the competent authority of any amendment to the rules of the regulated market it operates at least 30 days before that amendment takes effect.  2. The competent authority shall have the power to require a market operator to amend the rules of the regulated market it operates where it finds that those rules do not comply with the requirements under this Regulation.  Article 2 n Monitoring of compliance with the rules of the regulated market and with other legal obligations  1. The market operator of a regulated market shall ensure that the regulated market establishes and maintains effective arrangements and procedures including the necessary resources for the regular monitoring of the compliance by their members or participants with their rules. Regulated markets shall monitor orders sent including cancellations and the transactions undertaken by their members or participants under their systems in order to identify infringements of those rules, disorderly trading conditions or conduct that may indicate behaviour that is prohibited under Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 or system disruptions in relation to a financial instrument and shall deploy the resources necessary to ensure that such monitoring is effective.  2. The market operator of a regulated market shall immediately inform its competent authority and, where ESMA is the competent authority, the national surveillance authority, of significant infringements of their rules or disorderly trading conditions or conduct that may indicate behaviour that is prohibited under Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 or system disruptions in relation to a financial instrument.  The competent authority or, where ESMA is the competent authority, the national surveillance authority shall communicate the information referred to in the first subparagraph to ESMA and to the authorities designated in accordance with Article 67(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU of the other Member States.  In relation to conduct that may indicate behaviour that is prohibited under Regulation (EU) No 596/2014, the competent authority or, where ESMA is the competent authority, the national surveillance authority shall be convinced that such behaviour is being or has been carried out before it notifies the authorities designated in accordance with Article 67(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU of the other Member States.  Where ESMA is the competent authority, ESMA shall take due consideration of the information received pursuant to this paragraph, in particular when assessing a potential infringement of paragraph 1 by the regulated market. ESMA may require the national surveillance authority to submit any additional information necessary for the purpose of this assessment.  Where ESMA is the competent authority, in cases where a national surveillance authority considers that the information referred to in this paragraph has not been provided or has not been provided in a timely manner by the market operator, that authority shall inform ESMA. ESMA shall assess, within 20 working days, whether the market operator has breached its obligations under the first subparagraph, and take the appropriate measures.  3. The market operator shall supply the relevant information without undue delay to the authority competent for the investigation and prosecution of market abuse on the regulated market and provide full assistance to the latter in investigating and prosecuting market abuse occurring on or through the systems of the regulated market.  Where ESMA is the competent authority of the regulated market, in cases where an authority competent for the investigation and prosecution of market abuse on such a regulated market considers that the information or the assistance referred to in this paragraph has not been provided or has not been provided in a timely manner, that authority shall inform ESMA. ESMA shall assess, within 20 working days, whether the market operator has breached its obligations under the first subparagraph, and take the appropriate measures.  Article 2o Cross-border activity of regulated markets  1. An authorised regulated market may freely perform its activity within the Union, through the freedom to provide services or through setting up a branch. Those activities shall include at least:  (a) the provision of appropriate arrangements so as to facilitate access to and trading on that regulated market by remote members or participants established in any Member State;  (b) activities relating to the admission of members or participants on that regulated market;  (c) activities relating to the admission of financial instruments to trading on that regulated market.  2. The market operator of an authorised regulated market, or of a regulated market that has applied for authorisation pursuant to Article 2b that intends to perform its activity within the territory of another Member State, shall ensure that the regulated market communicates to its competent authority the Member State in which it intends to perform its activity. The competent authority shall communicate that information to the authority designated pursuant to Article 67 of Directive 2014/65/EU of the Member State where the regulated market intends to perform its activity, within seven working days. Where ESMA is not the competent authority, ESMA may request access to that information in accordance with the procedure and under the conditions set out in Article 35 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.  The competent authority of the regulated market shall, on the request of the authority designated pursuant to Article 67 of Directive 2014/65/EU of the Member State where the regulated market intends to perform or performs its activity, and, without undue delay, communicate the identity of the members or participants of the regulated market that are established in that Member State.  Where the regulated market sets up a branch, the information referred to in the first subparagraph shall include:  (a) the tasks that will be carried out by the branch;  (b) the organisational structure of the branch;  (c) the address in the Member State where the regulated market intends to set up a branch;  (d) the names of those responsible for the management of the branch.  3. In the event of a change in any of the particulars communicated in accordance with paragraph 2, the market operator of a regulated market shall ensure that the regulated market gives written notice of that change to its competent authority at least seven working days before implementing the change. That competent authority shall notify that change to the authority designated pursuant to Article 67 of Directive 2014/65/EU of the Member State where the regulated market performs its activity.  4. Member States shall not impose any further legal or administrative requirements in relation to the cross-border activity of regulated markets in their territory.  CHAPTER 2 Requirements for MTFs and OTFs  Article 2p Requirement for authorisation for MTFs and OTFs operated by a market operator  A competent authority shall authorise a market operator to operate an MTF or OTF subject to the prior verification of its compliance with the provisions set out in this Chapter.  Article 2q Authorisation, ongoing supervision and withdrawal of authorisation of investment firms to operate MTFs or OTFs  1. Where ESMA is the competent authority pursuant to Article 38fa for an investment firm or a market operator operating a significant trading venue, and where an applicant investment firm belongs to the same group as that investment firm or that market operator operating a significant trading venue, ESMA shall be empowered to authorise that applicant investment firm where it intends to exclusively perform the operation of an MTF or an OTF, or both.  2. ESMA shall keep under regular review the compliance of the investment firm authorised in accordance with paragraph 1 with the requirements set out in this Regulation and Title II of Directive 2014/65/EU.  3. ESMA may withdraw the authorisation issued to an investment firm in accordance with paragraph 1 where the conditions for withdrawal set out in Article 8 of Directive 2014/65/EU are met.  4. For the purposes of carrying out the tasks conferred on it by this Article, ESMA shall apply the national provisions transposing Directive 2014/65/EU of the home Member State of that investment firm, interpreted in a manner consistent with Union law.  5.

After assessing the application as complete, ESMA shall notify the investment firm accordingly.  ESMA shall, within 60 working days of receipt of the complete application, issue an opinion on the authorisation to operate an MTF or OTF and transmit that opinion without undue delay to the competent authority of the home Member State.  The competent authority of the home Member State shall adopt a reasoned decision granting or refusing the authorisation on the basis of the opinion transmitted by ESMA and shall notify the investment firm accordingly within five working days of adoption. The competent authority shall refuse the authorisation to operate an MTF or OTF where ESMA gives a negative opinion.  6. The competent authority of the home Member State may withdraw the authorisation referred to in the previous paragraph, where ESMA notifies it that any of the conditions set out in Article 8 of Directive 2014/65/EU is met in relation to the operation of an MTF or an OTF. Where the competent authority withdraws the authorisation, it shall inform the investment firm accordingly.  7.

Where the request referred to in paragraph 1 concerns investment services or activities other than the operation of an MTF or an OTF, ESMA shall without undue delay transmit that request and any information provided by the investment firm for that purpose to the competent authority of the home Member State of the investment firm.  The competent authority referred to in subparagraph 1 shall assess whether the application for authorisation is complete within 10 working days of receipt of the application.  Where the application is not complete, the competent authority shall set a deadline by which the investment firm is to provide additional information.

ESMA shall refuse the extension of the authorisation where the competent authority gives a negative opinion.  3. Without prejudice to Article 2q(3), ESMA shall withdraw the authorisation referred to in Article 2q in relation to services or activities referred to in paragraph 1, where the competent authority of the home Member State of the investment firm provides a reasoned opinion concluding that any of the conditions set out in Article 8 of Directive 2014/65/EU is met in relation to the investment services or activities referred to in paragraph 1. Where ESMA withdraws the authorisation, it shall inform the investment firm accordingly.  4.

Paragraphs 1 to 3 shall apply as of when ESMA becomes the competent authority pursuant to Article 38fa.  Article 2u C ompliance with the rules of the MTF or the OTF and with other legal obligations  1.

The supervisory transition plan shall include all transitional arrangements necessary for the smooth and orderly transfer of competences and duties between ESMA and national surveillance authorities as well as an effective date, by which the transfer of such competences and duties shall apply.

FRAMEWORK OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE  1.1. Title of the proposal/initiative  This legislative financial and digital statement covers the following proposals:  - proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulations (EU) 1095/2010, 648/2012, 600/2014, 909/2014, 2019/1156, 2022/858 and 2023/1114 as regards the further development of market integration and supervision within the Union (‘Master Regulation’)  - proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directives (EU) 2009/65/EC, 2011/61/EU and 2014/65/EU as regards the further development of market integration and supervision within the Union (‘Master Directive’)  1.2. Policy area(s) concerned  Internal market – financial services  1.3. Objective(s)  1.3.1. General objective(s)  The general objectives of the initiative are to improve the functioning of the single market in financial services by addressing persistent fragmentation both within and across relevant sectors (trading, post trading, asset management and crypto asset services). The proposed changes aim to foster stronger market integration and enable efficiency gains by removing obstacles to cross-border activity and strengthening regulatory and supervisory convergence as well as supervisory capacity in the relevant sectors.  This package of measures addresses two core pillars of the Commission’s Savings and Investment Union (SIU) strategy: ‘integration and scale’, and ‘efficient supervision in the single market’. It has a very broad scope and encompasses key sectors that form the backbone of capital markets, providing essential infrastructure for offering and investing in financial instruments and assets, and enabling crucial intermediation between investors and entities seeking financing.  1.3.2. Specific objective(s)  The specific objectives of this initiative are as follows:  • Enable further market integration and scale effects by increasing cross-border activity – the initiative aims to improve the ability of market actors to operate seamlessly across Member States, thereby increasing market integration. This in turn should drive both consolidation and specialisation within the individual sectors.  • Improve supervision by reducing fragmentation – the initiative seeks to address shortcomings and inefficiencies in the current supervisory framework, by tackling inconsistencies and complexities arising from fragmented national supervisory approaches. It aims to make supervision more effective, more conducive to cross-border activities, and more responsive to emerging risks, while reducing unnecessary burdens on firms. This should also increase investor confidence. Strengthening supervisory powers and capacities at the EU level, including by transferring more direct supervisory responsibilities to ESMA, aims to leverage the mutually reinforcing relationship between market integration and supervisory alignment.  • Facilitate innovation by removing regulatory obstacles – the initiative aims to remove regulatory obstacles to innovation with the aim of creating a framework which enables new technologies in the provision of financial services. For innovation to thrive, both the DLT Pilot Regime (DLTPR) and the standard rulebook should allow the industry to use distributed ledger technology (DLT) to bring efficient solutions to the market while ensuring that associated risks are mitigated.  The specific objectives will be pursued without compromising financial stability, market integrity or investor protection, thereby ensuring that the EU financial market remains safe and globally attractive.  1.3.3. Expected result(s) and impact  Specify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.  This initiative affects in particular the following groups of stakeholders: trading venues, investment firms (notably brokers), central securities depositories (CSDs), central counterparties (CCPs), asset managers, crypto asset service providers (CASPs), DLT-based structures, investors (including retail end-investors), national competent authorities (NCAs), the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the European Central Bank (ECB).  In terms of benefits, trading venues and investment firms would benefit from rationalisation of intra-group operations, cross-border operations and savings linked to local governance costs. Operational efficiency gains for exchange operators should be partially passed on to downstream intermediaries and retail and institutional investors. CSDs would benefit from facilitation of cross-border provision of services and from increased legal clarity and certainty. Moreover, costs per settlement transaction could be reduced by a greater use of TARGET2-Securities (T2S). CSDs, investment firms, CASPS, credit institutions using DLT-based structures would also benefit from harmonised definitions and concepts. Asset managers would benefit from reduced compliance burden and legal costs as well as increased legal clarity when engaging in cross-border activities.  Financial market participants under strengthened EU supervision (i.e. cross-border significant trading venues, CSDs, CCPs, asset management firms and CASPs) would benefit from: 1) reduced compliance cost and administrative burden for entities currently supervised by multiple NCAs; 2) savings stemming from fewer duplications, differences in instructions and procedural delays; 3) reduction of supervisory fees for entities currently supervised by several NCAs and 4) savings due to synergies and increased intra-group outsourcing/delegation.  The initiative is expected to lead to deeper and more integrated financial markets and increased trust in financial markets, benefitting end-users and the wider economy. Institutional and retail investors are expected to face lower trading costs and a larger choice of financial products and services. More agile and comprehensive supervision of capital markets will increase investors’ trust and overall confidence in the governance and supervision of capital markets. This could increase cross-border investments in the single market, yielding benefits for companies via a broader access to funding and expected lower financing costs.  On the cost side, trading venues, brokers, CSDs, asset managers, CASPs and DLT-based structures would face implementation costs to align their operations with legal changes. For instance, CSDs would have to invest in establishing new links with other CSDs, if not yet in place, and to join T2S, if they are not members already. The ECB would likely have to invest into T2S to accommodate a higher number of linked CSDs as well as higher securities settlement volumes, in addition to any other changes to the functionality of the platform. ESMA would have to hire additional staff to perform new tasks (financed through fees) while NCAs would gain room for staff reductions due to centralisation of certain tasks.  1.3.4. Indicators of performance  Specify the indicators for monitoring progress and achievements.  Non-exhaustive list of potential indicators:  Number of Pan-European market operators  Average number of broker-venue connections  Number of instances of a regulated market setting up a branch in another Member State  Number of trading venues that are part of a group that are able to rely on staff/resources of other entities part of the same group which are based in the Union  Number of brokers offering cross-border trading  Average gap in fees charged between domestic and cross-border trading within the EU  Volume of cross-border transactions in the EU  Average transaction costs (per asset class; domestic/cross-border)  Number of open access arrangements / applications under open access provisions  Total cross-border settlement activity (volume/value by instrument)  Total cross-border issuance (value/volume)  Number and types of instances of cross-border provision of services by regulated markets  Number and types of instances of cross-border provision of services by CSDs  Number of instances of a CSD setting up a branch in another Member State  Number of CSDs that are part of a group that engage in intra-group outsourcing of core CSD activities  Number of CSDs experimenting with new technologies  Volume and value of settlement conducted by settlement internalisers  Number of CSDs that designate credit institutions to provide banking-type ancillary services  Volume and value of settlement activity taking place in T2S  Total number of CSD links  Settlement activity (in volume and value terms) executed using novel technologies (increase)  Total amount of cash leg settlement executed with digital forms of money  Number of cross-border funds (marketed cross-border)  Average size of funds  Average management cost of funds (per sector / specialisation)  Creation/cessation of funds (indication of market entry barriers)  Number and average size of asset managers  Number of asset manager groups and number of Member States where they operate  Number of DLT-based authorisations  Number of Member States with legal frameworks to allow DLT-based transfer of ownership  Number of colleges with ESMA participation  Number of joint on-site inspections  Number of peer reviews conducted  Number of obstacles to convergence identified and removed  Number of collaboration platforms  Number of investigations of breach of EU law successfully closed  Number of warnings on manifest breach of the EU law  Number of on-site inspections and dedicated investigations  1.4. The proposal/initiative relates to:   a new action   a new action following a pilot project / preparatory action 44   the extension of an existing action   a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action  1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative  1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative  The initiative is expected to follow a phased implementation. In the short term (within 2 years after adoption), preparatory actions would include the development of secondary legislation, establishment of technical standards, and (within 1 year after the adoption) preparatory measures for supervisory transitions. Two years after the adoption new supervisory structures and processes would become operational, allowing ESMA to assume its expanded responsibilities. Two years after entry into force, new supervisory structures and processes would become operational, allowing ESMA to assume its expanded responsibilities.  1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, great er effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this section 'added value of EU involvement' is the value resulting from EU action, that is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.  Reasons for action at EU level (ex-ante)  The cross-border nature of activities in scope of this initiative and the systemic implications of the related supervisory decisions go beyond the capacity of any single Member States to address identified barriers effectively. Action at EU level is justified as it aims at reducing legal and operational uncertainties for businesses and investors, encouraging cross-border investments, enhancing market efficiency, consistency and coherence across all Member States. It is also justified to ensure consistent supervision, safeguard financial stability, and preserve the integrity of the internal market. Moreover, such EU-level initiatives promote a level playing field and increase the attractiveness and competitiveness of the single market for financial services and their economic efficiency, which can only be achieved through coordinated efforts at EU level. The initiative remains proportionate as it ensures the balance between EU and national competence, with respect to entities and activities with material cross-border relevance and those of primarily domestic importance.  Expected generated EU added value (ex-post)  The initiative would create clear EU-wide benefits by removing barriers to cross-border activity, reducing duplication and compliance costs, and enhancing supervisory consistency. It would enable more integrated and efficient financial markets, lowering operational and governance costs for trading venues, CSDs, asset managers and crypto-asset service providers, while providing end-investors with greater trust, lower trading costs and a wider choice of products. Stronger and more coherent EU-level supervision would reduce fragmentation, improve legal certainty and promote cross-border investment, ultimately supporting companies’ access to finance and the competitiveness of EU capital markets.  1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past  The impact assessment accompanying the legislative proposal has assessed how the existing frameworks have performed and identified a number of shortcomings, in particular with respect to (i) barriers to cross-border operations and innovation, and (ii) non-aligned supervisory practices across Member States and weak tools and powers at EU level to enforce convergence and adopt a comprehensive single market/cross-border supervisory approach.  1.5.4. Compatibility with the multiannual financial framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments  The initiative will require additional resources and infrastructure at ESMA to support expanded direct supervision and coordination roles. Staffing needs are explained in the Appendix.  1.5.5. Assessment of the different available financing options, including scope for redeployment  Additional tasks conferred by the legislators could not be covered by redeployment.  The proposal requires a range of new activities and tasks, for which a high proportion of expenses, including overhead and IT systems, will be funded via fees levied on financial market participants supervised by ESMA. An exception to this is that in the preparatory phase, the EU would entirely finance ESMA for the set-up of its operations, so as to enable it to build the function during this key early phase, where fees cannot – yet – be levied whereas costs are incurred. Concerning IT development costs related to fee-funded activities, these would initially be paid from the EU budget but then recovered over a five-year period via fees. It is anticipated that preparation for supervision will take place from mid-2028 to mid-2029 and IT development costs are spread between 2028/2029 and 2030/31.  Not all new tasks are suitable for fee-based financing. Activities relating to supervisory convergence in the areas where ESMA doesn’t have direct supervisory mandates IT tools for the areas where ESMA doesn’t have direct supervisory mandates and DLT will instead be co-funded by the EU and national competent authorities (NCAs), reflecting their broader, system-wide objectives. Since these functions are designed to promote consistency and cooperation across the supervisory network, they cannot appropriately be financed through fees imposed directly on entities overseen by NCAs.  1.6.

Comments  The initiative requires additional resources both under direct management within Commission departments dealing with financial services, and under indirect management within the ESMA agency.  2. MANAGEMENT MEASURES  2.1. Monitoring and reporting rules  As a decentralised agency, ESMA is subject to the legal and operational requirements of the Union laws in terms of monitoring and reporting rules. In line with already existing arrangements, ESMA prepares regular reports on its activity (including internal reporting to Senior Management, reporting to Boards and the production of the annual report), and is subject to audits by the European Court of Auditors and its own Internal Auditor (the Internal Audit Service of the Commission) on its use of resources and performance. Monitoring and reporting of the actions included in the proposal will comply with the already existing requirements, as well as with any new requirements resulting from this proposal.  2.2. Management and control system(s)  2.2.1. Justification of the budget implementation method(s), the funding implementation mechanism(s), the payment modalities and the control strategy proposed  The tasks will be implemented essentially by ESMA under indirect management, with funding covered by the EU budget co-financed in part via NCAs’ contributions, and by fees levied on supervised entities.  In accordance with Article 30 of its Financial Regulations, ESMA is to implement its budgets in compliance with effective and efficient internal control, which should be based upon best international practices and on the Internal Control Framework laid down by the Commission for its own departments.  In accordance with Article 2 of ESMA’s Financial Regulation, the Executive Director of ESMA is the authorising officer who in accordance with Article 45(1) of that Financial Regulation is ‘ responsible for implementing revenue and expenditure in accordance with the principle of sound financial management, including through ensuring reporting on performance and for ensuring compliance with the requirements of legality and regularity and equal treatment of recipients of Union funds. ’ As specified in Article 45(2) of ESMA’s Financial Regulation it is the duty of the authorising officer to put in place the organisational structure and the internal control systems suited to the performance of their duties.  In accordance with Article 70(5) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 of the European Parliament and of the Council (the Financial Regulation), the Internal Auditor of the Commission is also the Internal Auditor of ESMA. In particular, in accordance with Article 78(3) of the Financial Regulations of ESMA, the Commission’s Internal Auditor (i.e. the Internal Audit Service) is responsible for:  (a) assessing the suitability and effectiveness of internal management systems and the performance of departments in implementing programmes and actions by reference to the risks associated with them;  (b) assessing the efficiency and effectiveness of the internal control and audit systems applicable to each operation for implementation of the budget of the Union body.  These responsibilities of the Internal Audit Service will also extend to the tasks implemented by ESMA in accordance with the proposed legislation.  As well as the work of the Internal Audit Service, ESMA is subject to external audit including by the European Court of Auditors, which in accordance with Article 104 of the Financial Regulations of ESMA, shall each year prepare specific annual reports on ESMA in line with the requirements of Article 287(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  2.2.2. Information concerning the risks identified and the internal control system(s) set up to mitigate them  In accordance with Article 45(2) of ESMA’s Financial Regulation, ESMA’s Executive Director, in their role as ESMA’s authorising officer, is to pay due regard to the risks associated with the management environment and the specific risks associated with the nature of the actions financed when putting in place the internal control systems suited to the performance of the duties of the authorising officer. As indicated in the second sub-paragraph of Article 45(2) of ESMA’s Financial Regulation ‘ The establishment of such structure and systems shall be supported by a comprehensive risk analysis, which takes into account their cost-effectiveness and performance considerations. ’  ESMA closely co-operated with its internal auditor (which is the Internal Audit Service of the Commission) to ensure that the appropriate standards are observed in all areas of the internal control framework. Every year, the European Parliament, following a recommendation from the Council, grants discharge to ESMA for the implementation of its budget. This initiative does not bring about new significant risks that would not be covered by an existing internal control framework.  2.2.3. Estimation and justification of the cost-effectiveness of the controls (ratio between the control costs and the value of the related funds managed), and assessment of the expected levels of risk of error (at payment & at closure)  Internal control systems as provided for in ESMA’s Financial Regulation are already implemented and have not been found by ESMA’s internal auditor not to be cost effective. On the basis of past findings of the European Court of Auditors, the risk of errors is expected to be low.  Historically costs incurred by the Commission for the overall cooperation have been estimated at 0.5% of the annual contributions paid to them. Such costs include, for example but not exclusively, the costs related to the assessment of the annual programming and budget, the participation of DG FISMA's representatives in Management Boards, Boards of Supervisors, internal committees and related preparatory work. The initiative is expected to create additional work for the Commission.  2.3. Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities  For the purpose of combating fraud, corruption and any other illegal activity, the provisions of Regulation (EU, Euratom) N°883/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 September 2013 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) apply to the ESAs without any restriction. The ESMA has a dedicated anti-fraud strategy and resulting action plan. ESMA's actions in the area of anti-fraud should be compliant with its Financial Regulation, OLAF’s fraud prevention policies, the provisions provided by the Commission Anti-Fraud Strategy (COM(2019)196) as well as the Common Approach on EU decentralised agencies (July 2012) and the related roadmap. In addition, the Regulations establishing ESMA as well as the ESMA's Financial Regulations set out the provisions on implementation and control of the ESAs' budgets and applicable financial rules, including those aimed at preventing fraud and irregularities.  3.

They support the creation of data flows between financial market business operators, Member States Competent Authorities and EU institutions. The requirements also promote horizontal data sharing across public administrations, which is a key focus of the European data strategy.  Alignment with the once-only principle  Explanation of how the once-only principle has been considered and how the possibility to reuse existing data has been explored  Table: Row 1 — The initiative promotes a ""collect only once, share many times"" approach, where data is gathered only once and then made available to relevant authorities in Member States and EU institutions. This therefore ensures that the initiator only submits information once and that there is no duplication. The initiative promotes alignment and centralised procedures for the same cross-border services. Amendments to Regulation (EU) 600/2014 (MiFIR) For Article 22b, the quotes generated by systematic internalisers would be submitted once on an ongoing basis, with this information being reused or accessed by users of the consolidates or for regulatory purposes. For Article 25, details of orders in financial instruments are already kept at the disposal of national competent authorities (or future national surveillance authorities). The new requirement will provide ESMA with a possibility to request from national surveillance authorities the already-collected data without creating a new reporting obligation for market participants. For Article 38fd, the data would be submitted once by the applicant (e.g. a trading venue) seeking authorisation from ESMA. That information could then be accessed by the applicant itself, ESMA, the relevant competent authorities or national surveillance authorities, where applicable.  Explanation of how newly created data is findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable, and meets high-quality standards  Table: Row 1 — The initiative promotes collection of data only once which is then shared with relevant competent authorities in MSs and relevant EU institutions via central databases. The requirements promote the transparency and accessibility to information using public registers, publication of reports and disclosures on ESMA web sites. Amendments to Regulation (EU) 600/2014 (MiFIR) For Article 22b and Article 25, there is no newly created data. Such data is already subject to harmonised data formats and in a machine-readable format, thus already ensuring consistency and completeness, which facilitates seamless interoperability and reuse. For Article 38fd, the data will be easily accessible via the central database. It will be stored there, and therefore reusable. Since the format for providing the mandatory data will be harmonised, the data will also be interoperable. Amendments to Regulation (EU) 684/2012 (EMIR) All information, data, communications and requests transmitted under EMIR are done via the central database and stored therein. All stakeholders with legal rights to access such transmissions may do so by connecting to the central database. Full reuse and sharing of relevant transmissions is thus ensured. Amendments to Regulation (EU) 909/2014 (CSDR) All information, data, communications and requests transmitted under the CSDR are done via the central database and stored therein. All stakeholders with legal rights to access such transmissions may do so by connecting to the central database. Full reuse and sharing of relevant transmissions is thus ensured.

During this phase, staff to prepare for new mandates should be recruited. It is expected that 10 FTEs, plus 2 FTEs overhead per sector will be needed for this work. The assumption retained is that ESMA will have time to recruit additional FTEs so that they are operational from 2028-mid-2028.  · The Executive Board will be installed, one year after entry into force, mid-2028 to start laying the ground for direct supervision and preparing cooperation arrangements. As of mid-2029 direct supervision starts – full staffing for trading and post-trading should be achieved by this date. Full staffing for the supervision of crypto asset service providers should , however, be achieved gradually until 2031. The standard annual cost retained (2025 current) for a Temporary Agent is EUR 188 000, for a Contract Agent, it is EUR 101 000 and for a Seconded National Expert it is EUR 103 000, all of which include EUR 30 000 of ‘habillage’ costs.  · The correction coefficient applicable to staff salaries in Paris (ESMA) is 114,2 (2025 basis);  · Employer’s pension contributions for Temporary Agents and Contract Agents have not been included in the estimates. For fee-funded direct supervisory tasks, 100% of the employer’s pension contributions would be included in the fees charged to the supervised entities. For non-direct supervisory tasks, the cost of which would be borne by the EU and the NCAs, the NCA share of such contributions, would as is the case now, be paid by NCAs to ESMA (the EU share being borne directly by the Union budget and not passing through the ESMA budget).  · Resource overhead staff are contract agents, temporary agents including assistants, and seconded national experts.  · A 2% inflation rate was applied as from 2027 on the 2025 standard rates.  Title II – Infrastructure and operating expenditure  Costs are based upon multiplying the number of staff by the proportion of the year employed by the standard cost for ‘habillage’, i.e. EUR 30 000 (covering buildings, IT basic support, etc.). A 2% inflation rate is applied.  Title III – Operational expenditure  Costs are estimated subject to the following assumptions:  · The one-off IT costs set out in section D are assumed to be implemented evenly over two years (2028-2029 for the Supervisory Platform, the CASP market surveillance system and the funds database; 2030-2031 for the centralised data and analytics), taking account of the time needed for preparation, planning and contracting.  · IT costs (development and maintenance) are based on best estimates of marginal supplementary expenses to be actually incurred over years 2028 to 2034 and allocated to either direct supervision or supervisory activities and their respective funding scheme.  · As an exception to the applicable funding scheme,  · t he costs of IT development that is linked to direct supervision will be paid for by the EU at the development stage and recovered over the subsequent five years via a reduction of the EU contribution, corresponding to the depreciated costs of the IT infrastructure for an amount of EUR 12.2 million . The subsequent annual maintenance costs (and any evolutionary development) will be fully fee-funded and would be borne from 2030 .  · the initial cost of the development of the new IT systems that are not linked to direct supervision, which are required for the implementation of this proposal, will be 100% paid by the EU (up to EUR 18.1 million after inflation). Thereafter, the costs of maintenance and evolutionary development of these systems would be borne equally by the EU and NCAs.  · A 2% inflation rate was applied as from 2027 on the 2025 current prices .  · M ission expenses , c ommunications services and g eneral meeting expenses are included as 1.25% of staff expenditure (Title 1), based on actual costs incurred at ESMA. This results in the following additional expenses:  Table: Row 1 — € million; 2028; 2029; 2030; 2031; 2032; 2033; 2034 Row 2 — EU share; 0,008; 0,027; 0,027; 0,028; 0,028; 0,029; 0,029 Row 3 — NCA share; 0,008; 0,027; 0,027; 0,028; 0,028; 0,029; 0,029 Row 4 — Fee funded; 0,094; 0,611; 0,737; 0,885; 0,902; 0,920; 0,939 Row 5 — Total; 0,110; 0,664; 0,792; 0,940; 0,959; 0,978; 0,997  All Titles – co-financing  The co-financing retained, from 2028 on, is a 50% contribution from the EU and 50% from NCAs for all the supplementary activities introduced by this initiative, that are co-financed at ESMA. These rates differ slightly from the rates of 40% and 60%, respectively, usually retained for co-financing based on Recital 68 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 establishing ESMA. This modification would not entail any changes as regards the way contributions are calculated for the activities introduced before this initiative that are co-financed at ESMA (they would continue to be financed 4 0% contribution from the EU and 6 0% from NCAs ) and as regards the way contributions from Member States are made in accordance with the weighting of votes 51 . The rationale is that, in light of the considerable reinforcement of ESMA’s mandate and the increasing Union-wide nature of its supervisory responsibilities, the financing of its activities should more accurately reflect the Union interest served by its work. Strengthening ESMA’s role in ensuring consistent and effective supervision across the internal market delivers benefits that accrue to the Union economy as a whole, and it is therefore appropriate that a greater share of the associated costs be borne by the EU budget, alleviating the pressure on national competent authorities while preserving a balanced and proportionate cost-sharing arrangement. This adjustment supports a fairer distribution of financial contributions, enhances budgetary predictability for Member States, and promotes an efficient and resilient supervisory framework capable of ensuring the proper functioning and further integration of Union capital markets.  Specific Assumptions  This legislative initiative will have an impact on costs incurred because of the changes brought (A) to enhance supervisory convergence, (B) to provide direct supervisory powers to ESMA, (C) overheads resources, (D) IT tools necessary for direct supervision and supervisory convergence, (E) to set up a new independent Executive Board. Finally, redeployment possibilities and efficiency gains have been explored (F).

Additionally, on the side of the Commission, there is a resource need to accompany the additional sectoral and horizontal responsibilities of ESMA. To ensure effective policy oversight, coordination, and enforcement of the new supervisory framework, 4 AD officials will be required within the Commission. Each official would reinforce a key policy area affected by the initiative: digital finance, market infrastructure, asset management, and supervision and convergence. These staff will be responsible for ongoing monitoring of ESMA’s expanded mandates, assessing the impact of new supervisory arrangements, ensuring policy coherence across sectors, and maintaining structured engagement with ESMA, NCAs, and stakeholders. Given the breadth and technical depth of the reforms, this level of staffing is considered the minimum necessary to ensure continuity, timely follow-up, and effective alignment of supervisory and legislative developments across the capital markets framework.  A. Enhanced supervisory convergence  In the asset management area, ESMA would ensure a coordinated approach to the oversight of large cross-border asset management groups through a mandate to carry out, together with NCAs, periodical group-wide reviews of the supervisory approach for asset management companies, which should foster a converged NCA supervision of asset management groups’ activities. This would potentially include operations, management, risk monitoring, or the corporate structure of the largest asset managers. Beyond those periodic reviews of large asset managers groups, coordination under ESMA would include monitoring risks on an ongoing basis, using dashboards derived from supervisory data and risk indicators to identify emerging vulnerabilities, and initiating investigations by joint teams, if necessary. For this oversight, up to 15 of the largest cross-border asset management groups should be chosen. For each group 1 FTEs should be planned. In all, 15 FTEs would be necessary. These would be co-financed by the EU and NCAs.  ESMA would be actively involved in the seamless passporting of UCITS funds and AIFs by centralising notifications, operating collaboration platforms, thereby addressing NCAs disagreement or handling stakeholders’ complaints. ESMA would exercise binding mediation powers. ESMA would coordinate the single market supervision of UCITS and AIFs through the establishment of collaboration platforms. ESMA would: (i) set the agenda for such collaboration platforms; (ii) host regular collaboration platforms, manage workflows, and share relevant information on a dedicated IT tool (data platform, accessible to NCAs) for UCITS funds and AIFs operating in the single market; (iii) initiate ad hoc collaboration platforms based on complaints from NCAs, market participants or consumers; and (iv) facilitate between NCAs in the collaboration platform. ESMA’s Executive Board and Board of Supervisors would have to play important roles in this regard. For this cross-border oversight, 15 FTEs should be planned. After a transitional period in 2028 with 5 FTEs fully financed by the EU to set up the function, ESMA would cover the cost of these tasks via fees applicable for the expenditure relating to the passporting procedures.  The proposal also foresees changes to horizontal supervisory convergence tools that would enhance and incentivise their use, as well as the establishment of new ones. It is expected that ESMA will use binding mediation, peer reviews and breach of Union law tools more often. In addition, new tools that have proven their effectiveness in sector legislation, such as collaboration platforms, would be included in the supervisory toolset. Collaboration platforms with a strong role for ESMA, would facilitate coordination and information exchange between home and host supervisory authorities for significant cross-border activities. An additional 10 FTEs should be foreseen for these tasks. Furthermore, 10 existing FTEs will be moved internally to convergence activities related to direct supervision. These FTEs will henceforth be fee-funded.  ESMA’s strong coordination role in the DLT Pilot Regulation continues, and will require more resources , since the threshold of the Pilot is increased. This will lead to more businesses checking into the Pilot and more work for ESMA. Additionally, ESMA will be the direct supervisor for a new distributed model for settlement of financial instruments (“settlement scheme”). Therefore, the 2 FTEs currently allocated at ESMA should be reinforced by additional staff , so as to reach 7 FTE in total. There is hence a need to continue with the 2 FTEs foreseen for this area in the context of the initial DLT pilot regulation and for 5 additional FTEs (the 2 FTEs which ESMA was allocated for the period 2022 to 2026 to implement Regulation 2022/858 establishing the DLT Pilot regime 52 will be extended to 2027 and thereafter, from 2028 ESMA will be allocated additional 5 FTEs). In addition, to co-finance the 2 FTEs for the DLT Pilot in 2027 according to the current standard 60:40 NCA:EU funding model, ESMA will be allocated EUR 149 376 of Union contribution on top of the financial programming for 2027 financing) .  B. Direct supervisory powers  As a preliminary remark, it is worth recalling that entities subject to direct supervision by ESMA pay fees to ESMA (one-off costs for registration and recurrent costs for ongoing supervision). This is currently the case for credit rating agencies, trade repositories, securitisation repositories, data reporting service providers, etc.  Under this legislative proposal, ESMA will be in charge of the direct supervision of large cross-border CCPs (up to around 8), CSDs (up to around 14) and trading venues (around 10 groups which would mean 150-200 trading venues). In relation to CASPs, ESMA should supervise all CASPs (up to 615) and become the sole supervisor of this sector in the EU.  We have conducted an analysis to determine the necessary staffing requirements. We have sent questionnaires to NCAs, asking about FTEs dedicated to the supervision of these sectors. The numbers per sector presented below, are based on input received from the NCAs, also relying on expertise from ESMA and the Commission’s own assessments.  We have calculated that 104 FTE posts at ESMA will be required to ensure effective supervision of the largest cross-border trading venue groups. A consultation of NCAs as regards the FTE needs to supervise trading venues indicated an average of approximately 2 FTEs per supervised entity across the 19 NCAs which participated in the survey. It is assumed that this headcount reflects the average resource needed at the level of each market operator.  The scope of the proposal targets approximately 30-40 operators, which manage the largest trading venues in the Union (there are ongoing changes in the market that make it difficult to have the precise estimate). Considering the upper bound of the proposed range of operators in scope and taking into account the fact that ESMA will receive new competences regarding the oversight of the compliance by trading venues with the organisational requirements pertaining to market surveillance, this estimate is corrected upwards to 2.5 FTEs per market operator. 4 FTEs are considered necessary to work on supervisory convergence in this area.  The trading venues that would fall under ESMA supervision have been selected based on their substantial market shares and, in some cases, EU/cross-border dimension, necessitating a robust supervisory set-up. As ESMA has not held any supervisory power over trading venues so far, it is essential to establish a new structure to facilitate the effective exercise of these responsibilities. The requested staffing level of 104 FTE posts is deemed necessary to ensure that ESMA can adequately discharge its new supervisory duties and maintain the high standards of oversight expected of it.  With regard to CCPs, ESMA would assume responsibility for the direct supervision of up to 8 of the most significant EU CCPs. ESMA would act as the ultimate decision-maker for supervisory matters, ensuring consistency and convergence across jurisdictions. According to the data that we have received, our estimate is that direct supervision of a CCP would require, on average, 6 FTEs. Applying this estimate to 8 CCPs results in a total requirement of 48 FTEs. Considering that ESMA already performs certain CCP-related tasks, notably in the area of model validation, a degree of efficiency can be achieved, and the estimate can be reduced by around 10%. 4 FTEs are considered necessary to work on supervisory convergence in this area. Consequently, the net additional staffing need for the supervision of CCPs is assessed at approximately 47 FTEs.  Turning to CSDs, ESMA would directly supervise the CSDs belonging to the largest European groups which together comprise up to 14 CSDs. For the purpose of this assessment, the CSDs should be broadly classified according to their systemic importance and scale of activity. The two international CSDs are expected to require more extensive supervisory engagement than medium-sized or small CSDs. Accordingly, the resource estimate takes into account the need for proportionality between different types of institutions. It is therefore assumed that the supervision of international CSDs would each require approximately 6 FTEs, medium-sized CSDs 3 FTEs, and smaller CSDs 2 FTEs. On this basis, the total supervisory resources required for the 14 CSDs belonging to the main EU groups are assessed at around 41 FTEs.  Given the expected synergies arising from the group structure of these entities, it is reasonable to expect that these FTE needs could be reduced by around one quarter. This would place the lower bound of the estimate at approximately 31 FTEs. In addition, 3-4 FTEs would be required for the cooperation and oversight tasks related to the TARGET2-Securities platform. 4 FTEs are considered necessary to work on supervisory convergence in this area. Taking these factors together, the overall FTE requirement for the direct supervision of CSDs is estimated to reach 39 FTEs.  Crypto assets is a new area and NCAs are only building their capacity and knowledge. Therefore, it is not possible to rely on current practice. For the purpose of this assessment, the CASPs should be broadly classified according to their systemic importance and scale of activity. Therefore, we can group them as significant and non-significant CASPs. For significant CASPs there would be 2.5 FTE/CASPs, for non-significant – 5 CASPs/FTE. 1 FTE is considered necessary to work on supervisory convergence in this area. In total it would be 158 FTEs for around 600 CASPs.  C. Overhead  The overheads in terms of resources support at the ESMA agency level cover Human Resources, Finance, Legal, Facility Management, Coordination and IT support. Based on ESMA's Activity Based Management system, 30% of the resources are dedicated to horizontal services. Taking into account that ESMA, while growing, can further develop economies of scale, we assumed in this Legislative Financial Statement that the overheads in terms of resources and the legal support would represent 20% of the total staff.  D. IT tools necessary for direct supervision and supervisory convergence  Supervisory data platform coverage of CCPs, CSDs, TV and for the designation and registration of systems under the Settlement Finality Regulation (SFR)  Estimated cost: EUR 8M for development and EUR 3.7M for annual maintenance. Based on actual use across all supervision mandates, the platform would cover up to 80% of direct supervisory needs and up to 20% of other activities via functionalities supporting document collaboration and notifications between Union and Member State authorities.  Based on the funding approach adopted for the development of the IT systems, the EU would fund 100% of the development cost. Thereafter, the share of the depreciated cost applicable to direct supervision mandates would be recovered via fees.  Based upon, activity based costing, the cost of the maintenance (and evolutionary development) of the system(s) would be split between fees charged to directly supervised entities on the one side and between the EU and NCAs on the other side for non-direct supervision tasks (with that part of the cost being split equally between the EU and the NCAs).  ESMA has multiple mandates in Union legislation to develop and maintain databases and tools for the submission, exchange and access to supervisory information. To ensure these systems are developed and maintained efficiently, to avoid duplication of IT investments, and to ensure the accuracy and interoperability of data, the supervisory data platform should integrate ESMA’s existing supervisory databases and related tools within a single architecture.  Accordingly, ESMA's supervisory platform, initially designed to support supervisory tasks under EMIR 3, should therefore be expanded to include data collection and management for supervisory oversight of CSDs, CCPs, and TVs and to provide the additional capabilities required for the Settlement Finality Regulation, building on this integrated technical architecture. The Commission estimates that integrating the management of ESMA’s supervision mandates within a single supervisory data platform allows for a more efficient solution and results in a lower overall cost compared with developing separate systems for the new supervisory mandates individually.  Maintenance should cover the full cost of operating the platform, including high-quality support to all stakeholders — staff from the ESAs and other Union institutions and bodies, competent authorities and supervised entities — as well as system and security operations, corrective, preventive and adaptive maintenance such as mandatory lifecycle and security upgrades and incremental functional enhancements. It should also include the necessary infrastructure to ensure continuous availability and performance of the platform, in particular the sufficient compute and storage capacity required for the collection, processing and retention of both unstructured (e.g. documents) and structured (e.g. prudential) information used for supervisory risk assessments.  All relevant competent authorities and bodies should have access to such a platform for the information pertinent to their tasks and responsibilities. Similarly, entities subject to the requirements of corresponding regulations should have access to the information and documentation they submitted, and any information and documentation addressed to them. The data platform should be used for the swift and efficient sharing of as much information and documentation as possible.  Central register for CASPs markets surveillance  Estimated cost: EUR 4.2M for development and EUR 2.5M for annual maintenance. The costs of development will be paid for by the EU and recovered over the subsequent five years via a reduction of the EU contribution, corresponding to the depreciated costs of the IT infrastructure. The annual maintenance costs will be fully fee-funded.  ESMA is expected to develop and operate a centralised data and market surveillance system for CASPs, building on the ongoing work on MIDAS (Markets Integrity Data Analysis System). The system would serve as a pan-EU data hub for the collection, aggregation, and analysis of transaction and order data reported by CASPs under MiCA and related implementing acts. Its core purpose would be to enhance market integrity, detect market abuse, and support both direct and indirect supervision of crypto markets.  The system would integrate regulatory and market data flows collected directly from CASPs, ensuring consistent and harmonised data access across the EU, and enabling timely identification of potential risks. ESMA would operate as a central analytics and monitoring centre, responsible for:  – Collecting and standardising data from CASPs and trading platforms across Member States;  – Running advanced data analytics and surveillance algorithms to detect suspicious or abusive trading behaviour, price manipulation, or insider dealing;  – Flagging potential issues or anomalies for investigation and enforcement;  – Providing aggregated insights to support ESMA’s own direct supervision of CASPs and to facilitate cooperation with national competent authorities.  The Commission estimates that the current system developed by ESMA for MiCA monitoring by NCAs will be adapted to a centralised model, with costs proportionate to the number of CASPs to be integrated into the system.  Maintenance should cover the full operational cost of running the system, including high-quality support for all stakeholders — staff from the ESAs and other Union entities, competent authorities, and supervised entities — as well as system and security operations and corrective, preventive and adaptive maintenance, such as mandatory lifecycle and security upgrades and incremental capability improvements. It should also finance the necessary infrastructure, including sufficient compute and storage capacity for the collection, processing and retention of unstructured (e.g. documents) and structured information (e.g. prudential data) used for supervisory risk assessments. The system should therefore ensure continuous availability, data integrity and security, and support the efficient execution of ESMA’s supervisory functions.  Data platform for cross-border notifications of funds and interaction between home and host NCAs on cross-border matters  Estimated cost: EUR 1,000,000 for development and EUR 200,000 for annual maintenance. The costs of development will be paid for by the EU and recovered over the subsequent five years via a reduction of the EU contribution, corresponding to the depreciated costs of the IT infrastructure. The annual maintenance costs (and any evolutionary development costs) will be fully fee-funded.  This cost reflects an upgrade of the existing register in the ESAP system, which currently stores information on cross-border fund activities, in order to include additional information required to support enhanced supervisory cooperation under the AIFMD and UCITS frameworks, while maintaining data collection via NCAs. The objective is to develop a one-stop-shop system that reduces the need for multiple bilateral exchanges currently required between home and host competent authorities and stakeholders in the context of the notification of the cross-border marketing of funds. This system will serve as a central interface for ESMA and the 27 NCAs, providing a secure channel for home–host documentation access and communication of procedural steps. It will provide funds and managers with a single point accessing information for cross-border activities more generally. To deliver these capabilities, the system must store and provide submission functionalities for reliable, always up-to-date and quality-checked documentation, including automated translation services for submitted documents.  The data platform must be up to date at all times so that information is accurate and reliable and allows for immediate access for both NCAs and stakeholders.  Key functionalities include:  – interconnectedness between ESMA and all 27 NCAs, ensuring secure and timely data exchange,  – automatic translation into official languages of the Union, supporting direct usability across Member States ,  – a public portal for transparency,  – user friendly interfaces, for both non-public and public information to share, access and retrieve information in a secure and efficient manner.  Centralised data and analytics  Estimated cost: EUR 15M for development and EUR 4M annual maintenance. The EU would support 100% of the development costs of that platform over 2030 and 2031.  For this the EU would increase its contribution in order to further fund this development, by adding an amount of EUR 8.2 million to the amount that would be expected on the basis of a 50% contribution to ESMA for that development, thus reducing the NCAs contribution by the same amount. The annual maintenance (and any further evolutionary development) would be co-financed equally by EU and NCAs.  This initiative will contribute to the development of supervisory technology tools and to the efficient exchange of information within the EU as part of a common Union financial data strategy.  Funding will support the progressive enhancement of ESMA’s central systems to provide the functionalities listed below covering all the relevant mandates under Union legislation:  – provide common tools for market analysis and supervision, in collaboration with competent authorities;  – enable timely sharing of supervisory insights with competent authorities; and  – facilitate secure, standardised data access and exchange across the EU supervisory framework.  These shared solutions are expected to create efficiencies for competent authorities and support consistent supervisory practices in the Union.

New Executive Board  A new Executive Board would be composed of ESMA’s Chair and 5 full time independent members, with diverse composition, bringing different types of supervisory expertise (e.g. CCPs, CSD, trading venues, asset managers/funds, prudential, central banks, etc.). They should be experienced and should be recruited as AD temporary agents of a grade of AD 14. The Executive Director would equally be recruited as an AD 14 temporary agent. The Executive Board would be the main decision-making body for direct supervision and supervisory convergence measures that target individual entities. The Executive Board would also take over the tasks of the current Management Board. The Executive Board will be operational as of mid-2028. Tasks linked to direct supervision would be financed through fees, and tasks linked to supervisory convergence (up to 10% of total tasks) would be co-financed by the Union budget and NCA’s contributions.  F. Redeployment and efficiency gains  The scope for redeployment is limited, considering the nature and scope of this initiative. Nevertheless, efficiency gains have been examined thoroughly in order to limit costs, wherever possible. For instance, as explained above, economies of scale are anticipated in the extent of additional overhead needed.  A key efficiency is that ESMA’s current capacity to levy fees would be largely relied upon to deal with the increased number of entities to be charged. In particular, no specific IT developments are included as regards fees management, as it is expected that ESMA will rely on their current IT systems, to handle the extended scope of application.  In order to further reduce the costs incurred by ESMA, a large number of new FTEs could be employed as Contract Agents (CAs), Assistants (AST) or Seconded National Experts (SNEs). However, the number of SNEs should not be overestimated. ESMA might face difficulties in recruiting such experts because of the costs this would represent for Member States and national competent authorities. In addition to these difficulties related to their availability, in the area of direct supervision, it should be expected that they will provide essential experience when ESMA takes up those tasks, but in the long run beyond the start-up phase it will be more important for ESMA to maintain expertise in-house and rely relatively more on Temporary Agent staff.  The following table provides for an indicative split of staff into those categories.

CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  Union legislation should deliver its policy objectives efficiently, effectively and transparently. These longstanding principles can be traced back to the 2001 White paper on Governance ( 1 ) which put better regulation and stakeholder engagement at the heart of European policymaking. The Competitiveness Compass ( 2 ) continues the promotion of responsible law-making . It announced unprecedented efforts to simplify legislation to reignite the competitiveness of European business. Moreover, the Commission has since strengthened targets to reduce administrative costs for business (together with public authorities) and Small and Medium sized Entreprises by 25% and 35% respectively ( 3 ).  A mature body of Union environmental law now exists. The Commission takes seriously its duty to manage these laws effectively and invests heavily in reviewing ( 4 ) their application to ensure that they deliver as intended and that problematic issues are tackled early. Moreover, the Commission is committed to ‘stress-test’ all EU laws under its current term of office. The content of this proposal (and others in the ‘omnibus’ package) represents the initial fruits of the Commission’s ongoing ‘stress-testing’ in the environment area ( 5 ) built on extensive dialogue and inputs from civil society. The omnibus package addresses legislation related to the circular economy, the operation of industrial installations, the management of geospatial data, and environmental permitting.  The above legislation are crucial parts of delivering the Union’s commitment to a fair green, and digital transition and the shift towards a circular economy in particular. It is important that this legislation works well, mobilises the Union’s assets like the single market and avoids imposing unnecessary costs on business, public authorities and citizens.  This specific proposed Directive aims to reduce the administrative burden for producers established in one Member State of the Union selling their products in other Member States, in relation to the participation of these producers in the extended producer responsibility schemes in those other Member States, set up under the following EU instruments:  – Directive 2008/98/EC on waste ( 6 )  – Directive 2012/ 19/EU on waste electric and electronic equipment ( 7 )  – Directive (EU) 2019/904 on the reduction of the impact of certain plastic products on the environment ( 8 ).  This proposal suspends certain provisions of the above Directives in the area of environment, waste management. Further possible modifications of those Directives or further suspensions of their provisions are entirely outside of the scope and aims of the present proposal. The need for such modifications may be assessed, as appropriate, in the context of further stress-testing of EU environmental legislation announced in the [Chapeau Communication] and in Commission work programme 2026. The Commission will constructively engage with the co-legislators, in order to ensure that the legislative process on the present proposal fully preserves its essential object and does not distort it.  The producer of a product placed on the market of a Member State has the responsibility to cover the costs of managing the product at its end of life (so called ‘Extended Producer Responsibility or EPR). The Waste Framework Directive sets out the minimum general requirements for extended producer responsibility while specific rules for different product groups exist in other legislation such as the Regulation on packaging and packaging waste, the Regulation on batteries and waste batteries, the Directive on electrical and electronical waste, and the Single Use Plastics Directiv e , as well the Directive on end-of-life vehicles (currently subject to revision under an ongoing ordinary legislative procedure) ( 9 ). Member States may also establish national rules on extended producer responsibility for other products, provided these rules comply with the minimum requirements set out in Article 8 and 8a of the Waste Framework Directive.  An authorised representative for EPR acts on behalf of an economic operator (producer) selling products in a Member State where the producer is not established or if it is established in a third country. The purpose is to ensure that producers making available products on the territory of a Member State comply with the rules on EPR so that the costs of waste management are covered.  In the May 2025 Communication on a strategy for the single market( 10 ), the Commission highlighted the complexity of EPR rules as a major barrier in the internal market, in particular the possibility or obligation for a producer to have an authorised representative for EPR in each Member State where the producer makes its products available .  The proposal would provide additional flexibility by allowing producers established in the Union and selling products in another Member State to choose whether they appoint an authorised representative for EPR. Provisions regarding the appointment of authorised representatives for EPR for producers based in third countries should remain as they currently are contained in sectoral legislation.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  The current proposal promotes a similar approach across circular economy/waste legislation regarding the operation of schemes for extended producer responsibility. This will facilitate the functioning of the internal market while aiding business operations.  • Consistency with other Union policies  This proposal is part of a package of measures aimed primarily at cutting red tape for economic operators. It is entirely consistent with the Commission’s policies on better regulation, and the objectives of the Competitiveness compass to promote greater competitiveness and economic resilience in the Union. The rationalisation introduced by these measures will not affect the achievement of the objectives in the concerned policy area nor the rationale of the legislative acts  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  The legal base of the proposal is 192(1) TFEU. This reflects the underlying legal bases of the Directives containing provisions on authorised representatives for extended producer responsibility that the proposal suspends.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  Directive on Waste: Waste is a commodity that can cross national borders and will increasingly do so as progress is made in establishing a circular economy. Common rules and approaches are needed across the Union to ensure that waste is managed uniformly and that materials are reused and recycled in the same ways in order that markets can function efficiently. Changes to the rules on waste therefore must also be addressed at Union level.  Directive preventing harm from certain plastic items (single use plastics): Litter does not respect national borders and litter from one member State can be found the seas and beaches of another member State. Moreover, measures needed to tackle litter need to be consistent in order to prevent fragmentation in the functioning of markets in certain products. The EU Directive on single use products is therefore necessary and provides added value above what Member States could achieve acting alone. Changes to these rules also require action at EU level.  Directive on waste electrical and electronical equipment: Electrical and electronical waste is a commodity that can cross national borders and will increasingly do so as progress is made in establishing a circular economy. Common rules and approaches are needed across the Union to ensure that electric and electronic waste is managed uniformly and that materials are reused and recycled in the same ways in order that markets can function efficiently. Changes to the rules on electrical and electronical waste therefore must also be addressed at Union level.  • Proportionality  In the case of the circular economy legislation, the proposal would introduce alternative means to deliver the policy objectives of ensuring that waste products are appropriately managed at the end of their useful life. These respond to the concerns of producers operating across Member States.  • Choice of the instrument  A proposal for a Directive is the appropriate choice of instrument given that the pieces of legislation the proposal suspends are Directives.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  A targeted revision of t he Directive on waste was recently adopted by the Legislator based on a Commission proposal that was supported by an impact assessment. The targeted revision introduced a new obligation for the Commission to evaluate the Directive by end 2029 and amend if appropriate. An evaluation of t he Directive on waste electrical and electronical equipment has recently been conducted 11 . An evaluation of the Directive on preventing harm from certain plastics products is ongoing and completion is expected in 2027.  • Stakeholder consultations  The staff working document accompanying this proposal provides more information on the various consultation activities that have been undertaken to support the preparation of this proposal. The key consultation activities are summarised below.  The following consultation activities have been carried out to prepare this omnibus proposal:  – A call for evidence 12 for the environmental omnibus open for feedback from 22 July 2025 to 10 September 2025.  – A high-level roundtable on simplifying environmental laws on 2 October 2025.  The call for evidence on environmental simplification drew a lot of attention . The Commission published a call for evidence on the environmental simplification package on the Have-Your-Say website: Simplification of administrative burdens in environmental legislation . The feedback period was from 22 July 2025 till 10 September 2025. All feedback is published on the Have-Your-Say website.  There were 190 998 contributions to the call for evidence, of which 189 751 (99.3%) came from citizens. 1 247 (0.7%) contributions came from organisations other than citizens, including businesses and business associations, non-governmental organisations (environmental and other), public authorities and academics. 622 attachments, mainly position papers, were attached to these submissions, which often included specific suggestions.  From a business perspective, there is support for less burdensome regulation that leaves business with flexibility to deliver both growth and sustainable production. There is a perception of administrative obligations that are too prescriptive, and do not provide value added.  On the side of civil society, there is support for a simplification that makes it easier to protect the environment and social standards and avoid deregulation, for example by removing redundancies and avoiding excessively detailed regulations. There is however concern that efforts to simplify regulations could undermine environmental protections. Citizens urged the EU to focus on enforcing existing laws rather than creating new simplifications.  The Commission is currently preparing an impact assessment to support the preparation of the Circular Economy Act in 2026. This assessment will utilise ongoing consultation activities that will also cover simplification of existing (waste and circular economy-related) legislation, and particularly EPR related legislation.  • Collection and use of expertise  The Commission contracted an external service provider to provide expertise related to this proposal. In particular, the contractor has screened the known body of environmental laws to identify reporting and other administrative obligations together with potential to simplify these obligations. In addition, the contractor has provided assistance in quantifying the reductions in costs of possible measures to simplify provisions in the omnibus package. All information provided by the contractor will be published.  • Impact assessment  An impact assessment has not been prepared primarily because the proposal is highly specific with little choice available to remedy the underlying issues. A staff working document does however accompany this proposal. It justifies the content of the proposal and presents quantitative information about the expected impacts. It also presents the views and inputs of stakeholders which the Commission has received.  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  Under the regulatory fitness and performance programme (REFIT), the Commission ensures that its legislation is fit for purpose, targeted to the needs of stakeholders, and minimises burdens while achieving its objectives. This proposal is therefore part of, and fully coherent with, the REFIT programme in so far as it attempts to simplify administrative procedures related to the appointment of authorised representatives for extended producer responsibility and reduce unnecessary costs for producers.  • Fundamental rights  The proposal has no adverse impact on fundamental rights as enshrined in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights as it solely impacts the appointment of an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility.4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  Not applicable.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  Given the very specific nature of the proposal, there is no need for implementation plans to guide the transposition and application of the new provisions. Existing monitoring and reporting provisions in the affected Directives will continue.  • Explanatory documents (for directives)  Given the very specific nature of the proposal, there is no need to require explanatory documents from the Member States regarding their transposition.  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  Article 1 suspends the application of Article 22a(3), first subparagraph, of Directive 2008/98/EC, Article 17(2) of Directive 2012/19/EU and Article 8(7) of Directive 2019/904 until January 2035.  2025/0396 (COD)  Proposal for a  DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  suspending the application of the rules on the appointment of authorised representatives for extended producer responsibility for waste, waste electrical and electronical equipment and single use plastic waste  (Text with EEA relevance)  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192(1) thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 13 ,  Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions 14 ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) The political guidelines for the Commission’s 2024-2029 term 15 point to the goal of simplifying, consolidating and codifying legislation to eliminate any overlaps and contradictions while maintaining high standards and staying the course on the goals set out in the European Green Deal .  (2) In its Communication of 11 February 2025 entitled ‘A simpler and faster Europe: Communication on implementation and simplification’, 16 the European Commission set out a vision for an implementation and simplification agenda that delivers fast and visible improvements for people and business on the ground. That requires more than an incremental approach and the Union is to take bold action to achieve that goal. The European Parliament, the Council, the Commission, the Member States’ authorities at all levels and stakeholders need to work together to streamline and simplify Union , national and regional rules and implement policies more effectively.  (3) In its Communication on a Strategy for the Single Market 17 , the Commission identified as a barrier to the internal market t hat b usinesses face inconsistent national regulations which makes it harder to sell, scale or move goods and services across borders. The Commission committed to focus on the ten most harmful barriers as a priority . The Communication identified c ertain features of extended producer responsibility schemes as one of the barriers most frequently reported by companies operating cross-border in the Union . While extended producer responsibility schemes are derived from Union legislation, a lack of uniformity of principles and requirements has led to a large diversity of extended producer responsibility schemes set up in Member States as well as to regulatory complexity and high administrative burden for companies. Th is Directive is a first stepping stone to more profound simplification of the extended producer responsibility schemes in the area of waste, while the upcoming Circular Economy act should provide for further simplification.  (4) In particular, d ue to that lack of harmonisation , in particular regarding the current provisions in sectoral legislation for the appointment of an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility , the fulfilment of the obligations related to the appointment may result in an unnecessary administrative burden on producers operating in multiple Member States where they are not established . Particularly for small and m edium -sized enterprises , the obligation to appoint authorised representatives separately for every Member State where the producer places products on the market pose s a significant challenge in terms of costs . With a view to ensuring equal conditions for producers established in the Union , it is important that the rules for appointing an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility in Directives 2008/98/EC 18 , 2012 /19/EU 19 and (EU) 2019/904 20 of the European Parliament and of the Council have the same content . The current ly fragment ed legal framework for different products and the significant administrative burden associated with fulfilling the requirement to appoint an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility in up to 2 6 Member States is hampering the competitiveness of producers established in the Union . It is thus crucial to harmonise the existing rules effectively and promptly, reducing the associated burdens on producers . To this effect, the Commission is currently review ing the effective ness, the administrative burden entailed and the unintended barriers for the internal market , of the obligation to appoint authorised representative s as a safeguard for the producers’ compliance with the ‘polluter pays‘ principle. This review is likely to lead to alternative solutions which are more effective and less burdensome .  (5) W ith a view to simplifying requirements on producers , and reducing the administrative burden, producers of textile, textile-related or footwear , electrical and electronical equipment and single use plastic products (‘producers’) should be able to choose whether they appoint an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility when making available products on the market of a nother Member State where they are not established. Therefore , Member States should not make the appointment of an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility mandatory for producers established in the Union , but the option for producers to appoint an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility at their discretion should be maintained . This allows producers who have already appointed an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility to retain their existing arrangements , while immediately alleviating the costs and administrative burden for producers who wish to not appoint an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility .  (6) Ensuring traceability and enforcement with regards to producers established in third countries is more challenging compared to those operating within the Union, as such producers fall outside the territorial scope of Member States’ enforcement powers and are not covered by the U nion administrative and judicial cooperation mechanisms that facilitate the enforcement of obligations and judgments within the internal market . Making the appointment of an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility voluntary for producers established in third countr ies could thus increase the risk of freeriding , where producers do not fulfil their legal obligations such as registration, reporting, providing a guarantee or participating in a collective scheme , and c ould create loopholes for non-compliant producers established in third countries . Thus, the provision in Directive 2008/98/EC that allows Member States to provide that a producer established in a third country and making textile, textile-related or footwear products available for the first time on their territory by means of distance contracts directly to end-users is to appoint, by written mandate, a legal or natural person established on their territory as its authorised representative for the purpose of fulfilling the obligations of a producer related to the extended producer responsibility scheme on their territory should remain applicable . However, Member States should be allowed to ensure traceability and enforcement with regard to producers established in third countries through alternative means.  (7) Th e provisions in Directives 2008/98/EC, 2012/19/EU and (EU) 2019/904 which make the appointment of an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility mandatory should be suspended until 1 January 2035.  (8) The Commission is prepar ing a legislative proposal for a comprehensive reform of the extended producer responsibility system . The proposal is expected to be tabled by the Commission, in accordance with its Work Programme, in 2026. The legislative proposal will be subject to the ordinary legislative procedure and, if adopted by the European Parliament and by the Council, the Member States and the producers will have to take the necessary measures to align their regulatory and organisational measures, as well as their conduct to the new rules with regard to the extended producer responsibility .  (9) The provisions in Directives 2008/98/EC, 2012/19/EU and (EU) 2019/904 that currently set out that Member States are to allow producers established in the Union to appoint an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility leave a margin of discretion to Member States. Member States should not make the appointment of an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility mandatory in their national legislation.  (10) Suspending the application of the requirement for producers established in a Member State to appoint authori s ed representative s for extended producer responsibility when selling products in other Member States serves as a preliminary measure to immediately alleviate burdens and costs for producers who wish to not appoint an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility. This approach pav es the way for the implementation of a comprehensive reform of the extended producer responsibility system .  (11) Since the objectives of this Directive, namely to provide flexibility to producers established in the Union as to whether they appoint an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility , cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives ,  (12)  HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:  Article 1  Suspension  The application of the following provisions is suspended until 1 January 2035:  (a) Article 22a ( 3 ) of Directive 2008/98/EC .  Member States may either provide that a producer as defined in Article 3(4b), point (d), of that Directive established in a third country and making textile, textile-related or footwear products listed in Annex IVc of that Directive available for the first time on their territory is to appoint, by written mandate, a legal or natural person established on their territory as its authorised representative for the purpose of fulfilling the obligations of a producer related to the extended producer responsibility scheme on their territory or ensure traceability and enforcement with regard to producers established in third countries through alternative means;  (b) Article 17 (2) of Directive 2012/19 /EU ;  (c) Article 8 ( 7 ) of Directive (EU) 2019/904 .  Article 2  Transposition  1. Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by [OP: please insert date 1 2 months after entry into force of this Directive] at the latest. They shall forthwith communicate to the Commission the text of those provisions.  When Member States adopt those provisions, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or be accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication. Member States shall determine how such reference is to be made.  2. Member States shall communicate to the Commission the text of the main provisions of national law which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive.

FRAMEWORK OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE  1.1. Title of the proposal/initiative  Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council suspending the application of the rules on the appointment of authorised representatives for extended producer responsibility for waste, waste electrical and electronical equipment and single use plastic waste  1.2. Policy area(s) concerned  Environment  European Green Deal  1.3. Objective(s)  1.3.1. General objective(s)  The general objective pursued by this legislative proposal is to simplify elements of Directives 2008/98/EC, 2012/19/EU and (EU) 2019/904 with regard to the appointment of an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility.  1.3.2. Specific objective(s)  By suspending the application of the provisions in Regulation of Directives 2008/98/EC, 2012/19/EU and (EU) 2019/904 that mandate the appointment of an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility for producers established in the Union, such producers will be able to choose whether they appoint an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility when making available products on the market of another Member State where they are not established, but the appointment will not be mandatory. This allows those producers who have already appointed an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility to retain their existing arrangements, while immediately alleviating the costs and administrative burden for producers who wish to not appoint an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility.  1.3.3. Expected result(s) and impact  Specify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.  The proposed suspension of the application of the mandatory appointment of an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility for producers established in the Union will alleviate administrative burden and costs from the producers of packaging and batteries. Especially SMEs will benefit from not having to appoint an authorised representatives.  1.3.4. Indicators of performance  Specify the indicators for monitoring progress and achievements. To monitor progress towards achieving the proposal’s specific objectives, the Commission will explore the possibility of organising exchanges with Member States in different formats, including by using the existing fora.  1.4. The proposal/initiative relates to:   a new action   a new action following a pilot project / preparatory action 21   the extension of an existing action   a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action  1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative  1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative  The suspension should apply until 1 January 2035.  1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, greater effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this section 'added value of EU involvement' is the value resulting from EU action, that is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone. The proposal will create a harmonised approach across sectoral legislation. To ensure uniform conditions for producers within the Union, it is essential that the same provisions are applied across Member States for appointing an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility. The existing fragmented legal framework for various products and the administrative challenges linked with appointing an authorised representative in up to 26 Member States are hindering the competitiveness of Union-based producers. It is necessary to efficiently and swiftly harmonise the current rules, thereby alleviating the burdens faced by these producers.  1.5.3.

 REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulation (EU) 2021/691 as regards support to workers affected by imminent job displacement in enterprises undergoing restructuring  EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM  1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  The aim of this proposal is to enable the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for Displaced Workers (‘the EGF’) to not only support displaced workers, but also workers affected by imminent job displacement.  Employees of enterprises undergoing restructuring should be able to benefit from personalised packages of measures in case they are affected by imminent job displacement. To enable their employees to benefit from such support, enterprises undergoing restructuring may request the relevant Member State to submit an application for EGF assistance if the intervention criteria are met and if the enterprise wishes to offer EGF co-financed assistance.  Restructuring events often occur in a series of waves of lay-offs. Under its current set-up, the EGF is only able to help workers that have already lost their jobs. However, if it is already known when a next batch of workers will lose their jobs, they should be helped in response to this imminent threat so as to mitigate its impact.  Whereas longer-term anticipatory assistance falls under the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+), the EGF is an emergency instrument to respond to restructuring events. This proposal supports and strengthens the emergency character of the EGF. In the short term, it is often not possible to reprogramme ESF+ funding, and enterprises undergoing restructuring have limited means to support the workers affected by redundancy. The EGF could fill this gap by responding to restructuring events occurring over a mid-term timeframe.  According to the Autumn 2024 Economic Forecast, growth in the EU is expected to pick up to 1.5% in 2025, as consumption shifts up a gear and investment is set to rebound from the contraction of 2024. However, elevated uncertainty and structural shifts are expected to weigh on segments of the economy, notably in manufacturing. Whereas the EU experienced a phase of extraordinary employment growth over the past few years, data from Eurofound’s European Restructuring Monitor show that the tide has been turning since 2024. The number of jobs cuts announced for the near future related to large-scale restructuring within the EU now far exceeds the number of job creations.  According to the data collected by the European Restructuring Monitor, large-scale restructuring across all countries observed and all sectors lasted for more than a year (387 days). The larger the restructuring event, the longer the duration. For restructuring events involving more than 3 000 workers, the average duration is almost 1 000 days.  Economic disruptions, for example those caused by the twin transition or by globalisation, have adverse effects on workers whose skills are no longer needed. However, employment contraction can go hand-in-hand with labour and skills shortages. Therefore, the workers concerned must be supported by access to active labour market policy measures, such as education and retraining, to allow them to acquire the skills needed to move into new roles or jobs.  In light of the twin transition and new geopolitical challenges, it is vital to enhance productivity growth while ensuring social inclusion and preserving equity, to ensure that workers benefit from EU solidarity.  This proposal is therefore needed to cushion the adverse effects economic disruptions have on the workforce, and to boost the EU’s economic competitiveness. It underlines the character of the EGF as a reactive emergency response instrument to assist workers who are affected by imminent job displacement in enterprises undergoing restructuring.  The support provided to those workers would consist of packages of personalised services to equip them with the skills needed to move into a different role, or to change jobs. Short-time work schemes are not eligible given they are funded by Member States’ national budgets. Extending EU solidarity to those workers through such support would take into account existing support that are available to them at national level.  Workers who are affected by imminent job displacement or anticipate job displacement in enterprises undergoing restructuring can benefit from EGF support under the provisions setting the support available to displaced workers.  In the current context of economic disruptions, it is vital to support both workers who are made redundant and workers who anticipate imminent job displacement by accelerating the procedure to mobilise EGF support. To achieve that, Regulation (EU) 2021/691 could set out a procedure whereby the Commission, under strict conditions, can request the European Parliament and the Council to mobilise the full maximum annual amount budget at the beginning of each year. If that mobilisation is approved, the Commission would adopt individual financing decisions in relation to the applications introduced by the EU countries concerned. The Commission will immediately inform the European Parliament and the Council of its adoption, including the conditions that led the Commission adopting the financing decisions, as well as the corresponding amounts.  If the full maximum annual amount is not used by the Commission in a given year, that amount will lapse at the end of the financial year.  The proposed amendment will be fully accommodated within the existing provisions of the MFF Regulation (Article 8 of Council Regulation 2020/2093 of 17 December (as amended by Council Regulation 2024/765 of 29 February 2024), as well as with the existing provisions of the Interinstitutional Agreement between the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission on budgetary discipline, cooperation in budgetary matters, sound financial management, and new own resources of 16 December 2020 (Point 9) (the IIA).  This proposal also assists enterprises undergoing restructuring in actively managing economic transitions in a socially responsible manner.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area and other Union policies  This proposal is one of the flagship actions under pillar 4 of the EU’s industrial action plan for the European automotive sector COM(2025) 95 final. It supports the aims of the Union of  Skills and the European Competitiveness Compass.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  The legal basis is the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), and in particular the third paragraph of Article 175.  If specific actions are needed that fall outside the scope of the EU Structural Funds, Article 175 third paragraph TFEU allows the European Parliament and the Council to take action in line with the ordinary legislative procedure and after consulting the European Economic and Social Committee and the European Committee of the Regions.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  Funding from the EU budget concentrates on activities whose objectives cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States alone, and where EU intervention can bring additional value compared to Member States acting alone. The mobilisation of the EGF to fund measures aimed at assisting displaced workers and those affected by imminent job displacement to find new employment respects the principle of subsidiarity and creates European added value.  It is standard practice for national labour market programmes to assist displaced workers, and it is also good practice for companies to train their workforce. The EGF does not aim to replace such programmes. In case of restructuring events that have a significant impact on the labour market, the national labour market programmes are put at test. Companies undergoing restructuring often have limited budgets to help their surplus employees adjust. Therefore, because of the scale and effects of large-scale restructuring and as the EGF is an expression of solidarity in Member States, assistance can be better delivered at EU level. EGF support will make EU solidarity more meaningful for workers that have been affected by restructuring events and for Europeans in general.  The mobilisation of the EGF creates added value by increasing the overall number of services offered to workers affected by restructuring events, as well as the variety of services offered and their level of intensity. The EGF can also test innovative ideas, identify best practices and incorporate them into the national support packages. EGF co-financed measures also contribute in general to improving the support available to workers facing job displacement.  • Proportionality  In line with the principle of proportionality, this proposal does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve its goals. The administrative burden on the EU and on the national authorities applying for EGF support has been limited to what is necessary for the Commission to exercise its responsibility in implementing the EU’s budget. Since the financial contribution is made to the EU country under the principle of shared management, that country will be required to report on how the funding was used.  • Choice of the instrument  Since this proposal amends Regulation (EU) 2021/691, the instrument has to be a Regulation.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  This proposal is adopted in response to the heightened economic uncertainty and risks as well as the fact that the EGF does not respond appropriately to restructuring events that occur over longer timeframes. The Commission has analysed the challenges and concluded that this proposal is needed to ensure that the EGF can respond effectively to show solidarity with workers, regions, and enterprises that have been affected.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  The EGF is a special instrument not included in the budgetary ceilings of the multiannual financial framework. Article 8(1) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2020/2093 laying down the multiannual financial framework for the years 2021 to 2027, as amended byArticle 1(4) of Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/765 of 29 February 2024, provides that the EGF may not exceed a maximum annual amount of EUR 30 million (in 2018 prices), based on Article 312 TFEU. This proposal, based on Article 175 TFEU, cannot amend the maximum annual amount.  The functioning of the EGF is governed by point 9 of the draft Interinstitutional Agreement between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial management. The present proposal is compatible with these provisions.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  The proposed amendments specify that announced job displacements that will occur over a certain timeframe in the near future fall within the EGF’s scope. The aim is to allow for a more common approach to job displacements triggered by large-scale restructuring events. Enterprises undergoing restructuring must be able to request EGF assistance through national authorities. The funding must be used to offer personalised packages of active labour market policy measures to workers that are affected by imminent job displacements in the near future.  Since the EGF is implemented under shared management, each EU country sets-up a single entry point to handle requests by enterprises. The EU country concerned then submits an application for EGF assistance. Expenses incurred by the applicant EU country for preparatory, management, information and publicity, and control and reporting activities relating to such applications must be co-financed at 100% across the EU.  In order to facilitate future evaluations, a beneficiary survey should be conducted after the implementation of each financial contribution from the EGF. The beneficiary survey is prepared by the Commission. As the enterprises are the only ones having access to the contact details of the beneficiaries, they should assist the Commission by sending out to the beneficiaries the invitation to take part in the survey. The Commission should use the collected data for evaluation purposes.  In order to implement this Regulation, in particular the guidance, information, evaluation and information measures, the Commission deems it necessary to raise the ceiling for the technical assistance to 1.5% of the EGF’s maximum annual amount.  2025/0073 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulation (EU) 2021/691 as regards support to workers affected by imminent job displacement in enterprises undergoing restructuring  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular the third paragraph of Article 175 thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 1 ,  Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions 2 ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council 3 established the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) for the multiannual financial framework from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013. The EGF was established to enable the Union to show solidarity towards workers who lost their jobs as a result of major structural changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation.  (2) The scope of the EGF was broadened in 2009 as part of the European Economic Recovery Plan to include support to workers made redundant as a direct consequence of the global financial and economic crisis.  (3) Regulation (EU) No 1309/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council 4 established the EGF for the period of the multiannual financial framework from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020. It also extended the scope of the EGF to cover redundances resulting from any new global financial and economic crisis. Furthermore, Regulation (EU) No 1309/2013 was amended to introduce rules allowing the EGF to exceptionally cover collective applications involving small and medium-sized enterprises located in one region and operating in different economic sectors defined at NACE Revision 2 division 5 level, where the applicant Member State demonstrates that small and medium-sized enterprises are the main or the only type of business in that region.  (4) Regulation (EU) 2021/691 of the European Parliament and of the Council established the EGF for the period of the multiannual financial framework from 1 January 2021-31 December 2027. In order to make the EGF more responsive to the rapidly changing economic challenges in a globalised economy, the scope of the EGF was broadened again to cover any type of large-scale restructuring event, no matter what the cause. A lower threshold better reflects the realities in lesser populated regions. In the light of the twin digital and green transitions, measures that prepare beneficiaries for the twin transition were considered mandatory elements of every coordinated package of personalised measures offered to beneficiaries. Further, the co-financing rates were aligned with the highest co-financing rate of the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+) established by Regulation (EU) 2021/1057 of the European Parliament and of the Council 6 in the respective Member State. Ad d itionally , a mandatory beneficiary survey was introduced .  (5) The main Union instrument to assist those workers that have been affected is the ESF+, which is designed to offer assistance in an anticipatory way . T he EGF is also designed to offer assistance in response to major restructuring events. However, this set-up does not properly reflect the fact that large-scale restructuring events generally take place over a long time period . Member States can use the ESF+ to upskill and reskill workers, but the ESF+ does not provide support for the upskilling and reskilling of workers in emergency situations such as those in which workers affected by imminent job displacement are . T he enterprises where the workers concerned are employed are often in economic difficulty and therefore unable to offer such assistance on their own .  (6) The EGF ’s role continues to be important as a flexible instrument to support workers who lose their jobs in large-scale restructuring events and to help them to find other jobs as quickly as possible. The Union should continue to provide specific, one-off support to facilitate the reintegration into decent and sustainable employment of displaced workers in areas, sectors, territories or labour markets suffering from a shock caused by serious economic disruption. The EU has to ensure its sustainable prosperity and competitiveness while preserving its unique social market economy, succeeding in the twin transition, and safeguarding its democracy , economic security and geopolitical standing . To safeguard the EU’s future as an economic powerhouse, and progress on its twin digital and green transition, it is vital to support workers affected by imminent job displacement in ent e rprises undergoing restructuring so that they can acquir e the skills that would help them transfer into a different role, or to change job.  (7) Therefore it is necessary to amend Regulation (EU) 2021/691 so that the EGF can also offer assistance to workers affected by imminent job displacement in ent e rprises undergoing restructuring . As these workers are still in active employment, their employer may request assistance through the relevant Member States’ authorities. As the EGF is under shared management, it is the Member States’ authorities that can request EGF co-funding upon receipt of a request by an enterprise , provided that the enterprise agrees to provide the national co-funding . Should the financial contribution from the EGF be granted, the Member State concerned should make the funds requested available to the enterprise within two weeks of their receipt. In particular, the enterprise should make available to the Member State all information needed to prepare the final report on the implementation of the relevant financial contribution , not later than six months after the end of the implementation of the assistance. The Commission will prepare a beneficiary survey and the enterprise should share the access to the survey to the workers who participated in the programme .  (8) Given the objective to support workers, the targeted packages supporting workers affected by imminent job displacement have to be designed in a way that excludes any Member State discretion on the eligibility criteria or the selection of beneficiaries. If Member States had discretion as to the use of the EGF resources, in particular as regards the selection of enterprises whose workers would benefit from targeted programmes , EGF resources would be considered as State resources, and therefore should be subject to EU State aid rules.  (9) The support provided to workers affected by imminent job displacement in enterprises undergoing restructuring should take into account existing forms of support available under national measures . Short -time work schemes should not be eligible for EGF support as they do not relate to the displacement of jobs, but to their temporary suspension . If the national measures allow it, the requesting enterprise may subcontract the delivery of the coordinated package of personalised measures, or parts thereof .  (10) The co-financing rate for such measures targeted to workers affected by imminent job displacement in enterprises undergoing restructuring should be equal to the co-financing rate for EGF assistance to displaced workers. Enterp r ises that request EGF support should provide the national co-financing.  (11) The co-financing rate for expenditure incurred by the Member State in relation to applications for EGF support , in cluding the preparation of applications as well as the monitoring and control of the assistance granted, and in relation to information and publicity measures, should be 100%.  (12) As the workers affected by imminent job displacement are still in active employment, only those active labour market policy measures that help them re- or upskill, that give guidance or mentoring, including measures aimed at workers that could envisage starting their own business one day, should be eligible. Therefore, neither allowances, nor start-up grants should be eligible.  (13) Workers affected by imminent job displacement receiving EGF assistance should remain eligible even if their work relationship ends. They should also remain eligible for possible follow-up applications by the respective Member States in support of displaced workers from the same enterprise .  (14) Given the Commission’s increasing tasks in implement ing Regulation (EU) 2021/691 , the Commission should be able to request technical assistance of up to 1.5% of the total annual maximum amount of the EGF. The higher rate is also justified since the EGF’s annual maximum amount was lowered in the context of the multiannual financial framework mid-term revision .  (15) To provide swifter support t o workers affected by imminent job displacement in enterprises undergoing restructuring or workers made redundant and allow them to benefit from Union solidarity in the current context of economic disruptions and rapid changes , there is a need to accelerate the support given to the workers . One way of doing this is by requiring the Commission to request to the European Parliament and the Council to mobilis e the full maximum annual amount at the beginning of each year, if specific conditions are met. The Commission proposal should therefore indicate the circumstances that led the Commission to conclude that the conditions to request full mobilisation of the maximum annual amount , have been met . The Commission proposal should be based on information provided by the Member States at the end of each year. The proposal should include the number of potential applications from each Member State concerned, the sectors of activities concerned, the estimated number of ent e rprises which could request Member States to apply for EGF support, and the estimated number of workers at risk of imminent job displacement or that have been displaced . The identity of the enterprises concerned should not be revealed if the information is not yet publicly known.  (16) Once the full mobilisation of the maximum annual amount is approved by the European Parliament and the Council , the Commission should adopt financing decisions on individual applications and should be required to immediately inform the European Parliament and the Council of the adoption of those decisions. If the full mobilised maximum annual amount is not used by the Commission in a given year, that amount would lapse at the end of the financial year.  (17) The proposed amendments will be fully accommodated with Article 8 of Council Regulation 2020/2093 7 , as well as with point 9 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 16 December 2020 8 .  (18) This Regulation should enter into force as a matter of urgency to swiftly provide support to the workers affected on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union ,  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Article 1  Regulation (EU) 2021/691 is amended as follows:  (1) In Article 1 , paragraph 2 is replaced by the following :  ‘ 2.

FRAMEWORK OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE  1.1. Title of the proposal/initiative  Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) 2021/691 on the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for Displaced Workers and repealing Regulation (EU) No 1309/2013  1.2. Policy area concerned  Employment (Competitiveness and Social Fairness)  1.3. Objectives  1.3.1. General objectives  The EGF is a flexible instrument that allows the EU respond to unexpected events. Since its establishment in 2007, the EGF helps workers that have lost their jobs as a result of economic disruptions.  Under the EGF, the EU provides specific, one-off support in the form of active labour market policy measures to facilitate the reintegration into decent and sustainable employment. This support complements the more anticipatory assistance offered by ESF+.  This proposal aims to extend this assistance to workers affected by imminent job displacement as the consequence of a collective redundancy procedure.  It also aims to streamline and speed-up the mobilisation procedure.  1.3.2. Specific objectives  Specific objective No  (1) The EGF’s objective is to support workers who have been made redundant in major restructuring events that, by their scale and effects, cause a significant impact and to facilitate workers’ reintegration into decent and sustainable employment. Th is proposal will add the objective to also provide assistance to workers who are affected by redundancy in an enterprise under g oing restructuring, to be better prepared to complete a job transition in a shorter time, and to facilitate their transfer into a new role or career.  (2) The EGF’s assistance must be made available more swiftly .  1.3.3. Expected result and impact  Specify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.  Allow a fast and sustainable transition into decent new jobs.  1.3.4. Indicators of performance  Specify the indicators for monitoring progress and achievements.  Indicator 1: Total EGF beneficiaries in a given case  Indicator 2: Beneficiaries by gender (female/male/non-binary)  Indicator 3: Beneficiaries by age group (below 30 years/above 54 years)  Indicator 4: Beneficiaries by education level (with lower secondary education or less/with upper secondary or post-secondary education/ with tertiary education)  Indicator 5: Percentage of EGF beneficiaries in education or training  Indicator 6: Beneficiaries by employment status (unemployed/inactive/employed (dependent)/self-employed).  The indicators do not set a baseline, targets or milestones. The number of targeted beneficiaries as specified by the Member State concerned is not considered a baseline. The reason for this is that some Member States target only workers who have been made redundant and have little chance of successfully moving jobs without tailored support, while other Member States target all workers who have been made redundant.  1.4. The proposal/initiative relates to:   a new action   a new action following a pilot project / preparatory action 9   the extension of an existing action  ⌧ a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action  1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative  1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative  This proposal will enable the EGF to respond to large-scale restructuring events by helping workers who immediately lose their jobs. It will also offer anticipatory help to those who are affected by imminent redundancy.  1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, greater effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this section ’ added value of EU involvement ’ is the value resulting from EU action, that is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.  Reasons for action at EU level  EU involvement through the EGF makes it possible to complement national (both public and private) measures to reintegrate workers who have been made redundant or will be made redundant due to major restructuring events. Experience so far shows that EU involvement makes it possible to provide more tailor-made support for a longer period of time, often involving measures that would not have been provided without EU involvement.  Expected generated EU added value ( ex post )  Attaining a higher reintegration rate of displaced workers than the rate achieved through national support generates volume effects. This means that funding has not only increased the number and variety of services offered, but also the level of intensity of those services.  Improving the public’s perception of the EU.  1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past  See the experience gained under Regulation (EU) 2021/691 as set out in the Explanatory Memorandum of the Proposal for a Regulation.  1.5.4. Compatibility with the multiannual financial framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments  EGF support complements the more anticipatory assistance offered by ESF+.  1.5.5. Assessment of the different available financing options, including scope for redeployment  The impact assessment’s key finding (SWD/2018/289 final) is that as an emergency relief fund, the EGF should remain outside the budgetary ceilings of the EU budget.  1.6. Duration of the proposal/initiative and of its financial impact  ⌧ limited duration  – I n effect until the expiry of Regulation (EU)2021/691   unlimited duration  – Implementation with a start-up period from YYYY to YYYY,  – followed by full-scale operation.  1.7. Method(s) of budget implementation planned 10   Direct management by the Commission  –  by its departments, including by its staff in the E U delegations;  –  by the executive agencies  ⌧ Shared management with the Member States   Indirect management by entrusting budget implementation tasks to:  –  third countries or the bodies they have designated  –  international organisations and their agencies (to be specified)  –  the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund  –  bodies referred to in Articles 70 and 71 of the Financial Regulation  –  public law bodies  –  bodies governed by private law with a public service mission to the extent that they are provided with adequate financial guarantees  –  bodies governed by the private law of a Member State that are entrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership and that are provided with adequate financial guarantees  –  bodies or persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in the common foreign and security policy pursuant to Title V of the Treaty on European Union, and identified in the relevant basic act  –  bodies established in a Member State, governed by the private law of a Member State or E U law and eligible to be entrusted, in accordance with sector-specific rules, with the implementation of E U funds or budgetary guarantees, to the extent that such bodies are controlled by public law bodies or by bodies governed by private law with a public service mission, and are provided with adequate financial guarantees in the form of joint and several liability by the controlling bodies or equivalent financial guarantees and which may be, for each action, limited to the maximum amount of the E U support.  2. MANAGEMENT MEASURES  2.1. Monitoring and reporting rules  Article 21 of Regulation (EU) 2021/691 requires the Commission to present, every two years, to the European Parliament and the Council a quantitative and qualitative report on the activities carried out under this Regulation. The report focuses on the results achieved by the EGF and in particular contains information on the applications submitted, processing time, decisions adopted, measures funded, including statistics on the indicators set out in Annex II to Regulation (EU) 2021/691, and the complementarity of such measures with measures funded by other Union funds, in particular ESF+, and information relating to the winding-up of financial contributions made.  In line with Article 22 of Regulation (EU) 2021/691, the Commission, in close cooperation with the Member States, will carry out a mid-term evaluation by 30 June 2025 and an evaluation by 31 December 2029. The evaluation will set out recommendations that must be taken into account when designing new programmes in employment and social affairs or the further development of existing programmes.  2.2. Management and control system(s)  2.2.1. Justification of the budget implementation method(s), the funding implementation mechanism(s), the payment modalities and the control strategy proposed  The requirements that apply to management and financial control are laid down in Article 23 of Regulation (EU) 2021/691.  EGF is under shared management. Experience has shown that a tailor-made package of personalised services needs to be designed by the authority closest to the individual concerned. Depending on the Member State and the type of restructuring event, this would usually be a local, regional or national authority. The implementation tasks are therefore delegated to the Member State authorities. The assistance to workers affected by redundancy will further require the involvement of the enterprise undergoing restructuring. EU intervention is needed due to the scale of the impact of the redundancies, but in line with the subsidiarity principle it is limited to what is necessary to meet the objectives of showing EU solidarity with displaced workers.  Given its purpose, which is to provide support in situations of urgency either in an anticipatory or reactive manner, the EGF remains a flexible instrument falling outside the budgetary ceilings of the EU budget.  The mobilisation mechanism is laid down in Article 15 of Regulation (EU) 2021/691. The Commission must pay the financial contribution to the Member State concerned in a single 100% pre-financing payment.  2.2.2. Information concerning the risks identified and the internal control system(s) set up to mitigate them  The risks are those related to shared management of Community Funds. The requirements applicable to management and financial control are laid down in Article 23 of Regulation (EU) 2021/691.  2.2.3. Estimation and justification of the cost-effectiveness of the controls (ratio between the control costs and the value of the related funds managed), and assessment of the expected levels of risk of error (at payment & at closure)  In terms of expected error rate(s), the aim is to maintain an error rate below the threshold of 2%.  2.3. Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities  Member States should prevent, detect and deal effectively with any irregularities, including fraud, committed by beneficiaries. Moreover, in line with Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Council Regulations (EC, Euratom) No 2988/95 and (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) has the power to carry out administrative investigations, including on-the-spot checks and inspections, in order to establish whether there has been fraud, corruption or any other illegal activity affecting the EU’s financial interests.  The European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) is empowered, in line with Council Regulation (EU) 2017/1939, to investigate and prosecute criminal offences affecting the EU’s financial interests as provided for in Directive (EU) 2017/1371 of the European Parliament and of the Council Member States should take the necessary measures to ensure that any person or entity receiving EU funds fully cooperates to protect the EU’s financial interests, grants the necessary rights and access to the Commission, OLAF, the Court of Auditors and, in respect of Member States participating in enhanced cooperation under Regulation (EU) 2017/1939, the EPPO, and ensures that any third parties involved in the implementation of EU funds grant equivalent rights. Member States must report to the Commission any irregularities detected, including fraud, and any follow-up action they have taken in connection with such irregularities and any OLAF investigations. Member States must cooperate with the Commission, OLAF, the Court of Auditors and the EPPO, in line with point (d) of Article 63(2) of the Financial Regulation on all matters related to suspected or established fraud.  3.

Traditionally, the EGF has assisted workers who have already lost their jobs, but this proposal aims to provide early support to those at risk of redundancy. This proactive approach is designed to mitigate the impact of job losses by offering personalized support packages, including education and retraining, to help affected workers transition to new roles or jobs.

The proposal is driven by the need to address economic disruptions, such as those caused by structural shifts in the economy and global challenges, which have led to a rise in job cuts. While the EU has seen significant employment growth in recent years, recent data indicates a reversal, with job cuts surpassing job creations. The EGF, as an emergency response tool, is intended to fill the gap left by longer-term support mechanisms like the European Social Fund Plus, which cannot be quickly reprogrammed to address immediate needs.

To facilitate this support, the proposal includes a streamlined procedure for mobilizing the EGF's full annual budget at the start of each year, allowing for rapid deployment of resources to affected workers. This approach underscores the EGF's role as a reactive instrument to support workers during economic transitions, ensuring they have access to necessary skills and opportunities to maintain employment and contribute to the EU's economic competitiveness.

The proposal does not include co-financing by third parties, meaning the financial responsibility",

CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  Recent years have witnessed a rise in drug-related violence and criminal activity amongst EU Member States, with illicit drugs like cocaine, heroin, opioids, and amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) posing serious health and security problems. Moreover, the drug market is increasingly marked by the widespread availability of a broader range of drugs, often with higher potency or purity, and in new forms 1 (1) , aided by drug precursors. Drug precursors are chemicals necessary for the illicit production of drugs. However, they can also have significant legitimate use.  In recognition of the need to maintain controls to prevent the diversion of drug precursors towards illicit trade, the UN Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs 2 (2) obliges its Parties to take measures to prevent the diversion of substances frequently used in the illicit manufacture of drugs.  The Union concluded the UN Convention in 1990 3 (3) , and subsequently adopted rules on drug precursors. Currently, the UN Convention is implemented by Regulation (EC) No 273/2004 (‘the Internal Market Regulation’) 4 (4) on monitoring and control ling drug precursors for their possession and placing on the market, and Regulation (EC) No 111/2005 (‘the External Trade Regulation’) 5 (5) , for their trade between the Union and third countries.  These two regulations classify drug precursors as either scheduled (listed and controlled in the regulations) or non-scheduled (for which there are no legally binding obligations). Scheduled drug precursors are classified into several categories 6 (6) depending on their role in illicit drug production and the existing legitimate trade, and thus varying degrees of controls. In addition, in 2013 the provisions granting powers to competent authorities were clarified regarding the possibility to take national measures to control suspicious transactions of non-scheduled drug precursors.  However, the situation has evolved since the adoption of these two regulations, with the rapid increase in designer precursors – drug precursors without any known legitimate use, except research and innovation. Equally, the obligations 7 (7) set out in the regulations create administrative burden across the four categories of scheduled substances. Enforcement measures need to be strengthened in order to ensure the uniform implementation of rules across the EU.  From a security perspective, the proliferation and trafficking of designer precursors present significant challenges to drug precursor control at global level. In response, both the United Nations Commission of Narcotic Drugs (CND) 8 (8) and the International Narcotics Control Board in its 2024 report recommend controlling chemicals that are closely related to controlled precursors – such as families or derivatives of controlled precursors.  In alignment with this strategy, countries like the USA, Canada, Argentina, Mexico and recently China introduced extended scheduling to families or derivatives of controlled precursors. This proactive approach is being followed at multilateral level through the CND 9 (9) . Drug precursor controls are a crucial component of drug supply reduction policy as outlined in the EU Drugs Strategy 2021-2025 10 (10) . The EU Drugs Action Plan 2021-2025 11 (11) further highlights the need to address the challenge posed by designer precursors. Additionally, the 2023 EU Roadmap to fight drug trafficking and organised crime 12 (12) stresses the need to set out innovative ways to speed up and broaden the current approach to regulating drug precursors in response to new methods of illicit drug production.  Protect EU: a European Internal Security Strategy 13 (13) announced a new EU Drugs Strategy and an EU Action Plan against drug trafficking to disrupt routes and business models. The 2025 Commission Work Programme, under its security heading, announced the proposal of new rules governing drug precursors 14 (14) .  Drug precursors are chemicals with an essential role in industries such as pharmaceuticals, flavouring and fragrance, batteries, cosmetics, textiles, oil refinery, water treatment, food additives, explosives, rubber production, fertilisers, plastics or dyes. 15 (15) Within the EU, there were approximately 4 000 active licenses or registrations to trade in drug precursors in 2023 16 (16) . 92 % of these companies are small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) 17 (17) .  Supply chains for these chemicals involve a diverse range of actors, including large-scale chemical manufacturers who produce these substances in bulk for industrial use, as well as specialised producers who create more refined or custom chemical products tailored to specific industrial and research needs. Distributors and other logistics providers play key roles in ensuring that these substances are transported and stored safely. The Union chemical industry is a strategic sector, with 56 % of chemicals going to other sectors. It is therefore vital to simplify conditions to ensure that the legitimate industry is able to fully reap the benefits of the Single Market.  The proposal thus aims to address the challenge of preventing the use of drug precursors in the illicit manufacture of drugs, whilst simplifying rules and procedures for legitimate trade. More specifically, the introduction of specific rules on designer precursors and innovative means for their inclusion will allow quicker action to prevent their diversion. Through digitalisation, several obligations could be automated, leading to a significant reduction in the costs and the administrative burden for operators and the Member State national authorities.  The proposal would contribute towards the objectives set out in political guidelines of the Commission for 2024-2029, which announce the facilitation of business operations, particularly for SMEs 18 (18) , and aim to deepen the Single Market. The Competitiveness Compass emphasizes simplification as a key factor in boosting industry competitiveness. 19 (19)  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  The merging of currently separate instruments for EU internal and external trade will enhance legal clarity and consistency:  • The obligations under the two regulations have been simplified or automated, in line with the digital agenda. This will help reduce the administrative burden for operators and Member State authorities. In addition, a new category has been introduced for designer precursors.  • The inclusion of special rules for designer precursors in the proposal allows for the more effective monitoring and prevention of the proliferation of drug precursors towards illicit aims. Streamlined administrative procedures and a central electronic system will enable greater simplification and reduce overall burden for authorities and business alike, offsetting enforcement and due diligence costs, thereby resulting in a net cost saving. In addition, the drug precursors information repository will provide the necessary guidance to stakeholders.  • Merging the two existing regulations will enable the application of the same rules for internal and external trade, wherever possible.  • Consistency with other Union policies  The proposal is consistent with other Union policies and legislation, namely:  • Regarding illicit drug trafficking, the drug precursors regulations help determine the material scope of minimum national rules on criminal acts concerning precursors set out by Member States in accordance with Council Framework Decision 2004/757/JHA 20 (20) . The EU Drugs Agency (EUDA) plays an important role with its new mandate 21 (21) in the field of drug precursors, and the proposal duly acknowledges its expertise.  • The proposal does not interfere with other rules on chemicals such as the REACH Regulation 22 (22) or the CLP Regulation 23 (23) , or other sectoral chemical legislation such as the Cosmetic Products Regulation 24 (24) or the Detergents Regulation 25 (25) .  • Furthermore, with respect to customs policy, this initiative supports the EU Customs Reform 26 (26) which aims to establish a new EU Customs Authority maintaining an EU Customs Data Hub. The Data Hub will replace the current fragmented customs IT infrastructure in EU Member States, enhancing interoperability with related policy areas. Data on drug precursors will be integrated into the Data Hub.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  The proposal is based on Articles 33, 114 and 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  The Union has shared competence in setting out rules on the control and monitoring of drug precursors within the internal market. The EU set out harmonisation rules on drug precursors since 1990. Two key arguments continue to justify EU action in this field. Firstly, illicit drug production is a Union-wide problem, not confined to a few Member States. EU action is needed to ensure that the efficiency of controls of drug precursors across the Union is not diminished by the existence of diverse national rules with various degrees of strictness, which would inadvertently lead to weaknesses. Secondly, Member States have the obligation to control and monitor transactions with drug precursors, in accordance with the UN Convention. Maintaining harmonised rules would ensure a smooth legitimate trade of chemicals in the single market. EU action would have clear benefits for businesses, national authorities and society as a whole, by empowering national authorities to better fight against illicit drug production, ensuring the good functioning of the internal market and reducing administrative burdens for economic operators and national authorities.  • Proportionality  The proposal does not exceed what is necessary for reaching the objectives pursued. The measures concern a limited number of precursors, thus targeting the controls without unduly hampering legal trade and innovation. The proposal reflects the risks associated with each category of precursors and takes full advantage of digitalisation. It strikes a fair balance between the need to reduce the availability of drug precursors for the illicit manufacture of drugs, and the need to facilitate legitimate trade. Thus, despite a reduction of administrative processes notably on bulk materials with significant legitimate use, the diversion risk is properly addressed by strengthening the enforcement.  • Choice of the instrument  The rules on controls and monitoring of drug precursors are to be set out in a Regulation, and thus directly applicable in all Member States. Drug precursors are often part of supply chains with operators in more than one Member State. The existence of uniform rules will ensure a level playing field among economic operators.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  The 2020 report from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on the evaluation of the EU drug precursor regulations 27 (27) reveals a number of shortcomings that have emerged since the adoption of the Internal market and External Trade regulations, along with possible measures to address them. Notably:  • It underlines the need for action specifically targeting designer precursors. The current rules concern drug precursors where there is evidence of legitimate trade. Also, the current scheduling mechanism, based on a substance-by-substance approach, is too slow in keeping up with the fast pace of innovation by illicit drug manufacturers. There are hardly any limitations to the innovations of the producers of designer-precursors. In other words, each time a new substance is scheduled the criminals will be able to ‘tweak some molecules’ and come up with a new designer-precursor. The time needed for this can be short and in any case is often shorter than the period needed to schedule a new substance.  • Equally, the evaluation also underscores the administrative burden on operators and competent authorities, and the potential digitalisation offers in this regard, such as through e-licencing and the automatic validation through the European Union Single Window Environment for Customs 28 (28) . Further examples of possible reduction of the administrative burden identified a facilitation of trade in low quantities of scheduled drug precursors and the elimination of certain wait periods related to pre-export notifications for external trade.  • Moreover, consideration for the role of online marketplaces in the possible diversion and trafficking of drug precursors would help maintain the relevance of the regulations in the foreseeable future. In addition, the evaluation recommends strengthening the catch-all clause to allow more effective enforcement.  • Stakeholder consultations  The Commission carried out a number of consultation activities to collect evidence and views from a broad range of stakeholders on the problems identified with the Drug Precursors Regulations. Activities included (i) a twelve-week dedicated public consultation concluded in July 2024; (ii) two stakeholder workshops held on 14 November 2023 and 19 September 2024; (iii) discussions with Member States and other stakeholders in the Expert Group on Drug Precursors; and (iv) feedback collected in response to the Commission’s Call for Evidence. As part of the impact assessment study, an external contractor also organised interviews with 78 relevant stakeholders, and two targeted surveys of national authorities and economic operators ran from 25 March to 17 May 2024 and 18 April to 14 June 2024 respectively. Consulted stakeholders included industry associations, economic operators, citizens, and national authorities. Most responses came from a business environment or from national authorities.  National authorities supported strengthening measures to prevent the diversion of drug precursors and, in particular, measures concerning the proliferation of designer precursors. They supported a moderate scope for a ban that would still enable legitimate activities such as research. They noted that this may lead to a higher implementation burden. Economic operators also supported measures in this field but stressed the need for a clear and univocal identification of banned substances (ideally through CAS number or other machine-readable coding) as a prerequisite to avoid undue increase of due diligence costs for legitimate trade. While the consultation activities gave mixed results on current administrative burdens, many stakeholders believed that transitioning to a fully digitalised system would significantly reduce administrative burdens by streamlining processes, improving accuracy, and enabling real-time access to necessary data.  • Collection and use of expertise  Evidence supporting this initiative was gathered from existing documentary sources including legislation and other policy documents, customs and trade statistics, evaluations and reports on relevant policies and information on related initiatives, as listed in Annex 6 to the impact assessment.  • Impact assessment  The Commission carried out an impact assessment on the revision of the Drug Precursor Regulations. The Regulatory Scrutiny Board issued a positive opinion on the draft impact assessment on 6 June 2025. The impact assessment report was revised to take into account the Board’s comments, in particular by better explaining how the uneven implementation and enforcement among Member States is a driving factor behind the problem; the extent to which the existing burdens pose a problem for economic operators and public authorities and why removing some measures would not increase the risks; why the two comprehensive review options are considered to be equally effective in reducing illicit trade and manufacturing; the evidence and methodology used to support the estimates of social impacts; and the key indicators to measure success.  The opinion of the Board as well as the final impact assessment and its executive summary are published together with this proposal. Based on the available information, the impact assessment examined and compared three policy options to address each of the two main problems identified. These policy options were in addition to the baseline option of no change, which would still allow for the inclusion of designer precursors in the scope of the current rules.  Policy option 1:  Policy option 1 aims at assessing the extent to which the current empowerments would be an effective and efficient means to meet the policy objectives of the initiative. The key measures of option 1 that would be underpinned by guidance and transparency measures involving the drug precursors information repository are the following:  • Specific rules for designer precursors in internal trade. Designer precursors rarely enter legitimate supply chains. Yet, their legitimate use in research and innovation, often in very small quantities, needs to remain possible. This is why for internal trade the obligations attached to designer precursors are rendered more targeted. Legitimate use is notified to the competent authority who may then investigate further.  • Simplify reporting obligations by switching from an ex-post to an ex-ante for internal trade: In line with the idea of maintaining high levels of control while streamlining the administrative requirements linked to the controls, this option also seeks to facilitate reporting for economic operators and authorities.  Policy option 2:  Policy option 2 makes use of the wider possibilities provided by a full legislative revision. This enables, notably, a better alignment of external and internal trade controls. The idea of policy option 2 is to gauge to what extent controls of drug precursors trade can be streamlined without compromising their effectiveness. The key measures of option 2 are the following:  • Streamlining and reorganisation of the existing categories of substances: The new set of categories therefore aim to clarify and streamline obligations and controls based on an updated perception of the risk-profile of a group of substances.  • Introducing a new category for designer precursors with an a priori ban: Designer precursors are different from traditional designer precursors in that their legal use is often limited to research activities, but other future legitimate uses cannot be excluded a priori. Use or transactions of such precursors in small quantities for research and innovation should be subject to a prior notification to national authorities, while transactions and use in larger quantities is to be subject to a licence.  • Innovative and more forward-looking ways of scheduling: Option 2 would adapt the rules to the inclusion of groups of substances, for instance based on a chemical base molecule and a limited number of precise modifications to these base molecules.  Policy option 3:  Option 3 is also based on a full legislative revision. Its basic structure is shared with option 2 but it is rather based on the premise of maximising controls. Its key measures are the following:  • Streamlining existing categories of substances and increasing control measures applicable to them: While option 3 also entails a streamlining of categories, the focus is on increasing controls. The aim of extending controls is to have a better overview of legal trade in all precursor substances. This should enable authorities to monitor trade more closely.  • Introducing a new category for designer precursors with a greater focus on ex-ante controls by requiring special licences in all cases.  • Broader approach to innovative scheduling: Option 3 would imply including group of substances with base molecules (represented by their structural formula) and allow for an extended number of modifications to these, resulting in a larger number of substances to be scheduled.  Comparison of the options:  Option 1, while reducing time for scheduling and facilitating knowledge, was expected to fall short of expectations in terms of addressing the proliferation of designer precursors and related social impacts. It was considered to lead to limited burden reduction for internal trade only and have marginal environmental impacts.  Option 3 was expected to largely deliver the same results as Option 2. It was expected to maximise the reduction in the availability of precursors used in the manufacturing of illicit drugs. Given that it would be more costly to enforce due to the larger number of substances to be screened and higher control burdens on legitimate businesses, some Member States did not support excessively broad scheduling of substances as they may not be in the position to cope with the required effort.  Preferred policy option  Policy option 2 is the preferred option 2 as it was considered to be most effective against the proliferation of designer precursors and the trafficking of non-scheduled substances.  In terms of economic impacts, this option and especially the larger scope of substances scheduled as designer precursors is expected to come with an increase of about 10% in enforcement costs. Economic operators would face a one-off cost of about EUR M 7.7 for ensuring that newly scheduled designer precursors are not included in their portfolio. of the measures on designer precursors are offset by the streamlining and simplification of the regulatory framework. Yet, the development of an electronic system provides for the modernisation of the control system, alongside the provisions for digital verification of customers in the internal trade of Category 1 and Category 3 drug precursors. The burden of the EU control system for legal trade is reduced through the lifting/automation of various requirements. Overall, the streamlining and digitalisation of procedures is expected to lead to an administrative burden reduction of EUR M 25.27 per year. These changes should contribute to effectively facilitating trade and promoting the competitiveness of the sector.  For social impacts, the real-time reporting of significant seizures and urgency procedure will reduce significantly the time to detect and respond to new threats, while enabling authorities to target controls more specifically on those substances that are at a higher risk of being used in illegal drug production. Overall, this is expected to help reduce the availability of precursors used in the manufacturing of illicit drugs (especially synthetic drugs). Economic operators’ awareness, and engagement will improve. Indirectly, the initiative should therefore reduce the availability of illicit drugs and may thus contribute to a reduction of social costs caused by illicit drug trafficking and consumption.  No direct environmental effects are expected but an overall reduction of illicit drug production may reduce illegal waste disposal from drug productions sites.  This option is also expected to contribute to the achievement of three of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): SDG #9 ‘Industry, innovation’; SDG #3 ‘Good health and well-being and infrastructure’ and SDG #16 ‘Peace, justice, and strong institutions’.  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  The initiative has a strong simplification dimension. Namely, through:  • A merger of the two regulations into a single regulation, aligning rules for both the internal market and external trade wherever possible.  • Fewer categories of scheduled drug precursors, from 4 to 3. Introducing a specific category for designer precursors provides greater clarity to operators and national authorities alike that such substances are subject to an outright ban. In addition, the initiative includes an exemption to this ban for small quantities for research and innovation. In case a legitimate use for a Category 3 drug precursor is discovered, the Commission and Member States will assess if such a substance should be placed in another category or exempt from the scope of the regulation.  • Due to the risk of diversion, the proposal does not exempt micro enterprises. However, where reasonable the proposal foresees exemptions for small quantities and for pharmacies and veterinary dispensaries .  • From a digital perspective, the development of a central electronic system allows for several improvements:  • Digital applications for licences (new Categories 1 and 3) and registration for external trade (new Category 2).  • Digital controls for imports and exports by the EU Single Window Environment for Customs and the lifting of the Pre-Export Notification (PEN) waiting period.  • Reporting obligations are automated by aggregating the data entered into the central electronic syst e m . The process of verifying customers will be digitalised.  The above should lead to reduced administrative costs for operators and public authorities. The benefits accruing from the consolidation of the two regulations are difficult to quantify since they relate to the time spent understanding the rules and how to comply with them (i.e. they are a complementary action for the compliance with the actual obligations themselves).  The initiative will reduce obligations for certain substances to better facilitate trade (such as in the removal of administrative costs related to the reporting requirement). It will also extend obligations to support enhanced control (i.e., due diligence costs for the implementation of the ban on designer precursors. Globally there will be a net reduction in costs, with the impact assessment estimating this net cost saving as amounting to approximately EUR 25,27 million per year.  • Fundamental rights  The proposal complies with the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. The freedom to conduct business set out in the charter is not absolute. The restrictions set out in this proposal such as requesting a licence for performing activities involving Category 1 or Category 3 drug precursors are justified by the need to monitor activities with such precursors and reduce their availability for the illicit manufacture of drugs. This objective is in line with the general objective of providing a high level of human health protection in the definition and implementation of all the Union's policies.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  Member States and operators will rely on a centralised electronic system that will streamline and support the process for managing licences, registrations, customer verifications, quantity management, and prior notifications. The new rules will eventually remove the periodic reporting obligations for operators and authorities.  Comprehensive digital solutions are expected to facilitate the completion of administrative tasks for operators and to expedite the overall process. Moreover, it will enable competent authorities to verify the legality of drug precursors movements more effectively, improving traceability.  Digitalisation will enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of controls, providing authorities with faster access to structured, high-quality information that allows for automatic checks of licences/registrations and perform quantity management. This will support faster clearance times for imports and exports while strengthening the EU’s ability to detect and prevent illicit trade.  • To achieve this, budgetary needs for the internal market IT system and human resources are estimated to amount to EUR M 1.3 22 , starting from 2028.  • For external trade, a preliminary analysis led to a budget requirements estimation of up to EUR M 24.148 , including human resources, depending on the IT solution delivery model chosen.  • An information repository of drug precursors which will cover all relevant scheduled and non-scheduled substances having or not a known industrial or commercial use which will , including human resources, cost approximately EUR 0.5 30 M.  Further information on these costs can be found in Section 3.2 of the Legislative Financial Digital Statement. The post-2027 figures are indicative, without pre-empting and pre-judging the Commission proposal and the agreement on the next MFF.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  The Commission will evaluate the Regulation 10 years after its entry into application with a view to assessing its effectiveness, efficiency, relevance, added value and coherence. The Commission will submit a report on the main findings to the European Parliament and to the Council.  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  Article 1 defines the subject matter of the Regulation, which is to set out rules for monitoring and controlling drug precursors both for activities in the internal market and for external trade.  Article 2 defines the most important notions used in the Regulation, using whenever possible cross-references from other related Union acts to ensure consistency.  Article 3 defines the material scope of the rules. Drug precursors are to be understood as referring to substances, mixtures, organisms and substances which occur in nature which can be used in the illicit production of drugs. While both scheduled and non-scheduled drug precursors are covered, there are specific conditions in which certain mixtures are excluded from the scope. In addition, the activities of public authorities, such as armed forces or police, acting within the scope of their official duties, as well as the use or possession of drug precursors by pharmacies and veterinary dispensaries are also excluded from the scope, due to the low risk of diversion. Furthermore, while making available on the market, use and possession of medicinal products or veterinary medicinal products are excluded from the scope of the Regulation, external trade is covered only for those products included in Part II of Annex II to the Regulation.  Article 4 includes the standard free movement clause, which will ensure that Member States will not impede making available on the market scheduled drug precursors, if the requirements in the Regulation are fulfilled, by imposing additional monitoring measures, for instance.  Article 5 lists the 3 categories of scheduled drug precursors and sets out the conflict rules to be used to determine the requirements in specific cases where either a substance belongs to two categories, or a mixture contains substances belonging to two or three categories.  Articles 6 to 8 set out the general obligations applicable to operators trading with scheduled drug precursors. Operators have a general obligation of cooperation with national authorities and to keep documentation on their transactions with scheduled drug precursors. To support national authorities in fighting the illicit manufacture of drugs, operators and providers of online marketplaces have the obligation to notify suspicious transactions and significant disappearances or thefts of scheduled drug precursors.  Articles 9 to 14 lay down the requirements for placing on the market, use, possession, import, export or intermediary activities with Category 1 drug precursors. These are the drug precursors with legitimate uses in the chemical industry with the highest risk of diversion. Therefore, they are subject to strict control measures. In addition to the requirement to hold a licence, the operators have to designate a responsible officer, secure premises and trade in the internal market only with operators also holding a licence. Equally, operators using or possessing Category 1 drug precursors also have to keep the documentation, in similar conditions as those for operators trading with any scheduled drug precursor.  Article 15 lays down the requirements for import, export or intermediary activities with Category 2 drug precursors. External traders of Category 2 scheduled drug precursors will no longer need to apply for, and subsequently be granted, a registration for import, export, or intermediary activities. Instead, they will simply register information on their activities, including the estimates of maximum quantities envisaged during a validity period of three years, after which they can start activities involving the scheduled drug precursors they register. This information will be updated as required. Competent authorities may decide to suspend or cease the activities included in the registration in case the conditions declared are no longer fulfilled or in case of suspicion of risk of diversion towards illicit purposes.  Articles 16 to 19 set out the requirements for the newly introduced Category 3 drug precursors concerning designer precursors. Category 3 drug precursors contain substances which have no known legitimate use other than research or innovation at the moment of placing them under control. Therefore, the trade, use or possession of such substances should, a priori , be banned. Transactions, use or possession of small quantities for research and innovation should be allowed subject to a prior notification. If needed in larger quantities or for other legitimate uses, a licence is to be requested.  Articles 20 to 23 lay down procedures related to external trade in drug precursors. The new rules enable the simplification of external trade procedures through automation. Articles 20 and 22 set out the requirements for import and export authorisations, which are replaced by a system of quantity management, whereby the operator notifies the competent authority of the maximum quantity of scheduled substances to be imported or exported over a specific time period. This would also cover one or more intended import or export activities during this time up to a ceiling of the total quantity originally indicated. Article 23 sets out the provision for customs verification, whereby the central electronic system will connect to the Single Window Environment for customs to verify the information provided on intended imports or exports against the operator’s licence, registration, or prior notification details.  Article 21 sets out the process for pre-export notifications, which has been further streamlined. The pre-export notification obligation has been waived for countries in the European Economic Area (EEA). In addition, the 15-day wait period provided to third countries to reply to such a pre-export notification has been lifted.  Article 24 maintains the current provisions that external traders will continue to have the obligation to demonstrate the licit purpose when the scheduled drug precursors are transhipped, placed in temporary storage, or stored in a free zone.  Article 25 sets out a Drug Precursors Information Repository, which is to replace the existing Voluntary Monitoring List. The Repository is to contain information on the scheduled and non-scheduled drug precursors. It has several purposes: to support the operators in identifying suspicious transactions and in determining if specific substances are within the scope of the Regulation in case of including groups of substances identified in a generic way, and to support the Commission and national authorities in identifying the need to place new substances under control. The Repository is to be developed and maintained by the European Union Drugs Agency.  As additional measures to raise awareness and support Member States in the fight against the illicit manufacture of drugs, Article 26 sets out rules on training both for national authorities and operators.  Article 2 7 sets out provisions on mutual assistance between the Member States and between the Member States and the Commission, in particular by recourse to Council Regulation (EC) No 515/97 29 (29) .  Article 28 sets out an obligation for competent authorities to perform controls on the fulfilment of the obligations of this legislation with regard to scheduled drug precursors.  Articles 29 and 30 provide catch-all provisions for drug precursors. Competent authorities are empowered to intervene to avoid diversion towards the illicit production of drugs in the internal market by seizing scheduled drug precursors for a determined period of time in the conditions set out in the national law. For external trade, the powers of customs and competent authorities to monitor and control the possible diversion of both scheduled and non-scheduled precursors are strengthened by enabling Member State competent authorities with the tools to adopt stricter provisions for non-scheduled precursors, such as temporary detention, if they deem necessary. In addition, the requirement of strict control measures for all customs procedures is highlighted.  Article 31 sets out an obligation for Member States to adopt national rules on penalties, to ensure the enforcement of the Regulation.  Article 32 concerns the reporting of information on seizures by competent authorities and customs authorities, while Article 33 sets out specific information obligations for Member States which could lead to future developments as regards substances included in the categories of scheduled drug precursors or in the Repository, as non-scheduled drug precursor.  Article 34 elaborates on the annual reporting obligation to the UN, to be performed by the Commission in consultation with Member States. The existing annual reporting obligations of operators are removed, as automation can provide this information. This allows the reporting obligations as per international obligations to continue with a more sustainable focus of resource utilisation.  Article 35 sets out the main functions of a centralised IT system for drug precursors which is to support the implementation of the various obligations. The system should allow operators to fulfil their obligations laid down in this Regulation and competent authorities, to make their decisions on the implementation of this Regulation and perform their reporting obligations. The system should also facilitate the communication by the Commission of information requested under the UN Convention. The centralised system is to be interconnected with the Single Windows Customs system, to enable the application of a quantity management system and thus replace the existing system of import and export authorisations. In addition, the system could be made compatible with the UN system for reporting of precursors incidents, so that the reporting of seizures in the electronic system is not a duplication of the existing reporting obligation under the UN Convention. The Commission is to adopt an implementing act setting out implementation arrangements for the electronic system, including the technical and the procedural requirements that stem from its functions. Article 36 covers the protection of personal data in the context of the operation of the electronic system.  Article 37 sets out the Commission empowerment for technical adaptations to the Annexes to amend the substances placed under control. In addition, the Commission is to amend other non-essential elements regarding, for instance, licences, registrations, prior notifications, quantity notifications for import or export, reporting obligations or transitional measures.  Article 38 describes the conditions for exercising the empowerment to adopt delegated acts.  Article 39 allows the Commission to use the urgency procedure to adopt delegated acts in duly justified cases, for changes to the controlled substances.  Article 40 ensures that the Commission will follow the examination procedure when adopting implementing acts regarding the implementation arrangements for the IT system.  Articles 41 to 45 refer to final and transitional arrangements. The Commission is to review the Regulation after a period of 10 years of application. This will allow the Commission to also consider the application of the quantity management system in the first evaluation of the Regulation, which is an essential element, and which is applicable only at a later stage when the IT system is fully developed. While Regulation (EC) No 273/2004 and Regulation (EC) No 111/2005 are to be repealed, transitional provisions are also proposed to ensure legal clarity as regards documents issued under the old rules. The application of the new rules should be deferred with 3 years to give the Commission time to develop part of the functions of the IT system to support its implementation and the operators and national authorities time to adapt. Since the other functions of the IT system supporting the quantity management for imports and exports will be operational at a later stage, a dedicated Annex sets out the transitional arrangements for the additional period as regards external trade and the reporting of external traders on their annual transactions.  2025/0384 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  on monitoring and controlling drug precursors and repealing Regulations (EC) No 273/2004 and (EC) No 111/2005  (Text with EEA relevance)  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 33, 114 and 207 thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national Parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 30 (1) ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure 31 (2) ,  Whereas:  (1) The United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances adopted in Vienna on 19 December 1988 ('the UN Convention') is part of the worldwide effort to combat the production and trafficking of illicit drugs. The Union concluded the UN Convention by means of Council Decision 90/611/EEC 32 (3) .  (2) Article 12 of the UN Convention requires the Parties thereto to take the measures they deem appropriate t o p reve n t the diversion of substances which are included in the tables annexed t o the Convention a n d u sed for the purpose of the illicit manufacture of drugs (drug precursors) . T he adoption of rules to monitor and control these drug precursors was implemented in the Union by Regulation (EC) No 273/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council 33 (4) , regarding the control and monitoring measures within the internal market; and Council Regulation (EC) No 111/2005 34 (5) on trade between the Union and third countries.  (3) The Evaluation of the Union drug precursor regulations 35 (6) has shown that additional action with regard to designer precursors is necessary. Designer precursors are substances closely related to controlled drug precursors, with no known legitimate use, and which evade the controls set out in Regulations (EC) No 273/2004 and 111/2005. Those Regulations have been conceived to address the diversion of traditional drug precursors from licit channels towards the illicit manufacture of drugs, and do not include specific rules addressing designer precursors. The evaluation also pointed out to the need to take a holistic approach in regulating drug precursors, to ensure consistency with recent policy developments at Union level against drug trafficking . Recent developments include the EU Drugs Strategy and Action Plan , the adoption of Regulation (EU) 2023/1322 36 (7) on the European Union Drugs Agency, the European Digital Strategy and the adoption of Regulation (EU) 2022/2399 37 (8) .  (4) Drug precursor controls are a crucial component of drug supply reduction policy as outlined in the EU Drugs Strategy 2021-2025 38 (9) . Furthermore, the EU Drugs Action Plan 2021-2025 39 (10) highlights the need to address the challenge posed by designer precursors. Additionally, the 2023 EU Roadmap to fight drug trafficking and organised crime 40 (11) stresses the need to set out innovative ways to speed up and broaden the current approach to regulating drug precursors in response to new methods of illicit drug production. Equally, as part of the new EU Drugs Strategy and EU Action Plan against drug trafficking , announced in Protect EU: a European Internal Security Strategy 41 (12) , the EU will boost operational efforts to stop the inflow of drug precursors , including designer precursors . .  (5) Therefore, new rules on drug precursors should be adopted, to better address the developments in the illicit manufacture of drugs, and in particular, the proliferation of designer precursors . These new rules would also give effect to the obligations deriving from Article 12 of the UN Convention.  (6) In order to streamline current procedures and to reduce administrative burden, Regulation (EC) No 273/2004 and Regulation (EC) No 111/ 2005 should also be merged into one Regulation. That should also facilitate the free movement of chemicals in the internal market. This Regulation should apply without prejudice to other Union legislation applicable to the substances contained in drug precursors covered by this Regulation, such as Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 42 (14) , Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 43 (15) or Regulation (EU) 2019/1148 44 (16) . It should also apply without prejudice to the obligations of Member States to set out national rules on the constituent elements of criminal acts and penalties in the field of illicit drug trafficking in accordance with Council Framework Decision 2004/757/JHA 45 (17) . This Regulation should not apply to customs, police, armed forces and laboratories of competent authorities in the Member States when they are acting within the scope of their official duties, as the risk of diversion of drug precursors in such cases is minimal. The possession and use of drug precursors by pharmacies and veterinary dispensaries within the scope of their regular activities should also be exempt from the scope of the Regulation, as such operators are already subject to strict rules under Union and national legislation. The possibility of setting out simplified formalities for specific external traders , such as pharmacies and dispensaries of veterinary products, should be maintained to reduce the administrative burden for operators with a low risk profile.  (7) Scheduled drug precursors consist of or contain substances covered by the annexes to this Regulation. The annexes should include all the substances already covered by Regulation (EC) No 273/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Council Regulation (EC) No 111/2005 . Such substances are either covered by the UN Convention or are placed under control at Union level, in response to specific risks of diversion identified in the Union. To facilitate their free movement in the internal market and their external trade, harmonised rules should be set out to enable national authorities to control and monitor legitimate trade effectively, with a view to avoiding their diversion towards the illicit manufacture of drugs, without creating disproportionate administrative burdens. As is the case under the current rules, operators should continue to have the obligation to notify suspicious transactions. This is an important source of information for competent authorities to discover illicit activities. The obligation should be extended to significant disappearances and thefts, as such incidents could also indicate possible diversion towards the illicit manufacture of drugs. Similarly, operators should maintain their obligation to keep the documentation regarding transactions of scheduled drug precursors. To increase the possibility for competent authorities to gather evidence concerning illicit activities, the obligation to keep documentation should be extended to operators using scheduled drug precursors of the highest risk and the documentation should be kept for a longer period of time.  (8) This Regulation should lay down specific obligations for online marketplaces with respect to reporting suspicious transactions with scheduled drug precursors that take place on their websites or that use their computing services, once they have become aware of information leading to such a suspicion. The obligations on online marketplaces under this Regulation should not amount to a general monitoring obligation.  (9) Category 1 drug precursors should be subject to strict control rules as they contain substances playing a key role in the illicit manufacture of drugs, but also with important legitimate uses which increases the risk of diversion from licit channels. Operators making available on the market, importing, exporting, performing intermediary activities, possessing or using such drug precursors should continue to be required to hold a licence, as this offers national authorities the possibility to make a thorough check of their legitimate intentions before the activity can be performed. Where fees are levied at national level for obtaining a licence, Member States should adjust such fees in order to safeguard the competitiveness of small and medium -sized enterprises within the meaning of Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC 46 (18) . The existing obligation of operators to verify that their customers also hold a licence should be maintained, as it proved to be an efficient way of verifying the reliability of such customers. However, the obligation to obtain customer declarations should no longer be maintained, as it leads to administrative burden without clear benefits in terms of facilitating the identification of suspicious transactions. It is also important to maintain the existing obligation of operators trading in Category 1 drug precursors to secure premises, and to extend it to operators using such drug precursors, given their high risk of diversion.  (10) Category 2 drug precursors are precursors which, even though frequently used in the illicit production of drugs, are traded in significant quantities in the internal market and external trade and have extensive legitimate uses . While the risk of diversion is significant, strict control measures would be very cumbersome both for the industry and for the national authorities, with limited added value for the identification of suspicious activities. Therefore, the control and monitoring measures under this Regulation should be focused only on the external trade. To reduce the administrative burden, obligation s for external trader s should be limited to registering their activities, without the requirement of approval by national authorities.  (11) Category 3 drug precursors should be introduced to address the particularities and high risks for use in illicit drug production associated with designer precursors, which play a significant role in the illicit manufacture of drugs, as demonstrated by their high proportion in the number of seizures in the recent years, and do not have any known legitimate use other than research and innovation. Such precursors do not follow the traditional pattern of diversion from licit channels towards the illicit manufacture of drugs. In support of the fight against the production and trafficking of illicit drugs, it is therefore important to ban them from: being made available on the market; import; export; intermediary activities; and the ir use or possession.  (12) However, as Category 3 drug precursors can be used in research and innovation and other legitimate uses may be discovered after the inclusion of various substances in the annex to this Regulation, it is important to set out rules allowing operators to perform activities with such precursors. Should small quantities of designer precursors be needed for research and innovation, operators should be required to file a prior notification to the competent authority in the Member State where they are established. That will encourage research and innovation by not imposing costly and lengthy formalities for transactions of low quantities and therefore low risk. Should operators need Category 3 drug precursors in higher quantities or for legitimate purposes other than research and innovation, they should then be required to obtain a licence in accordance with the provisions for Category 1 drug precursors, as the risks are similar.  (13) As new designer precursors can be easily created by modifying the chemical structure of substances placed under control, it is important that this Regulation is adapted to cater for the introduction of both a list of substances identified individually and of groups of substances identified in a generic way in Category 3 drug precursors. Whenever a group of substances is included in a generic way, an exemption list should be provided to exclude individual substances that are part of this group but for which a legitimate use other than research and innovation has been identified and which are not included in either Category 1 or Category 2 drug precursors.  (14) The requirement for obtaining import and export authorisations should be removed and replaced by quantity management, comprising quantity notification by operators and automatic verifications by customs authorities for import and export. That should reduce the administrative burden for ex ternal traders , whilst at the same time maintaining strict controls of drug precursors entering or leaving the customs territory of the Union and ensuring continued fulfilment of the UN Convention by the Union and its Members States.  (15) In accordance with Article 12(10) of the UN Convention, the effectiveness and practicability of pre-export notifications is fully recognised. However, exports to non-Member States participating in the Union Single Market and exports to countries where an international agreement waives the pre-export notification, should be exempt from the pre-export notification obligation .  (16) To enforce this Regulation effectively, it is important to enable competent authorities to request proof of licit purposes for drug precursors entering the customs territory of the Union.  (17) It is essential to step up efforts for raising the awareness of legitimate operators to the risks associated with non-scheduled precursors, to support them in identifying suspicious transactions and notifying them on voluntary basis. Thus, extensive information on drug precursors, including non-scheduled ones, and a tool to help determine the scope of scheduled designer precursors, will be made available through a Drug Precursors Information Repository.  (18) The Drug Precursors Information Repository should be developed, maintained , and kept up to date by the European Union Drugs Agency and should replace the existing Voluntary Monitoring List. The Repository should contain comprehensive information on scheduled and non-scheduled drug precursor s , and their legitimate and illicit uses , to support operators in identifying suspicious transactions and Member States and the Commission in identifying new trends in the illicit production of drugs.  (19) Member States should organise regular training to raise awareness on the risks of diversion of drug precursors and the significant role which operators can play in the fight against the illicit manufacture of drugs.  (20) Mutual assistance between Member States and between Member States and the Commission should be reinforced, in particular by recourse to Council Regulation (EC) No 515/97 47 (19) .  (21) To prevent the diversion of drug precursors towards the illicit manufacturing of drugs, national authorities and customs authorities should be empowered to seize and confiscate both scheduled and non-scheduled drug precursors, if there are reasonable grounds or evidence that the drug precursor is intended for illicit use.  (22) To ensure the correct application of this Regulation, Member States should lay down rules on penalties applicable for infringement of this Regulation, which should be effective, dissuasive and proportionate.  (23) The annual reporting obligation for operators should be removed, as it has not been proven to be the most efficient measure in the identification of suspicious activities, while being very burdensome for the industry. Instead, the efforts of national authorities should be increased in reporting, without delay, significant seizures of drug precursors. This would ensure that national authorities from other Member States can better target their controls.  (24) Following the Union’s obligations of reporting in Article 12(12) of the UN Convention and Resolution s of the United Nations Economic and Social Council 1995/20 on measures to strengthen international cooperation to prevent diversion of substances included in table I of the UN Convention and used in the illicit manufacture of stimulants and other psychotropic substances and 49/3 strengthening systems for the control of precursor chemicals used in the manufacture of synthetic drugs, the Commission should draw up an annual report to be sent to the International Narcotics Control Board.  (25) A centralised electronic system should be established to digitalise all the procedures set out in this Regulation. The system s hould allow operators to fulfil their obligations laid down in this Regulation and competent authorities to make their decisions on the implementation of this Regulation and perform their reporting obligations . The system should also facilitate the communication by the Commission of information requested under the UN Convention. The enforcement of drug precursors entering or leaving the Customs territory of the Union under this Regulation should be facilitated by the interconnection between that electronic system and the ‘EU Single Window Environment for Customs’. In addition, the Commission should explore with the United Nations to possibly interconnect the electronic system with the United Nations system for the reporting of incidents with precursors or other tools, to avoid double reporting and facilitate the international cooperation. The A gency should have access to the information in the electronic system to facilitate the implementation of its mandate under Regulation (EU) 2023/1322 and the development and updat e of the Drug Precursors Information Repository.  (26) Any processing of personal data under this Regulation should be carried out in compliance with the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 48 (20) or Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 49 (21) of the European Parliament and of the Council, within their respective scope of application.  (27) In order to amend certain non-essential elements of this Regulation, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission to add or remove substances from the c ategories of drug precursors , where necessary as a matter of urgency . Given the particularities of designer precursors which are close chemical relatives of scheduled drug precursors and can be easily created, the Commission should have the possibility to add designer precursors also by including groups of substances, identified in a generic way and, where needed, to exclude individual substances part of such groups which have legitimate uses other than research and innovation and which are not to be included in a different category. However, the Commission should not add groups of substances in Category 1 or Category 2 drug precursors, unless this is necessary to fulfil the obligations under the UN Convention. In addition, the Commission should be empowered to amend non-essential elements set out in the annexes concerning licences, registration s , prior notification s , quantity management related to import and export, pre-export notification s , demonstration of licit purposes, determining the criteria for suspicion on intention of use in the illicit manufacture of drugs , transitional measures and reporting. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during the preparatory work for the adoption of delegated acts, including at expert level and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making 50 (22) . In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States’ experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.  (28) Implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission in order to determine the implementing arrangements for the electronic system. These arrangements should include technical requirements and procedures for the implementation of the main obligations set out in this Regulation, such as obtaining a licence, filing a registration or prior-notification, or those linked to quantity notification and customs verification. These arrangement s should also include the rules for the protection, safety and security of personal data. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Counci l 51 .  (29) Since the objectives of this Regulation cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the international and changeable nature of the trade in drug precursors, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in third paragraph of Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not exceed what is necessary for reaching those objectives.

Title of the proposal/initiative  Regulation of the European Parliament and Council on monitoring and controlling drug precursors and repealing Regulations (EC) No 273/2004  1.2. Policy area(s) concerned  Internal Market  Customs Union  External Trade  1.3. Objective(s)  1.3.1. General objective(s)  There are two general policy objectives to be pursued when revising the regulations:  Objective 1: to reduce the availability of drug precursors for illicit drug manufacturing  Objective 2: to facilitate legitimate trade and use of drug precursors, both in the Internal Market and in relation to external trade  1.3.2. Specific objective(s)  Specific objective SO No 1.1 - To establish more effective and rapid control measures to address designer precursors  The aim of SO 1.1 is to ensure that rules do not only address traditional drug precursors but also newly emerging designer precursors, for which a global approach is crucial.  Specific Objective 1.2 – To address gaps and shortcomings that hamper the implementation and the functioning of the control system  SO 1.2 is to improve the regulations by filling in identified gaps and clarifying existing provisions to provide for a uniform application across the EU and enhance cooperation between authorities as well as with businesses.  Specific objective 2.1 – To simplify, modernise and streamline the EU provisions for legal trade  SO 2.1 is about removing unnecessary obstacles and administrative burdens for legal trade in drug precursors.  1.3.3. Expected result(s) and impact  Specify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.  For Objective 1, Member States and operators will have to implement a new ban on designer precursors, that are chemically viable and easy to use, identified with sufficient precision to allow operators to conduct due diligence checks on their portfolios. For Member State authorities, the ban entails an extension of the scope of existing control and monitoring rules.  Other measures include requiring online marketplaces service providers to notify suspicious transactions, disappearances and thefts.  National authorities and customs authorities are being empowered to seize and confiscate both scheduled and non-scheduled drug precursors, if there are reasonable grounds or evidence that the drug precursor is intended for illicit use. In the internal market, Member States remain competent to adopt national rules to investigate such cases, and no additional requirements should be set out in this Regulation.  Ultimately, the measures are aimed at reducing the supply of illicit drugs with corresponding indirect effects on drug consumption, public health, and crime, even if this is not directly measurable.  For Objective 2, Member States and operators will rely on a centralised EU portal that will streamline and support the process for managing licences, registrations, customer verifications, import/export quantity management, and prior notifications. The new rules will also eventually remove periodic reporting obligations for operators and authorities.  Comprehensive digital solutions are expected to facilitate the completion of administrative tasks for operators and to expedite the overall process. Moreover, it will enable competent authorities to verify the legality of drug precursors movements more effectively, improving traceability.  From a customs perspective, digitalisation will enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of controls, providing authorities with faster access to structured, high-quality information that allows for automatic checks of licences/registrations and perform quantity management. This will support faster clearance times for imports and exports while strengthening the EU’s ability to detect and prevent illicit trade.  1.3.4. Indicators of performance  Specify the indicators for monitoring progress and achievements.  Indicator linked to objective 1:  A substantial reduction of availability of precursors for illicit drug manufacturing, based on the annual volume of seized scheduled precursors (2 100 incidents, corresponding to approximately 541 tonnes of precursors seized in 2023, reporting based on the EU database of drug precursors). Previous interventions lead to a reduction of about 60 %.  Indicator linked to objective 2:  A reduction of net administrative burdens for businesses of EUR M 19.84, down from a baseline of annual recurrent costs of EUR M 32.34. This is to be verified by an evaluation no later than 10 years after the entry into application of the revised rules.  1.4. The proposal/initiative relates to:  ☑ a new action  ☐ a new action following a pilot project/preparatory action 59 (1)  ☑ the extension of an existing action  ☐ a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action  1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative  1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative  The new rules for the internal market for drug precursors will start applying to economic operators and national authorities 2 years after the adoption of the new rules.  Amongst others, they concern the ban of designer precursors, the need for prior notifications and the verification of customers.  Experience with developing the system of past projects of integrating certificates in the EU CSW-CERTEX, shows that a period of three years after entry into force of the implementing acts is required to specify, develop, test and deploy the connection of the central e-licensing solution with quantity management, after which three years are needed for the EU CSW-CERTEX interconnection with the national customs systems.  The digitalisation of the supervision of imports, exports and licit trade of drug precursors will replace current procedures, some of which remain paper-based. It will enable a swift and secure electronic communication between actors: economic operators, their customers, competent and customs authorities in Member States.  Once the electronic system has been developed and deployed by the Commission, Member States Customs authorities are expected to connect to it via the EU Customs Single Window – CERTEX (EU CSW-CERTEX).  Competent authorities for single market matters will connect through another affiliated IT system. The IT system for formalities in the internal market will be operational 2 years after the entry into force of the regulation. The Commission will explore how existing IT systems with a similar purpose could be re-used, such as, for instance, the Single Market Compliance Space (SMCS), or the software used for the Digital Waste Shipment System (DIWASS) which will be used for the exchange of documents and information as of 21 May 2026. The DIWASS should be interoperable with other systems and software that are used by some competent authorities or economic operators, as set out in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2025/1290.  Budgetary needs for the internal market IT system managed by GROW are estimated to amount to EUR M 1.070 starting from 2028.  To proceed with the preparations for an electronic system for the control of trade in drug precursors, financial and human resources need to be allocated to TAXUD as soon as possible, starting from 2025. A preliminary analysis based on the possible re-use of the Commission’s electronic licensing systems and building on experience from other e-Licensing systems and the EU Customs Single Window, led to a budget requirements estimation of up to EUR M 25, depending on the IT solution delivery model chosen, for a period from 2025 to 2034(including time dedicated to the preparation of the Implementing Act). The subsequent yearly maintenance cost of the digitalisation of controls at the external borders is estimated at EUR M 0.5. The EUDA will deliver an information repository of drug precursors which will cover all relevant scheduled and non-scheduled substances having or not a known industrial or commercial use which will cost approximately 0.182 M. For the current MFF, the need for additional resources (one contractual agent post) for EUDA will be covered by a contribution agreement to be financed from the existing envelope of the Customs Programme (DG TAXUD) up to and including 2030. The funding for a second additional FTE as of 2028 until 2030 will be covered by the amounts in the EU Facility otherwise foreseen to fund actions in the domain of Home Affairs.  Overall, the digitalisation part of this initiative is aligned with the EU digital strategy to increase the efficiency of public services, improving the quality of communication with economic operators.  1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, greater effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this section 'added value of EU involvement' is the value resulting from EU action, that is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.  Reasons for action at EU level (ex-ante):  The two current EU drug precursors regulations set the rules for the legitimate trade of chemical substances, respectively within the EU and with third countries, that can also be used in illicit drug production. The monitoring and control of trade between the EU and non-EU countries falls under a policy area where the EU has exclusive powers and, therefore, the subsidiarity principle does not apply.  For the internal market, any changes to the scope or requirements of such rules must be made at EU level to avoid: (i) distorting the market; (ii) creating barriers to the free movement of products; or (iii) undermining efforts to prevent diversion of drug precursors.  Expected generated EU added value (ex-post):  EU action would have clear benefits for businesses, national authorities and society as a whole, by simplifying licit trade flows between legitimate businesses within the single market and third countries, and by supporting the fight against illicit drug production. This will also remove unnecessary administrative burdens and reduce those that are necessary for supervising trade flows, such as licenses, registrations or prior notifications.  By ensuring uniform rules instead of 27 different sets of rules and procedures, EU action strengthens the competitiveness of EU businesses.  A fully digitised environment also offers advantages such as an increased effectiveness and speed of controls.  1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past  The evaluation of EU rules on drug precursors (Regulation (EC) No 273/2004 and Council Regulation 111/2005) found several shortcomings, especially concerning designer precursors (drug precursors with no known legitimate use except research and innovation).  Equally, it highlighted opportunities to simplify the complex legal framework and improve procedures for legitimate trade of drug precursors, thus reducing administrative burdens.  From an enforcement perspective, it demonstrated possibilities for quicker action from Member States, based on a more uniform application of rules.  Experience has shown that industry and Member States authorities need sufficient time to familiarise themselves with new requirements and to adapt their business processes accordingly.  Developing the IT system of past projects of integrating certificates in the EU CSW-CERTEX, shows that a period of three years after entry into force of the implementing acts is required to specify, develop, test and deploy the connection of the central e-licensing solution with quantity management, after which three years for the EU CSW-CERTEX interconnection with the national customs systems are needed. The synergies with the existing e-Licensing platforms are key, using a comprehensive online platform for processing applications and issuing licences, brings further harmonisation of the applied procedures. It is however to be noted that the drug precursors project presents certain particularities when compared to existing systems, and this will have to be reflected in its architecture.  1.5.4. Compatibility with the multiannual financial framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments  Synergies are expected through an improvement in the enforcement of rules on illicit drug trafficking and a stronger cooperation with the EU Drugs Agency (EUDA). Scheduled drug precursors are part of the material scope of minimum national rules on criminal acts concerning precursors set out by Member States in accordance with Council Framework Decision 2004/757/JHA on combatting drug trafficking. By extending the scope of substances scheduled, the application of the Framework Decision is expected to be strengthened.  The initiative also reduces administrative and reporting requirements for economic operators and national authorities.  1.5.5. Assessment  The costs incurred between 2025 and 2027 for DG TAXUD will be covered by the Customs programme. The amount of around EUR M 1.3 will be financed by the financial envelope allocated to the Customs programme under the Commission’s MFF 2021-2027. The next financial envelope allocated to the Customs programme in the next MFF should cover the remaining costs of fully digitalising the drug precursors domain. The costs depend on the IT solution delivery model and might be up to additional around EUR M 24 (see below tables). That amount, estimated in the period 2028-2034, is subject to the revision of the related rates of the new DG TAXUD framework contracts that will be revised presumably in 2028. In addition, from 2035 onwards, an annual maintenance fee for this system of EUR M 0.5 should be foreseen. The post-2027 figures are indicative, without pre-empting and pre-judging the Commission proposal and the agreement on the next MFF.  For the internal market aspects of the proposal, no costs will be incurred under the current MFF.  1.6.

Comments  [...]  2. MANAGEMENT MEASURES  2.1. Monitoring and reporting rules  The impact of the initiative will be assessed through its evaluation which is planned no later than 10 years after the entry into application of the revised rules.  The centralised electronic system will allow for an efficient and continuous monitoring of operational activities. Most notably, it will harmonise the annual reporting requirements to the UN on legal trade and incidents related to drug precursors.  In addition, the Commission and to some extent EUDA will continuously monitor the application of the rules and the developments in precursor trade that may warrant an adaptation of the scope of the measures.  2.2. Management and control system(s)  2.2.1. Justification of the budget implementation method(s), the funding implementation mechanism(s), the payment modalities and the control strategy proposed  The Regulation establishes new substantive requirements with regard to controlling the licit trade of drug precursors while ensuring fair competition among market actors in the internal market.  These new rules require an improved digital system for monitoring and controlling the internal and external trade of drug precursors. The enforcement and successful implementation of the new Regulation is estimated to require an additional FTE in the European Drugs Agency (EUDA) that will be financed under the contribution agreement between DG TAXUD and EUDA up to and including 2030  2.2.2. Information concerning the risks identified and the internal control system(s) set up to mitigate them  The risks associated to the financial transactions implementing the central electronic system are limited.  The specifications, development and operations of the central electronic system are implemented using existing framework contracts and/or via co-delegation to other Commission services.

Requirements of digital relevance  The effects of simplification of the legal framework, digitisation of processes and streamlining of obligations should contribute to positive impacts related to Objective #2, the facilitation of trade (and competition). Processes should be more efficient, there are fewer obligations to comply with overall.  Where currently Regulation (EC) 273/2004 requires verification of customer declarations through, in practice, paper-based procedures (since stamped copies of declarations are required), this measure would ensure a digital solution for the verification of customers trading in drug precursors internally. The digital solution would be an off-the-shelf digital solution, which provides for secure electronic interactions across the EU between businesses and public authorities.  The obligations would be significantly streamlined for operators, with negligible implications for control overall, and significant savings for both public authorities and economic operators. Obligations that can be digitalised become digital, and those that (due to a centrally - EU - developed and digital solution) can be automated, are removed for operators. The solution would need to have the necessary functions listed in the Table below, including the requirements for customer verification (i.e., it allows for mutually recognised digital signatures, exchanging, and storing of documentation, etc.)  The proposed requirements would be driven by a centralised system connected with customs IT solutions via EU CSW-CERTEX to allow cross-check and availability check of license and/or registration for import or export transaction and quantity management. As such, the most significant work to establish the digital solution would be borne by the European Commission. Economic operators and Competent authorities responsible for the registration of operators and issuance of licences will use the central solution. With the digital solution, the EU eLicensing central portal for licenses and registrations would be connected to the EU Customs Single Window Certificates Exchange System and would contain information on substances, validity, quantity and whether exemptions apply, meaning that the authorisation process could be automated. Customs authorities of Member States stand to implement and interconnect the central solution with their national export and import systems once the processes are digitised.  The requirements of digital relevance are listed in the table below:  Table: Row 1 — Reference to the requirement; Requirement description; Actor(s) affected or concerned by the requirement; High-level Processes; Categories Row 2 — R1: Article 35(2), point (a)(i); Access to the digital solution for operators (legal entities) legally trading with DP and public authorities; Economic operators, online market places, competent authorities, Commission; Management of registries; Digital Public Service, Digital Solution, Data Row 3 — R2: Article 35(2), points (a)(ii), (iii) and (iv); Submission of licence application, registration or prior-notification by economic operators; Economic operators, competent authorities, Commission; Filing an application or notification; Digital Public Service.

Security and privacy:  As personal information will be stored in the central data base, compliance with the data protection legal acts is a must. Ownership of information remains at any time at national level, while ensuring strong security of information. The information to which each user/system will get access will be based on a strict need-to-know policy.  Openness and transparency:  The availability of all data is foreseen for validity check of license, self-registration and prior notification by trade partners of operators. The information will be available on a need-to-know basis as users will be assigned access to the database based on the credential provided by trader to its trade partner (by using QR code or eWallet). Transparency, harmonisation, and cross-checks of licences/registration will be ensured by the centralised repository storing the related information accessible to the authorities involved in the process.  Alignment with the EU Customs Data Model  The interaction with customs systems will be ensured by the compliance with the EU Customs Data Model (EUCDM). The data in scope and content is information related to the export and import of the goods. It will be available in the Commission Implementing Act, the specification of data requirement of every data field relevant for external trade will be described in the Delegated Regulation. The EU Customs Data Model is fully aligned with European Data Strategy.

The solution will have a significant impact on the following stakeholders: · Economic operators involved in external trade in drug precursors , who apply for licences electronically via the new system. · EU Member States competent authorities who receive applications for and issue licences · EU countries’ customs offices who control customs declarations of drug precursors and verify the relevant licences electronically. The European Commission, which is responsible for the development and maintenance of the system, ensuring its functionality and compliance. The EU countries are responsible for connecting their national customs systems to the EU CSW-CERTEX, which in turn ensures connection to the central solution.;  Row 4 — Measures taken to ensure a shared understanding of the data Please list such measures; - Data management will prioritise usability, reliability, and security, and support agile updates to meet evolving legal and operational requirements. The system will be aligned with the EU Customs Data Model (EUCDM) to ensure full interoperability with customs IT systems and compliance with EU customs legislation. Data elements required for import and export procedures will be harmonised and incorporated into future amendments to implementing and delegated regulations related to external trade in drug precursors.; - Row 5 — Use of commonly agreed open technical specifications and standards Please list such measures; - Interoperability with customs systems such as EU CSW-CERTEX and TARIC is foreseen.; -  Describe the digital public service(s) affected by the requirements  The solution needs to be consistent with the EU Customs Single Window Digital Framework Policy. Where relevant, national single window systems would be connected to the EU Customs Single Window Certificates Exchange System, which in turn would be connected to the EU web portal for EO drug precursor procedures. Interoperability with international IT solutions such as PEN online could be ensured by the elaboration of the necessary technical specifications and the compliance to them. A machine-to-machine interface for communication with third countries authorities would facilitate the cross-border collaboration and administrative cooperation. MSs could access and see the messages such as PEN notifications received from third countries’ partners in a web-based interface.  In line with the recommendations of the F4F Platform, Member States are requested to report incidents once only and in real-time through the EU. To avoid a duplication of reporting requirements an IT solution that allows for an exchange with the current UN alert system (PICS) would be required . If possible , the platform should communicate with INCB’s PICS to avoid ‘double reporting’ burden and ensure consistency in the data gathered at EU and international level. MS will have to upload the information in the EU system, and such system could transmit the information to PICS.  The digital solutions could ensure interoperability across domains, including between the EU DP solution and customs systems for trade formalities and the reporting requirements of the international control system (e.g. PEN online, Form D, etc.).  The Interoperable Europe solutions identified for (re)use:  -  Interoperability with MSs national customs IT solutions should be ensured in line with rules and agreements on personal data processing and control.  As regards the possible interoperability of the new system with the solutions of the INCB who is responsible for the building of IT application of United Nations the EU signed the UN convention with elements of international cooperation in the area of preventing diversion of drug precursors. If applicable, the UN therefore should ensure compliance of its systems to the GDPR rules and conditions of SLA agreements allowing EU authorities to perform the work without delay. The centralised solution will ensure that the issued and electronically submitted certificates are available to customs authorities for cross-checks 24/7 (classified as “Silver” CI), hence not depending on non-synchronised working hours. No remaining barriers to cross-border interoperability are detected at the moment.  Interoperability with other customs systems such as the TARIC, EORI, CRMS etc. is envisaged.  4.5. Measures to support digital implementation  High-level description of measures supporting digital implementation  Table: Row 1 — Description of the measure; Reference(s) to the requirement(s); Commission role (if applicable); Actors to be involved (if applicable); Expected timeline (if applicable) Row 2 — The Commission shall adopt implementing acts establishing common technical specifications for the electronic system; Art. 35(7), Art. 37; Commission to adopt the act; Member States; 18 months after entry into force of the basic act. Row 3 — Committee procedure; Art. 35(7); The Commission shall be assisted by a committee. That committee shall be a committee within the meaning of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011.; The Commission; committee; Member States; 18 months after entry into force into force of the basic act.  The list of business functionalities is at high level and purely indicative at this stage and will be fine-tuned in context of the business analysis and inception phases, supported in part by the COM IT governance (Business Case and Project Charter), and to be legally covered in the dedicated Implementing Act for the external and international dimensions of the initiative.  Depending on the decision of ITCB 77 on the alternatives for development of the solution and delivery model, The Commission will chose between outsourcing the work to an external contractor or developing in-house (e.g. by DG GROW/DG SANTE/DG Trade etc).  As a first activity related to the development of the DP Licencing system and based on the experience gained from other EU projects for the issuance of digital certificates, a prototype for the issuance module shall be prepared, followed by a piloting activity. The Commission will organize a Conformance tests (CT) campaign in cooperation with MSs. All necessary information and documentation for the CT campaign (Integration Guide for Member States, CT Plan, CT Organization Document) will be provided and organizational meetings will be organized prior to the campaign.  To ensure the smooth implementation of the requirements, the Commission will:  - Create a dedicated team to manage the specifications (functional and technical ones) and the implementation of the system, facilitating the collaboration between all stakeholders.  - Create guidelines for the implementation (functional and technical specifications) of the needed services for interaction with the DP eLicencing system by the EU MSs.  - Develop and maintain the common components of the system needed for the issuance and the exchange of certificates with a central repository, and an administrative cooperation.  - Extend the functionalities of EU CSW-CERTEX for the new domain of drug precursors and interaction with the EU MS National customs systems.  - Maintain (in technical means) a central registry of authorised users, including EOs of EU MSs and partner countries.  - Extend the existing platforms used in the EU for the authentication, authorisation and connection of users from the international partners.  - Provide the relevant guidelines (i.e., user manuals, GUI help desk procedures, and training materials) for the DP eLicencing system GUI.  - Discuss, elaborate and provide the needed information guidelines (e.g., specifications, connectivity instructions, training materials) to international partners to be connected via machine-to-machine interface such as INCB.  - Provide trainings for the users of the system, including operators, officials of MS medicine and customs authorities.  - Provide the GUI (user interface) of the system in all EU languages. The platform will be able to support other languages for the future needs, apart from Latin and Cyrillic alphabet  - Provide a centralised 3rd level IT support in English.  The central support from EC will be provided only to national service desks of customs authorities, not for businesses. Technical Support will be provided by DG DIGIT. After the adoption of the proposal by the Commission the process of interinstitutional negotiations between co-legislators will start. In parallel with this process the responsible body in charge of digitalisation will start business analysis in order to compose Project Initiation Request and Business Case for submission to ITCB. In parallel to this work the Commission shall start drafting implementing acts on details of IT solution and data elements and its formats to be exchanged to be adopted based on business analysis. The Commission could also negotiate and adopt agreements on bilateral arrangements with third parties such as UN/INCB on data exchange together with Annex on technical arrangements.

This initiative addresses the growing challenges posed by drug-related violence and the emergence of more potent drugs. The regulation focuses on substances that, while having legitimate industrial uses, can be diverted for illicit drug production. A key component of the proposal is the creation of a Repository managed by the European Union Drugs Agency (EUDA). This Repository will gather information on both scheduled and non-scheduled drug precursors, aiding operators in identifying suspicious transactions and assisting authorities in deciding whether to regulate new substances.

The proposal underscores the importance of digitalization in reducing costs and administrative burdens for the chemical industry, a crucial sector in the EU. It requires operators involved in the market, import, export, and intermediary activities with scheduled drug precursors to maintain detailed commercial documents for each transaction. Additionally, the proposal includes provisions for training national authorities and operators, promoting cooperation between member states, and enhancing the powers of customs and competent authorities to monitor and control precursor diversion.

Operators must request updates to their licenses if they plan to exceed estimated quantities, handle new substances, undertake additional activities, or change business premises. Competent authorities may update licenses based on documentary checks, and decisions to refuse, revoke, or suspend licenses will be communicated electronically and are subject to appeal under national law. External traders are required to register information, including contact details, Economic Operators Registration and Identification (EORI) numbers, and details of responsible officers",

CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  This legislative proposal puts forward amendments to the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR – Regulation (EU) 2019/2088) 1 . The SFDR was adopted on 27 November 2019 and has been in application since March 2021. It represents one of the first pieces of the EU Sustainable Finance framework and is part of a broader package of sustainability disclosure rules, tools and standards for non-financial and financial companies adopted pursuant to the Commission’s 2018 Action Plan on Financing Sustainable Growth 2 .  The SFDR is a disclosure framework which sets detailed sustainability disclosures for financial intermediaries and financial products regarding how they consider various environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors. Its objective is to increase transparency, combat greenwashing and protect investors by ensuring that information in this respect is disclosed to investors by financial market participants such as asset managers and pension providers, and by financial advisers. More broadly, the SFDR thus contributes to the aims of: (i) helping to attract private funding to facilitate the transition towards greater sustainability; and (ii) helping European companies to seize competitive opportunities in this area.  The SFDR is complemented by a Commission Delegated Regulation 3 which lays down detailed disclosure rules for how financial market participants and financial advisers should disclose sustainability information towards investors about their investment activities and their financial products in order to help the latter make informed choices. The Delegated Regulation specifies notably the details of the information to be disclosed to investors in pre-contractual documents, on websites and in periodic reports both for financial market participants as entities and for the financial products which they make available.  For entity-level disclosures, financial market participants and financial advisers are required to explain how they integrate ESG considerations into their internal procedures, including their due diligence processes and consideration of responsible business practices. For product-level disclosures, including for investment funds, insurance-based investment products and pension products, they are required to disclose sustainability characteristics and objectives. Article 8 of the SFDR establishes that, for products that promote environmental or social characteristics, financial market participants must show how they promote such environmental and social characteristics. Article 9 of the SFDR establishes that, for products that have a sustainable investment as their objective, financial market participants must explain the sustainability objective and show how the objective is attained. Finally, all products in the scope of the SFDR are subject to the disclosures under Article 6 of the SFDR, according to which financial market participants must disclose how sustainability risks are integrated in the investment decision process when relevant, as well as the results of the assessment of the likely impacts of sustainability risks on the returns of the products.  Since its inception, the SFDR has had broad-reaching effects on the market, accompanying a stead il y increasing demand for financial products with ESG characteristics. Products disclosing under Articles 8 and 9 of the SFDR account for almost 50% of EU Assets under Management (AuM), representing more than 60% of EU funds 4 . Europe is by far the largest market for such funds, accounting for up to 84% of global sustainable fund assets 5 .  The comprehensive assessment of the SFDR undertaken by the Commission under Article 19 of the Regulation since 2023 has however identified several shortcomings that have emerged since its entry into application. The evidence gathered showed that while the objectives of the SFDR remain broadly supported, several aspects of the rules are considered complex, difficult to implement, and ineffective. Problems of misalignment between concepts and definitions in the SFDR and in other EU sustainable finance legislation, coupled with challenges for financial market participants to access reliable and comprehensive ESG data, have contributed to the complexity of the framework. Evidence shows that the objective of investor protection has not been sufficiently well served, compounded by the misuse of Articles 8 and 9 as quasi-labels and the lack of clarity regarding certain concepts and obligations.  The review of the SFDR is included among the simplification initiatives in the 2025 Commission Work Programme 6 . In line with the Political Guidelines for 2024-2029 7 , the objective is to stay the course on the goals set out in the European Green Deal, but with simpler rules, lower administrative burden and better enforcement. The need for simplification of the sustainable finance framework to lower compliance costs for companies in the EU was also highlighted in the Report on ‘The future of European competitiveness 8 ’ by Mario Draghi.  Against this background, the Commission proposes to review the SFDR to make it more efficient, simple and proportionate. Key in this effort is ensuring the integrity of the EU single market for sustainable finance by focusing on requirements which mitigate risks of greenwashing and better help investors seize and compare opportunities in sustainability-linked financial products. At the same time, the review aims at boosting the competitiveness of Europe’s financial sector by ensuring conditions which make business easier and deepening the single market for sustainability-linked financial products, thus helping to allocate capital for Europe’s sustainable prosperity.  The proposed changes pursue two objectives. The first is to simplify and reduce the sustainability-related administrative and disclosure requirements for financial market participants and financial advisers, as well as to enhance the coherence of the framework for the operational needs of financial market participants. The second is to improve end-investors’ ability to understand and compare sustainability-linked financial products, and to protect them against potential misleading ESG claims.  The present proposal therefore puts forward a considerable simplification of reporting requirements, and a three-way categorisation of financial products with ESG features, incorporating wide stakeholder feedback and building on current market practices. The proposal also makes targeted consequential amendments to Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 on packaged retail and insurance-based investment products (PRIIPS) 9 and repeals Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288 10 , implementing the current SFDR , as of the date of application of the new framework.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  The SFDR is closely linked with other pieces of the sustainable finance framework, including the EU Taxonomy 11 , the EU Benchmarks Regulation 12 , the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) 13 , the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) 14 , as well as relevant parts of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) 15 , , the Insurance Distribution Directive (IDD) 16 and the Shareholder Rights Directive (SRD) 17 . Together, they support companies and the financial sector in mobilis ing private funding into sustainable projects and technologies. In particular, reporting obligations for financial market participants under the SFDR build on the reporting obligations for companies under the CSRD and the Taxonomy Regulation. The review of the SFDR is thus necessary to reflect the changes introduced by the proposed ‘Omnibus’ 18 simplifications regarding sustainability information from companies, in particular the future scope of the corporate disclosures from companies under the CSRD.  The review also builds on the guidelines by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) on funds’ names using ESG or sustainability - related terms 19 . For the purposes of ensuring that ESG claims under the revised SFDR are clear, fair and not misleading, financial market participants should also consult supervisory guidance prepared by the European Supervisory Authorities 20 . Moreover , the notion of ESG-related claims made by financial products regarding how and the extent to which categorised products invest in or contribute to either transition or sustainability objectives, or integrate sustainability factors in their investment strategy beyond sustainability risk management considerations, is consistent with the notion of ‘environmental claims ’ under Article 2(1)(o) of Directive 2005/29/EC (Unfair Commercial Practices Directive , as amended by Directive (EU) 2024/825 as regards empowering consumers for the green transition 21 ) . Consistent with Article 3(4) of Directive 2005/ 29/EC , requirements under th at Directive would be met by proper application of the requirements of this Regulation.  Finally, given that this Regulation adapts the information requirements related to the degree to which financial products invest in sustainability-related activities, including activities that contribute to an environmental objective as set out in Article 9 of the Taxonomy Regulation, the requirement for financial market participants to disclose the information under Articles 5 to 7 of the Taxonomy Regulation is henceforth no longer a blanket obligation but flows from whether and the extent to which they choose to use the Taxonomy Regulation in this respect. Further, the references in those Articles of the Taxonomy Regulation would no longer refer to paragraphs involving disclosures under Article 8 and 9 of the SFDR, but to criteria for sustainability-related product categories, and are thus also moot. Likewise, there is no longer an obligation for these disclosures to mention the statements referred to in Articles 6 and 7 of the Taxonomy Regulation regarding the shares of financial products that take and do not take into account EU criteria for environmentally sustainable economic activities under that Regulation.  • Consistency with other Union policies  As mentioned above, the SFDR review is a simplification initiative in the 2025 Commission Work Programme and part of the follow-up to the Draghi report. The proposed changes aim to facilitate the implementation of the sustainable finance framework . Consistent with the broader simplification agenda and the objective of delivering simpler rules through better implementation under the S avings and I nvestments U nion , the Commission has published a list of non-essential level 2 measures which includes the repeal of several level 2 measures stemming from the SFDR. 22  The updated rules will also address current barriers to the cross-border distribution of financial products with sustainability features which impede the potential of the single market in sustainable finance from effectively mobilising savings towards Europe’s sustainable prosperity. The new rules should therefore promote a more effective functioning of the single market for sustainable finance, including by improving transparency and empowering investors across the Union to participate in EU capital markets in line with the objectives of the Savings and Investments Union 23 .  In the same spirit of the recently published initiatives to advance the S avings and I nvestment s U nion, such as the recommendations on the Savings and Investment Accounts (SIAs) 24 , the SFDR is also aimed at supporting measures to create better financial opportunities and financial outcomes for citizens who wish to invest . It is specifically designed for individuals looking to grow their savings by investing in financial markets in alignment with their sustainability preferences . In addition, the Commission’s strategy on financial literacy, aimed at helping citizens better understand investment principles, opportunities and risks 25 , will allow citizens and investors to get a greater understanding of the economic effects of choosing to finance certain activities, as well as their impacts and implications for employment, sustainability, social outcomes and resilience.  The review will contribute to the objectives of the European Green Deal in a more efficient way, including climate neutrality under the Climate Law 26 , the environmental transition supported by an innovative and circular economy, and the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  Finally, the SFDR review builds on the guidance from the Commission on the application of the EU sustainable finance framework regarding the defence sector, presented in the Communication on a European Defence Industrial Strategy 27 and delivered through the June 2025 Defence Readiness Omnibus 28 , which was announced in the March 2025 Joint White Paper for European Defence Readiness 2030 29 . It is therefore fully consistent with the objectives of the Joint White Paper and the Defence Readiness Roadmap 2030 30 to further bolster access to finance for the defence and space sector.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  The legal basis of the review is the same as the existing Regulation (EU) 2019/2088, meaning Article 114 of the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which allows the adoption of measures for the approximation of national provisions having as their object the establishment and functioning of the internal market. The revised rules help underpin the effective and efficient functioning of the internal market for sustainable finance, safeguard competition between different financial market participants and incentivise behavioural changes toward greater innovation.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  This proposal complies with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). The need for a coherent common framework for sustainability-related disclosures for financial products across the EU was established as part of the original SFDR. The objectives remain fully valid and enjoy broad stakeholder support. Without effective Union-level action, the problems identified since the entry into force of the Regulation would persist and would not be tackled in an effective, efficient and coherent way. Financial market participants and investors would continue to face undue complexity in the application of the rules. Excessively lengthy disclosure rules and templates involving sustainability characteristics in the business practices of financial market participants, as well as in the financial products they offer to investors, would remain in place. Uncertainty and insufficient comparability would continue to mark the availability of ESG financial products, negatively impacting their credibility and uptake.  Given the problems outlined above, the necessary simplification and adjustment of the existing SFDR framework can only be implemented in a coherent and effective way at EU level. This effective EU-level action would also help scale up private sustainable finance across the Union, boost the proper functioning of the single market for sustainable finance and ultimately contribute to improving transparency for investors to enable their participation in EU capital markets, in line with the objectives of the Savings and Investments Union.  • Proportionality  The proposed amendments respect the principle of proportionality, as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). They do not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives of simplification, transparency and investor protection, while achieving the scaling up of private sustainable finance in support of Europe’s sustainability and competitiveness goals. In addition, based on the proportionality principle, the present proposal builds on market practices.  • Choice of the instrument  This proposal amends Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 via an amending Regulation. A directly applicable regulation, providing full harmonisation, is needed to address market fragmentation and reduce the scope for additional national rules to tackle perceived shortcomings and ensure the desired simplification of requirements and disclosures, for the benefit of both financial market participants and investors, in a harmonised way throughout the Union.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  In December 2022, the Commission announced a comprehensive assessment of the SFDR framework. Two consultations were issued (one public and one targeted) running from September until December 2023.  The assessment served to gather feedback on the functioning of the framework and assessing any shortcomings with regard to how well it is achieving its ultimate objectives. In particular, this concerned how the rules were working in terms of helping to attract private funding to facilitate the transition of the European economy towards greater sustainability and, as part of this, empowering investors to better understand and compare the products on offer.  The assessment and its various steps, outlined in the next section, were recapped in an evaluation of the SFDR, carried out as part of the impact assessment accompanying this proposal (see under ‘Impact assessment’ below). The evaluation results help identify and confirm the key problem drivers, and inform the lessons learned for the review.  • Stakeholder consultations  The following section provides an overview of the stakeholder consultations carried out for the review:  – Targeted and open public consultations  – Technical workshops and roundtables  – Commission expert group opinions (Platform for Sustainable Finance – PSF)  – Input from the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs)  – Engagement with Member States  – Continuous engagement with experts  – Call for Evidence  Targeted and open public consultations  Two public consultations ran from September to December 2023 (targeted 31 and open 32 ). A summary report 33 was published in May 2024.  324 organisations and individuals participated in the targeted consultation. Financial market participants and financial advisers made up the largest group of respondents, followed by NGOs. Respondents were predominantly from EU countries. Respondents from non-EU countries were mostly from the UK and the US.  The responses showed significant support for the SFDR policy goals but mixed views on how the implementation of the regulation delivered against its specific objectives. The majority of respondents agreed that the SFDR was currently not being used solely as a disclosure framework as intended, but also as a labelling and marketing tool (in particular the disclosures under Article 8 and 9). Many also highlighted that inconsistencies between different parts of the sustainable finance framework pose challenges for both financial market participants and end investors and queried whether the SFDR is the right place to set entity-level disclosure requirements to inform investors. Most respondents called for the disclosures and sustainability-related concepts to be simplified and made more meaningful for investors.  The majority of respondents supported setting up an EU categorisation system for ESG financial products, focused on retail investors, accounting for the international investments of EU financial products, and leveraging existing market practices.  Technical workshops and roundtables  To complement the replies to the targeted and open consultations, the Commission held four technical workshops to gather further technical comments. The workshops took place in October and December 2023, and in January 2024. An additional technical roundtable was conducted with consumers’ associations in December 2024 to analyse the existing EU consumer testing studies on retail investors’ sustainability preferences and understanding.  PSF opinions  The Platform for Sustainable Finance (PSF), a Commission expert group, submitted input in two opinions . The first, from December 2023 34 addresses the main questions raised by the Commission in the targeted consultation. In December 2024, the PSF published a second opinion 35 , outlining how a categorisation system for sustainable finance products could be set up and calibrated, with a proposal to set up three categories (called ‘sustainable’, ‘transition’ and ‘ESG collection’). The opinion covered the current state of ESG financial markets and the potential impact that setting certain thresholds could have on current products falling under Articles 8 and 9 of the SFDR.  Input from the ESAs  The European Supervisory Authorities delivered in June 2024 a joint opinion on the assessment of the SFDR 36 where they suggested to set up new categories, a ‘sustainable product’ category and a ‘transition product’ category. ESMA published its own further opinion “ Sustainable investments: facilitating the investor journey ” in July 2024 where among other things it strongly encouraged the establishment of a categorisation system 37 .  Engagement with Member States  The European Commission engaged with Member States in the context of the Member State s Expert Group 38 in two meetings (December 2024 39 and June 2025 40 ), requesting their feedback and comments. The Commission also received numerous letters and position papers from Member State authorities and National Competent Authorities (NCAs) presenting their views on the review of the SFDR.  Continuous engagement with experts  The European Commission engaged continuously with experts such as financial market participants, investors, NGOs, consumers’ associations, trade associations, academics and other interested stakeholders, on key challenges with the current SFDR and on how to set up categories.  Call for Evidence  Finally, the Commission gathered feedback during the Call for Evidence which ran from 2 May to 30 May 2025 41 . 195 stakeholders submitted their views. The largest group of respondents were businesses associations and companies, followed by NGOs, and to a lesser extent, national authorities. Respondents were predominantly from EU countries, with France, Germany, Belgium, Italy and Netherlands being the most represented.  • Collection and use of expertise  In addition to the feedback collected above, the Commission reviewed several studies and additional data sources, from both stakeholder and academic sources, including the study requested by the ECON Committee of the European Parliament on “the current implementation of the SFDR” 42 , quoted in the impact assessment accompanying the proposal.  Material used to prepare the impact assessment and inform policy choices comes from diverse market participants and stakeholders, as well as other reputable and well-recognised sources. Findings were cross-checked across different information sources to avoid biases caused by outliers or vested interests.  • Impact assessment  An impact assessment was carried out to prepare this legislative proposal. On 2 July 2025, the impact assessment report was examined by the Regulatory Scrutiny Board (RSB). Following a first negative opinion, the Board issued a positive opinion with reservations on 8 October 2025.  In its comments, the RSB notably requested that the policy options should be better specified to allow for an adequate assessment and comparison, that the option of repealing the SFDR should be fully assessed alongside other options, that the coherence with the simplifications under the Omnibus proposals should be better established, and that the feasibility of creating reliable categories should be better evidenced including given challenges with ESG data availability impacted by the Omnibus. A more detailed description of what the policy options would concretely look like was thus added, mainly by providing illustrative details for the future streamlined disclosures, to be further specified in implementing measures, and more detailed criteria for the three proposed categories. A full analysis of the repeal option was added, along with further analysis to demonstrate the steps needed in the review to ensure coherence with the Omnibus. Further evidence was added on the feasibility to set ESG disclosures that would be meaningful and would be based on broadly available, comparable and credible sustainability information which responds to investors’ demand. Finally, the analysis of costs, benefits and savings was further substantiated to support the above, based on data which was available and reliable. The policy options explored in the impact assessment aim at defining the essential features of the disclosures and categories for the revised Regulation , clearly framing the limited areas for supplementary rules needed in future implementing measures . Besides coherence between the SFDR and the rest of the sustainable finance framework, including the changes entailed by the Omnibus in terms of sustainability disclosures applicable to corporates, an important consideration was recognising and building upon current market practices, to ensure a sufficient degree of continuity with appropriate criteria in the categorisation of products that are already being applied by markets, namely building on the ESMA fund name guidelines 43 .  To achieve the objectives set for the review, the preferred options were assessed to be:  (i) deleting disclosures at entity level regarding principal adverse impacts, largely cancelling out the costs associated with entity-level disclosures (25% of the overall costs linked to the disclosures, saving an annual total of EUR 56 million in recurring costs), and removing any duplication between the SFDR and CSRD;  (ii)  significantly reducing product-level disclosures, refocusing on templates for categorised products with fewer sustainability indicators, facilitating comparability and investors’ decisions, and considerably cutting the recurring costs linked to product disclosures;  (iii) setting up 3 categories for ‘sustainable’, ‘transition’, and ‘ESG basic s ’ products 44 , covering a significant share of today’s ESG financial products, ensuring a coherent set of EU rules for all ESG-focused products toward which end-investors interested in sustainability could be directed by distributors ( under subsequent changes to the delegated acts under MiFID and IDD ) . While some initial one - off costs from the creation of product categories are anticipated, recurring costs are expected to be lower than those of the current SFDR in the longer term and, overall, are offset by the savings achieved by the other elements of the review.  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  The combination of the preferred options has the potential to considerably simplify and improve the efficiency of the legislation. The proposal is directly relevant for SMEs who represent the majority of financial market participants in scope. Well over 25% of the estimated costs for SMEs with the current rules (about EUR 163 million of annual recurring costs, of which about EUR 43 million are for entity-level disclosures and EUR 120 million for product level disclosures) are expected to be reduced. The reduction of entity-level costs in the present proposal is certain with only minimal one-off costs, and while sufficient data could not be gathered on costs associated with the creation of product categories, it can be expected that more than 50% of product-level costs can be saved thanks to the significant reduction of product-level disclosures. In addition, SMEs would benefit more than proportionally from simplification as pronounced cost digression effects are observed, i.e. in relative terms SMEs incur much higher costs than larger firms due to certain minimum efforts that are necessary to build and maintain sustainability-related disclosures.  SMEs are also indirectly affected as investees, as they can, together with the safeguards of the Omnibus (value chain cap), benefit from the flow of funds and be included in products under a simple categorisation system.  In conclusion, the reduced administrative requirements linked to the removal of entity-level disclosures eliminates burdens estimated to account for 25% of the costs under the current rules, largely incumbent on financial market participants which are SMEs. In addition, the simplification of product-level disclosures and introduction of product categories building on market practices, which overall are expected to allow cost savings, are estimated to facilitate further overall burden reduction for SMEs toward the 35% target.  • Fundamental rights  The proposal promotes rights enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights (the ‘Charter’). It integrates due consideration for the respect of human rights, gender equality, fair and just working conditions and prohibition of child labour by companies (Articles 5, 23, 31 and 32 of the Charter), a high level of environmental protection (Article 37 of the Charter) as well as social cohesion (Article 36 of the Charter) and consumer protection (Article 38 of the Charter) since its main objective is to protect the integrity of the EU single market for sustainable finance by ensuring requirements which mitigate risks of greenwashing, and to better help investors seize opportunities in sustainability-linked financial products.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  The proposal does not have a budgetary impact for the Commission.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  The Commission will monitor the implementation of the changes proposed in the Regulation through established processes underway in particular with the European Supervisory Authorities and the Platform for Sustainable Finance (PSF).  Three years after the entry into application of the Regulation, the ESAs and the NCAs would be tasked to survey and assess the implementation costs linked to the new categorisation system. The Commission could also work with the ESAs to conduct regular assessments of occurrences of greenwashing and supervise sustainability-related claims, and with the PSF to conduct a targeted analysis of the regime and assess the degree of uptake of the categorisation system and the implementation of simplified disclosures. Finally, the Commission would work with the ESAs and consumer associations to measure consumer satisfaction a few years after the implementation of the regime.  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  Article 1 introduces the following amendments to Regulation (EU) 2019/2088:  (1) Changes to the subject matter (Article 1 SFDR) to reflect the revised scope focused on financial market participants who manufacture, make available or manage financial products (i.e. removing financial advisers who do not carry out this activity from the scope) and including the creation of categories for sustainability-related financial products .  (2) Consequential changes to some definitions , including notably the deletion of financial advisers and the addition of definitions for categorised ‘sustainability-related’ products as well as those categorised pro ducts claiming to achieve ‘impact’ as part of their strategy (Article 2 SFDR) .  (3) Deletion of Article 2a SFDR on the empowerment for ESAs to develop regulatory technical standards to be adopted by the Commission regarding the principle of do no significant harm , consistent with the list published by the Commission of implementing measures considered non-essential (‘de-prioritisation list’) 45 .  (4) Amendment of Article 3 to re flect removal of financial advisers from the scope .  (5) Deletion of entity-level disclosure requirements in Articles 4 and 5 regarding, respectively, principal adverse impact s and remuneration policies , also consistent with the de-prioritisation list .  (6) Amendment of Article 6 to re flect removal of financial advisers from the scope .  (7) Addition of new Article 6a on specific transparency restrictions for non-categorised products, as a result of the creation of categories for ‘sustainab ility-related financial products’ . Notably, to protect investors, non-categorised products, while not prevented from including information in the ir pre-contractual and periodic d isclosures on whether and how th ey consider sustainability factors, are required to ensure that such information is not a central element of those disclosures and do es not constitute sustainability-related claims reserved for categorised products.  (8) Creation of categories for financial products with transition (Article 7), ESG basic s (Article 8), or sustainable features (Article 9) , including the main criteria for financial products to qualify in each category, th e exclusions which products in each category should not invest in, and the information to be disclosed to investors . The revised Articles also repeal the previous empowerments, in accordance with the de-prioritisation list. The order of the revised Articles re flect s continuity with the existing usage of, notably, Articles 8 and 9 as shorthand for products with different environmental and social features.  (9) Addition of new Article 9a on financial products investing in or combining categorised products , to clarify when these products are e l i gible to meet the criteria of a given category , and to set out transparency rules for how non-categorised financial products which invest in categorised financial products , but not in the amounts which would qualify those products as categ orised themselves, should disclose information about those investments . N otably , such products should set out what share of their investments are in categorised financial products , relying on the information regarding the latter provided by financial market participants in the investment chain .  (10) Amendment of Article 10 on website disclosures by financial market participants , reflecting the revised sco p e , the creation of categories for ‘sustainability-related financial products’ , and consistent with the de-prioritisation list .  (11) Amendment of Article 11 on periodic disclosures by financial market participants on an annual basis , reflecting the revised scope, the creation of categories for ‘sustainability-related financial products’, and consistent with the de-prioritisation list .  (12) Change to Article 12, to re flect removal of financial advisers from the scope .  (13) Addition of a new Article 12a setting out principles for financial market participants on the use of data and estimates for the purposes of this Regulation as well as rules on the information to be provided to investors upon request on relevant data source s and assumptions underpinning estimates .  (14) Amendments to Article 13 on marketing communications and naming rules, notably reflecting the revised scope, the creation of categories for ‘sustainability-related financial products’, and consistent with the de-prioritisation lis t . Namely, sustainability -re lated claims in names and marketing communications would only be allowed for categorised products, w ith the exception of non-categorised products under Article 9a that would be able to make such claims in marketing communications but not their names . In addition, amendments to Article 13 incorporate disclosure requirements from Regulation (EU) 2024/3005 for financial market participants that include ESG rating s in their marketing documentations, ensuring that information on such ratings is available as part of the website disclosures.  (15) Amendment of Article 14 to reflect the revised scope and preclude additional national level requirements in order to avoid that these would go beyond information requirements and criteria for ‘sustainability-related financial products ’ in th e revised Regulation and cause fragmentation in the internal market .  (16) Change to Article 15 to reflect the revised scope .  (17) Addition of o ptional exemptions in Article 17 for specific types of products , notably of the closed-end ed type created before the entry into application of the revised Regulation as well as a clarification that the creation of categories for ‘sustainability-related financial products’ is without prejudice to labelling schemes with additional features in terms of transparency , governance and other requirements .  (18) Revision to Article 18 (reporting by ESAs) to reflect the revised subject matter and scope of the Regulation .  (19) Consequential targeted changes to Article 18a (European single access point) .  (20) Changes to the review clause (Article 19) to reflect the revised subject matter and scope of the Regulation .  (21) Addition of new Articles 19a , 19b and 19c (transitional provisions for insurance and pension products which are n ot affected by the ESMA fund name guidelines , and Commission empowerment s to specify the conditions for investments to contribute to given transition-related or sustainability-related objectives or to integrate sustainability factors for the categorisation of financial products as sustainability-related products , and the disclosure requirements for these categorised financial products via delegated acts ) .  Article 2 amends Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 notably by specifying disclosures to be included in the key information document for sustainability-related products to indicate which category they fall under.  Article 3 repeals Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288, containing implementing measures adopted under the current SFDR, as from the date of application of the revised Regulation.  2025/0361 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 on sustainability-related disclosures in the financial services sector (SFDR), Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 on key information documents for packaged retail and insurance-based investment products (PRIIPs) and repealing Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288  (Text with EEA relevance)  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 46 ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) The March 2018 Action Plan on Financing Sustainable Growth 47 set out a series of steps to help mobilise private capital toward s more sustainable economic practices and improved sustainability-related risk management in the financial sector , in the wake of , notably, the Paris Agreement 48 on climate change and the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 49 . Among the ensuing actions, the Commission proposed, and co-legislators a dopted Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 of the European Parliament and of the Council , 50 to improve transparency on the consideration of sustainability risks and factors by financial market participants in financial services and financial products offered to investors.  (2) The Communication on the European Green Deal 51 recalled the importance of ensuring the mobilisation of private finance towards the obj ective of transforming “ the EU into a fair and prosperous society, with a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy where there are no net emissions of greenhouse gases in 2050 and where economic growth is decoupled from resource use ” . The steps taken pursuant to the Green Deal have consistently affirmed the important role of private finance in helping to achiev e climate neutrality by 2050 in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 of the European Parliament and of the Council 52 , specific sectoral sustainability targets in th at context 53 , and the objectives of the REPowerEU plan 54 to accelerate the development of secure and sustainable energy in the U nion and reduce dependency on imported fossil fuels . Commission analyses ha ve consistently highlighted the magnitude of investments needed to achieve the EU’s climate objectives: over the 2030 – 2050 period, approximately EUR 650 b illio n (in 2023 EUR) will have to be allocated yearly for the transition of the energy system alone across a variety of scenarios. In that context, u nlocking and facilitating sustainability-oriented priv ate f unds is critical for the Union to properly contribute financially to the New Collective Quantified Goal set at COP 29 and the additional climate finance goal to mobilise USD 1 , 3 t rillio n a year from 2035, to boost its resilience in the face of climate change 55 and to support the plan for EU competitiveness and decarbonisation ( The Clean Industrial Deal ) 56 . It is also aligned with efforts to bo ost the defence industry of the Union 57 by ensuring that the sustainable finance framework does not prevent capital from be ing directed towards defence-related activities , and help contribute to deliver ing a more integrated single market for savings and investments to support economic growth , innovation and competitiveness in the Union 58 .  (3) Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 has been instrumental in improving transparency as regards the opportunities and risks in investments supporting or integrating diverse sustainability-oriented aims and considerations . Financial market participants have a common set of principles and requirements for the provision of sustainability-related information regarding financial products and services they offer. R egulation (EU) 2019/2088 benefitted i nvestors in terms of a more structured framework for how th at information is presented to them, helping competition, choice and comparability between financial products and services with sustainability-related features and aims , even if not to the full of its potential . National competent authorities in charge of monitoring compliance of financial market participants with the requirements of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 have set up practices in relation to risks of greenwashing and developed a more common supervisory framework for their oversight.  (4) Regulation (EU) 2019/2088, however, has been marked by implementation challenges both for financial market participants and for investors. A comprehensive assessment under Article 19 of the Regulation has found that, while its objectives remain broadly supported, the Regulation’s implementation is associated with considerable complexity and cost s for financial market participants . In addition, the information provided to end-investors has not, on the whole, been sufficiently clear and effective in helping those end-investors understand and compare diverse sustainability-related financial products and services offered to them. Disclosures to investors under Articles 8 and 9 of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 have also been used by the market in a misleading way to categorise financial products as sustainable despite the lack of criteria that could fit this purpose . D isclosures under th o se Articles have also been marked by varying interpretation s and implementation practices , which led to in sufficient clarity for end- investors. In addi tion, diverging interpretations by national competent authorities also emerged and supervisory practices and expectations have been impacted by the need to adapt to the introduction of new common guidelines for the use of environmental, social and governance terms in the names of investment funds (“ESMA guidelines on funds names”) 59 . Th o se implementation challenges have led to undue costs and burdens for the financial sector of the Union compared to international competit ors, to a lack of investor protection and risks of greenwashing, and to differing national requirements and supervisory practices that are at odds with the integrity of the single market. Overall, the challenges are seen to limit the effectiveness of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 in exploit ing the potential of the single market to mobilise and allocate private finance for the sustainable prosperity of the Union .  (5) Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 is part of the wider sustainable finance framework, elements of which are undergoing targeted amendments to simplify , streamline and reduce the burden of sustainability-related disclosures and requirements on U nion undertakings . Th o se amendments should ensure a more cost-effective delivery of the overall ambition of the European Green Deal while not undermining its agreed policy objectives 60 . As part of that wider sustainable finance framework, Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 should also be reviewed commensurately . Th at is why its revi sion has been included among the simplification initiatives of the Commission in the Mission Letter to the Commissioner for Financial Services and the Savings and Investments Union 61 and in the 2025 Commission Work Programme 62 . The objectives of the revi sion are to overcome the shortcoming s associated with the implementation of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 , to significantly simplify administrative burdens in a coherent way with the rest of the U nion sustainable finance framework , and to help i nvestors efficiently understand and compare sustainability- related financial products.  (6) Within th at context, it is for the benefit of both end- investors and financial market participants to alleviate specific burdens flowing from Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 on financial market participants , and to formalise a comprehensive categorisation regime for financial products making sustainability-related claims . Th ose categories are to set up a clea r system according to which sustainability-related financial products should be clustered, in accordance with how th ose products claim to end-investors to pursue or achieve specific sustainability-related objectives or to integrate the consideration of specific sustainability-related factors. To harmonise the implementation and supervisory practices and further protect end-investors against greenwashing and misleading claims, t hose categories should rely on a clear set of criteria .  (7) It is necessary to adjust the scope of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 and to adjust certain definitions there in to reflect th o se objectives. Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 should continue to require financial market participants to disclose how they consider sustainability risks affect the financial products they offer to investors . Beyond these elemen t s , Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 should , however, focus exclusively on the specific requirements and associated disclosure s applicable to financial market participants which manufacture, manage or make available sustainability-related financial products , particularly those that reference sustainability-related elements in their names or marketing documentation to end- investors . F inancial advisers providing investment advice do not manufacture or manage sustainability-related financial products, nor do they make such products available to investors. For that reason, financial advisors providing investment advice should be carved out of the scope of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 altogether . Their role is rather as distributors to identify the products made available by financial market participants that match their clients’ sustainability preferences . The rules for distributors should therefore duly reflect the changes introduced by this Regulation , especially the categorisation regime for financial products making sustainability-related claims . The same applies to the service of portfolio management , consisting of managing portfolios of financial instruments in accordance with mandates given by clients on a discretionary client-by-client basis and which are thus not designed and marketed the same way as products identified for certain target markets.  (8) The definition in Article 2, point (17), of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 of sustainable investment has generated a considerable number of practical implementation challenges and concerns, queries to supervisors about interpretation and their expectations , and wide divergence in practical application . Practitioners also perceive duplication and coherence issues with comparable concepts laid down elsewhere in th e sustainable finance framework but which have a slightly different meaning, including those laid down in Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council 63 , and undue constraints for investments targeting the transition of undertakings or economic activities toward s sustainability in accordance with the policy outlined in the Commission Recommendation (EU) 2023/1435 in 2023 64 . At the same time, the definition of sustainable investment in Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 is used by financial market participants in the design of financial products and the communication with end-investors . The practical application of the term should thus be facilitated by deleting the definition of sustainable investment , thus overcoming the uncertainty in aligning practices with it , and instead embedding the underlying concept s in a simplified form in the concrete requirements for the associated categor y of sustainability-related financial products . That would ensure continuity, simplified application and improved certainty for financial market participants. Therefore, the concepts of contribution to an environmental and social objective , of do not significant harm, and of good governance practices should continue to be reflected in the criteria of the relevant categories.  (9) T o encourage investments contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation, the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, the transition to a circular economy, to pollution prevention and control, and the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems , e nvironmental objective s of sustainability related financial products should be defined according to Article 9 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852. S ocial objective s of sustainability related financial products should be understood as includ ing the principles of the European Pillar of Social Rights 65 and the Sustainable Development Goals .  (10) The proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directives (EU) 2022/2464 and (EU) 2024/1760 66 aims at an overall simplification and burden-reduction of sustainability disclosures and , focus their requirements on the largest companies . That same aim justifies focussing the scope of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 on sustainability-related financial products and on the financial market participants which manufacture, manage or make those products available to investors. In addition, Directive (EU) 2022/2464 already sets horizontal entity level disclosures of sustainability information covering all sectors. T herefore , the deletion of the specific requirements for financial market participants to make disclosures on their consideration of adverse impacts in their investment decisions at the level of the entity ensures no duplicat ion in disclosure requirements for entities also in scope of Directive (EU) 2022/2464.  (11) Financial market participants should not be prohibited from referring to information on sustainability aspects of an ancillary nature in the regulatory disclosures related to financial products even if not categorised as sustainability-related financial products. Such information should be fair, clear and not misleading. However, to protect investors and distinguish clearly between non-categorised and categorised financial products, such information should not constitute a prominent element in those disclosures and should not feature in the name or marketing communications of such financial products. In addition, for financial products that are categorised as sustainability-related financial products, financial market participants should ensure that the claims in the regulatory , marketing documentations and names of their sustainability- related financial products are consistent with the category under which they fall and their strategies.  (12) Building on the feedback received during the targeted and open public consultations, the technical workshops and roundtables, the Commission expert group’ reports and the call for evidence, as well as evidence of investor preferences in diverse consumer studies, there is a need to set up EU categories for products making sustainability-related claims . Such categories are called for to address the current misuse of the Article 8 and 9 disclosures and to harmonise at EU level the implementation and supervisory practices for products making sustainability-related claims. Such categories should rely on clear criteria to combat greenwashing, facilitate end-investors understanding of products’ sustainability-related strategies and objectives, and allow for an efficient distribution system based on investors’ sustainability preferences. Feedback favours the creation of three categories which should be distinguished in terms of their claims. The sustainable category should cover products claiming to invest in companies, assets, activities or projects that are already sustainable or pursue a particular objective related to sustainability factors, including environmental or social objective s. The transition category should cover products claiming to invest in companies, assets, activities or projects that are on a credible path to sustainability or that pursue particular environmental or social transition-related objectives. The ESG basics category should cover products claiming to integrate other sustainability considerations beyond sustainability risks in their investment strategy. This approach would also be consistent with recent regulatory guidance by the European Securities and Markets Authority 67 . These c laims by financial products are consistent with the notion of ‘environmental claims’ under Directive 2005/29/EC 68 (Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, as amended by Directive (EU) 2024/825 as regards empowering consumers for the green transition 69 ). Consistent with Article 3(4) of Directive 2005/29/EC, requirements under that Directive are met by proper application of the requirements of this Regulation.  (13) Such categories should help distributors identify the products that match their clients’ sustainability preferences and perform their target market assessment and should therefore be reflected in the rules applicable under Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/565 70 , C ommission Delegated Directive (EU) 2017/593 71 , and Commission Delegated Regulations (EU) 2017/2358 72 and (EU) 2017/2359 73 . This would provide end-investors with a clear understanding of the main features and ambitions of sustainability-related products.  (14) To help comparability and boost integrity, a minimum portion of 70% of investments by financial products in each category should be made in accordance with the sustainability-related claim, i.e. the objective that is pursued or the sustainability-related considerations that are applied . Financial market participants should be allowed to freely allocate t he remaining investments based on diversification, hedging or liquidity needs. The se remaining investments should not contradict the sustainability-related claims of the financial product. The full implementation of an investment strategy for a given financial product can take a certain period of time, especially for alternative or private assets. That period of time is communicated in pre-contractual documents. The percentage of investments necessary to meet the objectives of the product may not be immediately reached during that phase-in period. The percentage should be attained at the latest at the expiry of the phase-in period. The 70% threshold would mean an increase in ambition compared to the 50% minimum portion of ‘sustainable investment’ required for funds using a sustainability-related term in their names under the ESMA guidelines on funds ’ names. It is also considered to allow for continuity with the rule of having 80% of investments made in accord ance with the ESG claim pursued with the fund name under th o se guidelines , considering that the conditions for the 70% threshold would be stricter than the current 80% under the ESMA guidelines ( i. e. new conditions for investments to be deemed as contributing to a sustainability or transition related objectives or as integrating sustainability-related considerations ) . Finally , it allows for sufficient margin for hedging investments, and is aligned with other international investment labels, which would facilitate international convergence. To guide financial market participants and provide them with certainty, specific investment approaches for financial products should be identified per category, but without excluding other possible approaches in each case under the condition that these provide for the same level of sustainability-related ambition. Findings from recent evaluations show that there is no ‘one size fits all’ on how to granularly specify what a positive contribution to a sustainability objective or transition should be. Th at is mainly due to the wide variety of assets, strategies, sustainability objectives or factors that exist in the current market. A closed list of granular criteria for contribution would therefore res trict the investment universe too much and risk hinder ing innovati ve practices . Instead, the list of possible approaches should aim at identifying robust existing sustainability standards and encouraging their use . T he 70% threshold should focus on ensuring harmonised levels of contribution rather than granularly specify the nature of the contribution for each category. Specific disclosures on the chosen approach to contribution should be given to end-investors. Financial m arket participants should measure their contribution , the compliance with the strategy and the progress toward s the sustainability objective, through appropriate sustainability-related indicators and disclose th ose indicators . A list of voluntary indicators should be developed for this purpose. Such indicators should build on the indicators referred to in Annex I of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288 and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2772 , and on information disclosed by companies , ensuring , to the extent appropriate, continuity with current market practices under this Regulation. T his would encourage harmonisation and comparability in the way financial market participants measure and disclose their contribution to an objective .  (15) The criteria for these categories should also simplify the way financial products today using the sustainable investment definition are required to manage principal adverse impacts on environmental or social objective s . The current approach mandates financial market participants to consider the principal adverse impact indicators on sustainability factors , currently set out in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288 74 . Stakeholders ’ f eedback highlights that this approach has not led to a robust or comparable mechanism to ensure no harm. Therefore, the current approach should be replaced by mandating financial market participants to apply a common set of clear exclusions covering practices and sectors which are commonly agreed to be most harmful and to identify and disclose the principal adverse impacts of their investments on sustainability factors. These should include, where relevant, adverse impacts on climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation, the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, the transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and control, and the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems . Financial market participants should also disclose any actions taken to address the identified principal adverse impacts. In the specific context of this framework, t his would ensure a comparable and clear approach to ensure no harm. Such approach has been considered successful and effective under the implementation of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/1818. Such exclusions should also ensure , to the extent possible, continuity with the existing regulatory framework, including with the exclusions laid down in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/1818 and in the ESMA guidelines on funds names and also rely on data available from investee companies or data that can be reasonably estimated by financial market participants . Such exclusions should reflect politically agreed environment al and social goals.  (16) The transition category should consist of financial products that aim to support the transition of undertakings, economic activities and other assets towards sustainability, or contribute to such tr ansition . This category aims at providing such products with disclosures and criteria which accurately reflect transition strategies and address t he current implementation challenges arising from the lack of recognition of transition financ e in the definition of sustainable investment in Article 2, point (17), of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 . Such challenges include difficulties for financial market participants wanting to pursue and disclose transition -related stra tegies as well as confusion and lack of appropriate disclosures for end-investors interested in investing in products with transitional objective. This category should therefore bolster the visibility, transparency and integrity of financial products which invest in the transition of undertakings, economic activities, or other assets towards better environmental or social performance, or that contribute to the environmental or social transition. Th is category should therefore capture financial products with a high level of transition ambition, selecting notably investments based on proven standards and tools, including centred on strategies tracking or replicating EU Climate Transition benchmarks (CTB) or EU Paris-aligned benchmarks (PAB) in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 of the European Parliament and of the Council 75 , on investing in transitional economic activities or in undertakings investing their capital expenditures in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2020/852 , or o n investing in undertakings or economic activities that commit to future improvements through credible transition plans or science-based targets . This category should also capture financial products with a transition-related performance set at the level of the portfolio, such as reducing portfolio financed emission over time , under the condition that the underlying investments are coherent with the transition-related objective of the products . To ensure a meaningful contribution to the international and European climate goals, financial products which pursue a climate change mitigation objective should align their ambition with th at in the Paris Agreement and in Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 , in particular for financial market participants relying on transition plans and science-based targets from companies or projects , or when pursuing a sustainability-related engagement strategy with investee companies . This category should also exclude activities which are commonly agreed to be harmful to the environment and society, while giving investors the possibility to invest in companies at different starting points in their transition efforts. These exclusions should ensure sufficient alignment with the ones defined under the EU Climate Benchmarks and introduced by the ESMA guidelines on funds names for all funds using certain ESG terms in their names, including ‘transition’ -related terms . They should cover activities related to prohibited weapons as defined in the upcoming amendment to Regulation (EU) 2020/1818 76 , the cultivation and production of tobacco, violations of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) principles or the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises (OECD MNEs), and hard coal and lignite. This category should also exclude companies developing new projects linked to oil or gaseous fuels, and companies developing new projects, or without a plan to phase-out from, hard coal or lignite for power generation. Moreover, like products falling under the sustainable category , products falling under the transition category should identify and disclose the principal adverse impacts of their investments on sustainability factors, and explain any actions taken to address those impacts.  (17) The ESG basics category should consist of financial products the strategy or design of which is based on selected sustainability factors . Feedback received during the targeted and open public consultations, the technical workshops and roundtables, the Commission expert group’ reports and the call for evidence, as well as evidence of investor preferences in diverse consumer studies, highlights the need to cater for such financial products to allow for innovative sustainability approaches and for end-investor preferences which include products avoiding harmful investments. The criteria should cater for investments which do not specifically pursue a sustainability or transition related objective but integra te sustainability factors in their investment strategies through credible sustainability-related approaches. The criteria should list several approaches which could be adopted by financial market participants, such as outperformance of the investment universe of reference benchmarks measured by an ESG rating or a sustainability indicator, a combination of sustainable or transition standards , as well as investments that favour undertakings or economic activities with a proven positive track record on certain sustainability factors. This category should also exclude activities which are commonly agreed to be harmful to the environment and society in alignment with the ones defined under the EU Climate Benchmarks and introduced by the ESMA guidelines on funds names for all funds using ESG terms , but ‘sustainab ility -related terms or ‘impact’ - related ones . They should cover activities related to prohibited weapons as defined in the upcoming amendment to Regulation (EU) 2020/1818 , the cultivation and production of tobacco, violations of the UNGC principles or OECD MNEs , and hard coal and lignite.  (18) The sustainable category should consist of financial products that invest in companies , assets or activities that are sustainable or that pursu e or positive ly contribut e to environmental and / or social objectives . This category should capture financial products with a high level of ambition in th at regard, selecting notably investments based on proven standards and tools , including centred on strategies replicating or managed in reference to an EU Paris-aligned benchmarks in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 of the European Parliament and of the Council 77 , on invest ing in sustainable economic activities in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2020/852, on in vesting in instruments issued in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2023/2631 of the European Parliament and of the Council 78 , and on investments in relation to operations benefiting from a Union budgetary guarantee or financial instruments under Union progr ammes pursuing environmental or social objectives. Accordingly , the exclusions for f inancial products in th is category should extend beyond those for the other two categories and encompass activities where the value chain is associated with fossil fuels , including the expansion of fossil fuels . In particular, t he exclusions should include the ones of the transition and ESG basics category, in addition to activities linked to oil fuels, gaseous fuels , electricity generation with a GHG intensity of more than 100 g CO2 e/kWh . This category should also exclude companies developing new projects linked to oil or gaseous fuels, and companies developing new projects, or without a plan to phase-out from, hard coal or lignite for power generation. Moreover, beyond these exclusions, products falling under the sustainable category should identify and disclose the principal adverse impacts of their investments on sustainability factors, and explain any actions taken to address those impacts. This requirement would complement the common binary exclusions and ensure that any other principal adverse impacts on sustainability factors are identified, disclosed, and potentially addressed. It would bring accurate transparency on adverse impacts, therefore allowing end-investors to understand the potential harm of such products, while bringing more legal clarity on the required obligation to financial market participants than the current principle of ‘consideration’ of principal adverse impact indicators . I ndicators should be developed that build on the current principal adverse impact indicators referred to in Annex I to Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1888 and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2772 for voluntary use by financial market participants when complying with the identification and disclosure of principal adverse impacts. However, financial market participants should have the flexibility to disclose these principal adverse impacts using a different approach, such as different indicators or a qualitative explanation of such impacts and actions, if it fits better the nature of the impact identified or addressed. This flexibility on how to identify the impacts should allow them to focus on the impacts which are actually relevant for their products depending on the assets, strategies and objectives pursued. This requirement would align to a certain degree with existing criteria in other international frameworks while ensuring that the EU rules remain more ambitious including through the implementation of common binary exclusions.  (19) To encourage the use of well-established EU standards, the sustainable and transition category should provide for appropriate treatment and legal cert ainty for products relying on the EU Taxonomy and the EU Climate Benchmarks. Products replicating or managed in reference to an EU Paris-aligned benchmark should be considered as products qualifying under the sustainable and transition category . Similarly, products replicating or managed in reference to an EU Climate Transition benchmark should be considered as products qualifying under the transition category. In addition, products with a proportion of T axonomy-aligned investment equal or higher than 15% should be considered product s complying with the contribution criteria of the sustainable and transition category. The latter would still need to apply the exclusions mandated under the category they wish to comply with on the portion of the portfolio that is not aligned with the EU Taxonomy. Based on the opinion of the Platform for Sustainable Finance, the 15% threshold provides for sufficient incentive for products to aim for an ambition portion of investment in Taxonomy-aligned economic activities while being aligned with the current state of the market. More specifically, this threshold should be attainable by about half of the current investment funds disclosing under Article 9 of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 . The threshold should be subject to review 36 months after the date of application to continue to align it with the state of the broader economy and reflect any development under the EU Taxonomy in order to ensure it provides the right incentive. These provisions aim at simplifying the implementation of the categories, enhancing the coherence of the EU sustainable finance framework, and encouraging the use of these EU labels and standards by providing certainty to their users.  (20) Within the categories of products with sustainab ility and transition -related objectives, r ecognition should be given to the practice of impact investing . Acknowledging the specific characteristics of impact investing, including the objective of intentionality and target ing measurable change in s pecific pre-defined environmental or social areas with an upfront theory of change and with reporting on the outcomes , helps to promote the contribution which impact investing can make to addressing various environmental and social need s. Specific disclosures should therefore apply to financial product s that are categorised as sustainability-related financial products with sustainability or transition-related objectives and that pursue specific impact s as understood for these type s of investment practices . T he use of the term ‘impact’ in the names of financial products should be restricted accordingly .  (21) Pre-contractual and periodic disclosures for financial products that are categorised as sustainability-related product should contain all relevant information about the objective, strategy, and investment approaches to comply with the 70% requirement, chosen indicators for measuring performance, compliance with applicable exclusions, and relevant data sources used to inform the design, compliance and measurement of the criteria applicable to the financial product. Financial products falling under the sustainable and transition category that pursu e an environmental objective should disclose whether and the extent to which they use the EU Taxonomy as one of their investment approaches, to meet the 70% requirement. This disclosure requirement on the use of the EU Taxonomy will enhance comparability across financial products with environmental objectives. In addition, disclosures on any ESG ratings included in market documentations of sustainability-related products should be included in websites disclosures , as per requirements under Regulation (EU) 2024/3005. These disclosures should allow end-investors to understand the specific characteristics of each sustainability-related financial products, compare them and understand whether they fit their sustainability preferences , and facilitate the provision of financial and insurance advice .  (22) There are currently no comprehensive metrics for gauging the sustainability of general - purpose sovereign, sub-sovereign and supranational debt issuances . I nvestments in such debt issuances should therefore be excluded from counting toward s the contribution of financial products to sustainability or transition related objective s . W ithout affecting the treatment or inclusion of those debt issuances among investments by financial products in general, investments in such debt issuances should be excluded from qualifying for the numerator of the portion of investment that needs to be reached by financial products that are categorised under the sustainable and transition categories. However, financial market participants should be allowed to includ e th ose debt issuance s in the numerator of financial products that are categorised under the ESG basics category , using available methodologies that are appropriate to assess the sustainability of those investments for th at purpose. Further, the exclusions regarding investments which financial products that are categorised as sustainability-related financial products cannot make , apply to companies, and not to sovereigns, sub-sovereigns and supra - nationals. Those exclusions therefore do not restrict investments in debt issuances by sovereigns, sub-sovereigns and supra - nationals, which can thus feature in the denominator of those financial products, including notably debt issuances by Union Member States, Union-level bodies and other public sector bodies not subject to any applicable Union-level financial sanctions. In contrast, investments in financial instruments issued by sovereigns, sub-sovereigns and supra - nationals , where the use of proceeds is known , where th o se instruments support specific sustainability aims , and provided that those financial instruments do not directly or indirectly fund activities that are excluded from investments by financial products that are categorised as sustainability-related financial products , can be included in the numerator of all categorised financial products. This balanced approach should allow sustainability-related financial products to continue to fund public projects and activities related to sustainability, while providing safeguards to potential greenwashing risks. Financial market participants should ensure that investments in public sector debt by categorised financial products are consistent with the stated sustainability-related objective or strategy o f those products to avoid greenwashing risks and be aligned with end-investors ’ expectations .  (23) T he creation of categories for sustainability-related financial products requires provisions that determine how products that are exposed to categorised products should assess their eligibility to a category and if they do not qualify for a category , how such non-categorised financial products which invest in categorised financial products should disclose information about those investments . In order to assess the eligibility to a category, financial market participants should be able to rely on the information disclosed regarding categorised financial products and combine it with the information on their other investment s . In cases where a financial market participant uses the services of an entity regulated to provide portfolio management services, the financial market participant should be able to rely on the information provided by this entity which can be mandated to invest in accordance wit h the criteria for categorised products by its client . In case where investments of those products in categorised products reach the 70% threshold for their portfolio, and where compliance with other criteria, notably exclusion criteria, is also ensured, these products could be considered to qualify as categorised products themselves. This assessment should build on information on the underlying categorised products (e.g.  either the minimum investment required for categorised products under this Regulation, or the actual investment if available) and information disclosed by portfolio managers. Provided the appropriate exclusions are met in each case, only products that meet the 70% threshold by investing solely in sustainable products could be considered sustainable, while those investing across categories would fall either within the transition (if mixing sustainable or transition products) or ESG basics (if mixing products from any of the three). For financial products that do not qualify for a category but invest in categorised financial products, in order t o ensure comparability, disclosure s should include how much th ese financial products have invest ed in financial products that are categorised as sustainability-related financial products , as well as in portfolios managed for clients on a discreti onary basis in accordance with the criteria for categorised products , and how much in non-categorised products . For this purpose , financial market participants should be able to rely on the information disclosed regarding categorised financial products as well as the information disclosed by the authorised entity in change or providing the service of portfolio management . Th at should help financial market participants managing, manufacturing or making available such products inform their clients on the sustainability-related elements of these products in a more harmonised way , while allowing them to rely on the information provided for the underlying categorised products and without requiring them to separately verify th is information. Those non-categorised products should however not be able to use sustainability-related terms in their names , that are reserved for categorised products, but should be able to include sustainability-related claims in the ir marketing communications , provided they are clear, fair and not misleading, and accurately reflect the information they disclose on the relative shares of investments in categorised products and in other assets.  (24) T he wide range of potential investable assets for financial products that can be categorised as sustainability-related financial products means that t here will continue to be certain data gaps in relation to sustainability data from investees and other assets . It is th erefore appropriate to formalise and improve transparency about the use of estimates by financial market participants , without however imposing new requirements on third party sustainability data providers. Notably, proportionate steps should be introduced whereby financial market participants are to document their use of data sources and their use of external and in-house estimates and are to provide their clients with information on such use upon request.  (25) T o help promote the functioning of the single market for sustainability-related financial products, as part of deeper and more integrated financial markets to mobilise savings and investments across the Union in support of competitiveness, environmental and social objectives , Member States and national competent authorities should not set or apply additional requirements as regards the consideration and disclosures of sustainability risks , or as regards the criteria, procedures, and disclosures concerning the categorisation of sustainability-related financial products .  (26) Where existing financial products are closed to new investors and would no longer be offered to investors after the date of application of this Regulation , for reasons of proportionality f inancial market participants should be able opt out of applying this Regulation to those financial products .  (27) T he power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission to allow for the specification of the conditions for investments to contribute to given transition-related or sustainability-related objectives or to integrate sustainability factors for the categorisation of financial products as sustainability-related products , and disclosure templates for such financial products. It is of particular importance that the Commission carr ies out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including with the European Supervisory Authorities established by Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council 79 , Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council 80 , and Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council 81 , and with the Member States Expert Group on sustainable finance , where appropriate. The European Supervisory Authorities should also support the Commission in conducting appropriate testing of consumers and investors to inform how product distributors best identify the products that match clients’ sustainability preferences under Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/565 , C ommission Delegated Directive (EU) 2017/593 , Commission Delegated Regulations (EU) 2017/2358 and (EU) 2017/2359 , based on the categorisation, and ensure that associated investor- facing details are easily understandable in all official languages of the Union . T hose consultations should be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making 82 . In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council should receive all documents at the same time as Member States’ experts, and their experts should systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.  (28) In order to ensure unform conditions for the implementation of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 as amended by this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council 83  (29) The amendments to Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 should be reflected in Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council 84 . Notably, the k ey i nformation document accompanying products categorised under Regulation (EU) 2019/2088, as amended, should contain information on the category , a description of its objective , and relevant indicators.  (30) This Regulation adapts i nformation requirements related to the degree to which financial products invest in sustainability-related activities, including activities that contribute to an environmental objective as set out in Article 9 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852, in light of the revised scope and subject matter. Given that the definition of the term ‘sustainable investment’ should be deleted and given the changes introduced by this Regulation to the disclosure requirements, the detailed disclosure requirements laid down in Articles 5 to 7 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 become moot.  (31) To monitor the implementation of this Regulation and to monitor and possibly cater for market evolution and innovation, the European Supervisory Authorities should take stock of the market for sustainability-related financial products and deliver a report to the Commission on best practices every two years. This would allow for both encouraging best practices and monitor the need for any adjustment for the underlying criteria of the sustainability categories.  (32) Financial market participants shall start applying this Regulation 12 months after the date of application of this Regulation for IBIP s , pension products, pension schemes and PEPP s . These products are not subject to the ESMA guidelines on funds names and therefore will require more time to implement the new underlying criteria, especially to implement the exclusions.  (33) Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely to strengthen protection for end investors and improve disclosures to them, including in cases of cross‐border purchases by end investors, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the need to lay down uniform disclosure requirements, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives .  (34) Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 and Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 should therefore be amended accordingly ,  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Article 1 Amendments to Regulation (EU) 2019/2088  Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 is amended as follows:  (1) Article 1 is replaced by the following:  ‘Article 1 Subject matter  This Regulation lays down harmonised rules for financial market participants on:  (a) transparency with regard to the provision of sustainability-related information , including the integration of sustainability risks with respect to the investment decision-making process of those financial market participants and the financial products they offer to investors ;  (b) the categorisation of, and transparency with regard to , financial products as sustainability-related financial products. ’;  (2) Article 2 is amended as follows:  (a) point (1) is amended as follows:  (i) point (b) is deleted;  (ii) point (j) is deleted;  (b) points ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) are deleted;  (c) p oint ( 11 ) is deleted;  (d) in point ( 12 ) , point (a) is deleted ;  (e) points ( 16 ) and ( 17 ) are deleted;  (f) points ( 20 ) and ( 21 ) are deleted;  (g) the following  point s ( 2 5) to (28) are added : ‘ (25) ' sustainability-related financial product’ means a financial product that is categorised in accordance with Article 7, 8 or 9 ; (26) ‘sustainability-related financial product with impact’ means a financial product categorised in accordance with Article 7 or 9 that has as its objective t he generat ion of a pre-defined, positive and measurable social or environmental impact ; (27) ' public sector bodies ’ means central governments or central banks , regional governments or local authorities , multilateral development banks as referred to in Article 117 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council * 1 , and international organisations as referred to in Article 118 of that Regulation ; and (28) ‘ e nvironmental objectives’ means the objectives referred to in Article 9 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 * 2 , namely climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation, the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, the transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and control, and the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems .’;  _________________________________________________________  * 1 Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and amending Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 ( OJ L 176, 27.6.2013, p. 1, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2013/575/oj ).  *2 Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2020 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment, and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 (OJ L 198, 22.6.2020, pp. 13, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2020/852/oj ).

Title of the proposal/initiative  Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 on sustainability-related disclosures in the financial services sector  1.2. Policy area(s) concerned  Savings and Investments Union, European Green Deal, Sustainable Finance Strategy  1.3. Objective(s)  1.3.1. General objective(s)  The first general objective is to protect the integrity of the EU single market for sustainable finance by ensuring requirements which mitigate risks of greenwashing, and to better help investors seize opportunities in sustainability-linked financial products. The second general objective is to boost the competitiveness of Europe’s financial sector by ensuring conditions which make business easier and help to deepen the single market for sustainability-linked financial products and thus to efficiently allocate capital for Europe’s sustainable prosperity. Overall, this is set to ensure a better use of the potential of the European single market for sustainable finance to contribute to funding the transition towards Europe’s sustainable prosperity and competitiveness.  1.3.2. Specific objective(s)  Specific objectives  The first specific objective is to simplify and reduce the sustainability-related administrative requirements of the SFDR for financial market participants, as well as to enhance the coherence of the framework for their operational needs. The second specific objective is to improve end-investors’ ability to understand and compare sustainability-linked financial products. The specific objectives tackle the main problems which have been identified both for financial market participants on the one hand, and for investors on the other, which inhibit their ability to, respectively, design financial products and deploy corresponding investments in an efficient and effective manner toward the EU’s sustainability, competitiveness and other strategic policy goals.  1.3.3. Expected result(s) and impact  Specify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.  Financial market participants and investors with an interest in sustainable investing are expected to benefit from a simple categorisation for all products with environmental, social and governance (ESG) objectives and features, with a common set of rules regarding ESG claims in names, marketing communication and in the distribution of such products. The categories would effectively cluster ESG financial products into three groupings depending on their objectives and levels of ambition. End-investors would be better able to grasp whether a financial product is focused on contributing to a sustainability objective/made largely of sustainable assets, focused on helping companies to transition toward more sustainable practices, or integrating broader or lighter ESG strategies. The underlying criteria of the categories would ensure harmonised minimum ESG performance, notably against risks deemed unacceptable by the majority of sustainability-minded investors, thereby increasing investors’ protection against greenwashing risks. The regulation would be clearer and simpler to apply than today, with lower costs and risks of national gold plating. The initial one-off costs would be offset by overall burden reductions expected to reduce recurring costs over the medium to longer term. Overall, the impacts are expected to boost the integrity and scale of the EU single market for sustainable finance and encourage the efficient allocation of capital in line with the objectives of the savings and investments union.  1.3.4. Indicators of performance  Specify the indicators for monitoring progress and achievements.  To monitor progress towards meeting the specific and general objectives , the Commission would work together with established processes underway notably with the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) and the Platform for Sustainable Finance (PSF) to analyse:  The costs incurred by the industry – Supervisory authorities could survey and assess the implementation costs linked to the new categorisation system at the latest 3 years after its implementation. This assessment could also monitor the cost reductions from the reduced disclosures.  Possible occurrences of greenwashing in EU markets. – Building on existing processes, supervisory authorities could regularly continue to monitor occurrences of greenwashing, continue to oversee sustainability-related claims by products, and periodically survey investors to help assess the effectiveness of the revised SFDR as a tool against greenwashing and ensuring decision-relevant data for investors.  Capital flows to sustainable investment – Building on the work of the Platform for Sustainable Finance to monitor capital flows to sustainable investment, a targeted analysis a few years after the implementation of the regime could be carried out to assess the degree to which the categorisation system, together with the simplified disclosures, has helped boost financing toward sustainable economic activities and projects and helped lower the cost of capital linked to these.  1.4. The proposal/initiative relates to:   a new action   a new action following a pilot project / preparatory action 85   the extension of an existing action   a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action  1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative  1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative  Once agreed by co-legislators, an implementation and preparatory period would precede the entry into application of the revised SFDR framework. The transition to the new rules would be facilitated by the fact that the proposals build on existing market practices and regulatory guidance to a large degree, and allow for a further phasing-in period for financial products which are not subject to this guidance.  1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, greater effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this section 'added value of EU involvement' is the value resulting from EU action, that is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.  The need for a coherent common framework for sustainability-related disclosures for financial products across the EU was established as part of the original SFDR. The objectives remain fully valid, and enjoy broad stakeholder support. Without Union-level action to review the current regime, the challenges identified with it would persist in the shape of undue complexity and a lack of clarity regarding the sustainability-linked features of available financial products, negatively impacting their credibility and uptake.  To overcome these problems and boost the effectiveness and efficiency of the single market for sustainable finance products, the necessary simplification and adjustment of the existing SFDR framework can only be done in a coherent and effective way at EU level. Actions by Member States could, in contrast, only address some of the identified issues, but with the risk of fragmentation of the single market (diverging levels of transparency between national markets, growing disparities in investor confidence in ESG products across Member States, risks of more barriers and challenges for cross-border market participants, and further limits to the comparability of products across the single market).  Action at EU level to ensure uniform simplifications and a common set-up for the ESG-features of financial products, together with solutions to ESG data-related challenges, is more conducive to a harmonised, effective, efficient and coherent outcome across the single market, and in support of the broader strategic objectives of the Union. In short, EU level action would boost the proper functioning of the single market for sustainable finance and in addition contribute to improving transparency for investors across the Union to enable their participation in EU capital markets in general, in line with the objectives of the Savings and Investments Union.  1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past  The lessons learned from some of the challenges with the existing rules can be summarised as the need to (i) ensure a coherent implementation timeline for the updated changes, (ii) introduce clearer, simpler and more proportionate rules and concepts for the benefit of financial market participants and investors, (iii) formalise and embedding these in a framework of product categories, to help cluster available products in this way, and (iv) ensure that the revised concepts, rules and possible categories rely on ESG data that is available and/or possible to reliably estimate.  1.5.4. Compatibility with the multiannual financial framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments  The review serves the objective of helping to mobilise funds toward the competitive opportunities in the green transition and other evolving strategic priorities in line with Union objectives. As such, it can ease the pressure off public funds, which are increasingly stretched in terms of competing and new emerging priorities, to finance and catalyse funds towards sustainability objectives. Specific co-investments into relevant EU financial programmes are also encouraged under the criteria for the product categories.  1.5.5.

In contrast to the wider scope in terms of products, and greater number of datapoints (and services) covered at present, the future rules would hinge on fewer datapoints for products which integrate or embrace ESG features in their design. In order to collect the relevant data, financial market participants’ reliance on digital data collection, processing and vending platforms and their own deployment of in-house digital data management tools would be streamlined. For investors and their own deployment of digital search and comparison tools, disclosures would be more focused on the most meaningful datapoints, facilitating accessibility (and comparability) of key data. Both for financial market participants (preparers of product-data) and investors (users of product-data), the use of artificial intelligence tools, in accordance with the requirements and risk parameters of the AI Act, would be facilitated. To streamline data collection and processing, the changes are commensurate with those introduced under the ‘Omnibus I’ simplifications for sustainability data from corporates. In addition, the digital tagging of SFDR data at entity-level introduced under Article 18a of the Regulation for the purposes of the creation of a European single access point (ESAP) to help the publication of machine-readable information for investors is adjusted accordingly.  Alignment with the once-only principle  The data required for defined specific purposes for categorised sustainability-related financial products under the revised SFDR will be largely reusable between them (i.e. pre-contractual and periodic disclosures for financial market participants’ websites). The data required will principally hinge on ensuring: (a) measurable indicators to demonstrate that a sufficient portion of financial products’ investments are aligned with their stated sustainability objectives or attributes and (b) compliance with a set of mostly binary exclusions regarding sectors and activities which the products cannot invest in. The data choices for the first would largely depend on financial market participants’ design of their products, and those for the second would largely constitute a straightforward explanation to demonstrate that they do not invest in excluded activities. The revised rules also formalise and set out transparency requirements for the use of estimates for the purposes of, mostly, the first requirement, as well as reliance on external data providers. The simplified data flows facilitate it to be findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable, and to meet high-quality standards.

In addition, the Commission will develop disclosure t emplates in implementing measures envisage s for core data flows envisaged for categorised financial products under this Regulation .",,,,,,,,,,,,,"The European Commission has proposed amendments to the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) to enhance transparency and effectiveness within the EU's sustainable finance framework. Initially introduced in 2021, the SFDR aims to improve how financial products incorporate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors, helping investors make informed decisions and combat misleading sustainability claims, often termed ""greenwashing."" Despite its success in increasing ESG-characteristic financial products, the regulation has faced criticism for its complexity and the challenges financial institutions encounter in accessing reliable ESG data.

To address these issues, the Commission's proposal seeks to simplify the SFDR, reduce administrative burdens, and improve enforcement. The goal is to maintain the integrity of the EU's single market for sustainable finance by focusing on requirements that prevent greenwashing and enhance investors' ability to compare sustainability-linked financial products. This effort aligns with the European Green Deal's objectives and aims to simplify EU regulations to enhance competitiveness and efficiency. The proposal also aims to boost the competitiveness of Europe’s financial sector by making business conditions easier and deepening the single market for sustainability-linked financial products, thereby helping to allocate capital for Europe’s sustainable prosperity.

The proposal includes simplifying and reducing sustainability-related administrative and disclosure requirements for financial market participants and advisers, while enhancing the framework's coherence for operational needs. It seeks to improve end-investors' understanding and comparison of sustainability-linked financial products. The proposal integrates considerations for human rights and aims to cater to investments that integrate sustainability factors into their strategies",

CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  Union legislation should deliver its policy objectives efficiently, effectively and transparently. These longstanding principles can be traced back to the 2001 White paper on Governance ( 1 ) which put better regulation and stakeholder engagement at the heart of European policymaking. The Competitiveness Compass ( 2 ) continues the promotion of responsible law-making . It announced unprecedented efforts to simplify legislation to reignite the competitiveness of European business. Moreover, the Commission has since strengthened targets to reduce administrative costs for business (together with public authorities) and Small and Medium sized Entreprises by 25% and 35% respectively ( 3 ).  A mature body of Union environmental law now exists. The Commission takes seriously its duty to manage these laws effectively and invests heavily in reviewing ( 4 ) their application to ensure that they deliver as intended and that problematic issues are tackled early. Moreover, the Commission is committed to ‘stress-test’ all EU laws under its current term of office. The content of this proposal (and others in the ‘omnibus’ package) represents the initial fruits of the Commission’s ongoing ‘stress-testing’ in the environment area ( 5 ) built on extensive dialogue and inputs from civil society. The omnibus package addresses legislation related to the circular economy, the operation of industrial installations, the management of geospatial data, and environmental permitting.  The above legislation are crucial parts of delivering the Union’s commitment to a fair green, and digital transition and the shift towards a circular economy in particular. It is important that this legislation works well, mobilises the Union’s assets like the single market and avoids imposing unnecessary costs on business, public authorities and citizens.  This specific proposed Directive aims to reduce the administrative burden for producers established in one Member State of the Union selling their products in other Member States, in relation to the participation of these producers in the extended producer responsibility schemes in those other Member States, set up under Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 on batteries and waste batteries (the Batteries Regulation)( 6 ) and under Regulation (EU) 2025/40 on packaging and packaging waste (the Packaging Regulation) ( 7 ) .  The producer of a product placed on the market of a Member State has the responsibility to cover the costs of managing the product at its end of life (so called ‘Extended Producer Responsibility or EPR). The Waste Framework Directive sets out the minimum general requirements for extended producer responsibility while specific rules for different product groups exist in other legislation such as the Regulation on packaging and packaging waste, the Regulation on batteries and waste batteries, the Directive on electronic and electrical waste, and the Single Use Plastics Directive , as well the Directive on end-of-life vehicles (currently subject to revision under an ongoing ordinary legislative procedure) ( 8 ). Member States may also establish national rules on extended producer responsibility for other products, provided these rules comply with the minimum requirements set out in Article 8 and 8a of the Waste Framework Directive.  An authorised representative for EPR acts on behalf of an economic operator (producer) selling products in a Member State where the producer is not established or if it is established in a third country. The purpose is to ensure that producers making available products on the territory of a Member State comply with the rules on EPR so that the costs of the management of waste generated in that Member State are covered.  In the May 2025 Communication on a strategy for the single market( 9 ), the Commission highlighted the complexity of EPR rules as a major barrier in the internal market, in particular as regards the possibility or obligation for a producer to have an authorised representative for EPR in each Member State where the producer makes its products available .  This proposal would provide additional flexibility by allowing producers established in the Union and selling products in another Member State to choose whether they appoint an authorised representative for EPR. Provisions regarding the appointment of authorised representatives for EPR for producers based in third countries should remain as they currently are contained in sectoral legislation.  This proposal suspends certain provisions of two Regulations in the area of environment, waste management. Further possible modifications of those Regulations or further suspensions of their provisions are entirely outside of the scope and aims of the present proposal. The need for such modifications may be assessed, as appropriate, in the context of further stress-testing of EU environmental legislation announced in the [Chapeau Communication] and in Commission work programme 2026. The Commission will constructively engage with the co-legislators, in order to ensure that the legislative process on the present proposal fully preserves its essential object and does not distort it.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  The current proposal promotes a similar approach across circular economy/waste legislation regarding the operation of schemes for extended producer responsibility. This will facilitate the functioning of the internal market while aiding business operations.  • Consistency with other Union policies  This proposal is part of a package of measures aimed primarily at cutting red tape for economic operators. It is entirely consistent with the Commission’s policies on better regulation, and the objectives of the Competitiveness compass to promote greater competitiveness and economic resilience in the Union. The rationalisation introduced by these measures will not affect the achievement of the objectives in the concerned policy area nor the rationale of the legislative acts.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  The legal base of the proposal is 192(1) TFEU in relation to batteries and 114 TFEU in relation to packaging. This reflects the underlying legal base of the Regulations containing provisions on authorised representatives for extended producer responsibility that the proposal suspends.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  The Batteries Regulation was adopted in recognition of the expected demand for batteries in the coming years, the strategic role of batteries in the global transition towards decarbonised economies and the need to establish a functioning internal market and to avoid market distortions. As such the Batteries Regulation sets out common rules on the sustainability, performance, safety, collection, recycling and second life of batteries as well as on information about batteries for end-users and economic operators. For these reasons, the suspension of provisions of the Regulation is similarly justified on subsidiarity grounds.  Products need appropriate packaging to be protected and easy to transport from where they are produced to where they are used or consumed. Prevention of barriers on the internal market for packaging is key to promote the efficient functioning of the internal market for products. Fragmented rules and vague requirements cause uncertainty and additional cost to economic operators. For these reasons, the suspension of provisions of the Regulation is similarly justified on subsidiarity grounds.  • Proportionality  In the case of the circular economy legislation, the proposal would introduce alternative means to deliver the policy objectives of ensuring that waste products, batteries or packaging are appropriately managed at the end of their useful life. These respond to the concerns of producers operating across Member States.  • Choice of the instrument  A proposal for Regulation is the appropriate choice of instrument given that the underlying legislation that the proposal suspends are Regulations.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  Revisions of the Batteries Regulation and the Packaging Regulation were recently adopted by the Legislator based on Commission’s proposals that were supported by impact assessments. An evaluation cannot be carried out at this stage as too little time has passed, and too little practical experience was gained for a standard evaluation to be useful at this point in time.  • Stakeholder consultations  The staff working document accompanying this proposal provides more information on the various consultation activities that have been undertaken to support the preparation of this proposal. The key consultation activities are summarised below.  The following consultation activities have been carried out to prepare this omnibus proposal:  – A call for evidence 10 for the environmental omnibus open for feedback from 22 July 2025 to 10 September 2025.  – A high-level roundtable on simplifying environmental laws on 2 October 2025.  The call for evidence on environmental simplification drew a lot of attention . The Commission published a call for evidence on the environmental simplification package on the Have-Your-Say website: Simplification of administrative burdens in environmental legislation . The feedback period was from 22 July 2025 till 10 September 2025. All feedback is published on the Have-Your-Say website.  There were 190 998 contributions to the call for evidence, of which 189 751 (99.3%) came from citizens. 1 247 (0.7%) contributions came from organisations other than citizens, including businesses and business associations, non-governmental organisations (environmental and other), public authorities and academics. 622 attachments, mainly position papers, were attached to these submissions, which often included specific suggestions.  From a business perspective, there is support for less burdensome regulation that leaves business with flexibility to deliver both growth and sustainable production. There is a perception of administrative obligations that are too prescriptive, and do not provide value added.  On the side of civil society, there is support for a simplification that makes it easier to protect the environment and social standards and avoid deregulation, for example by removing redundancies and avoiding excessively detailed regulations. There is however concern that efforts to simplify regulations could undermine environmental protections. Citizens urged the EU to focus on enforcing existing laws rather than creating new simplifications.  The Commission is currently preparing an impact assessment to support the preparation of the Circular Economy Act in 2026. This assessment will utilise ongoing consultation activities that will also cover simplification of existing (waste and circular economy-related) legislation, and particularly EPR related legislation.  • Collection and use of expertise  The Commission contracted an external service provider to provide expertise related to this proposal. In particular, the contractor has screened the known body of environmental laws to identify reporting and other administrative obligations together with potential to simplify these obligations. In addition, the contractor has provided assistance in quantifying the reductions in costs of possible measures to simplify provisions in the omnibus package. All information provided by the contractor will be published.  • Impact assessment  An impact assessment has not been prepared primarily because the proposal is highly specific with little choice available to remedy the underlying issues. A staff working document does however accompany this proposal. It justifies the content of the proposal and presents quantitative information about the expected impacts. It also presents the views and inputs of stakeholders which the Commission has received.  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  Under the regulatory fitness and performance programme (REFIT), the Commission ensures that its legislation is fit for purpose, targeted to the needs of stakeholders, and minimises burdens while achieving its objectives. This proposal is therefore part of, and fully coherent with, the REFIT programme in so far as it attempts to simplify administrative procedures related to the appointment of authorised representatives for extended producer responsibility and reduce unnecessary costs for producers.  • Fundamental rights  The proposal has no adverse impact on fundamental rights as enshrined in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights as it solely impacts the appointment of an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  Not applicable.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  Given the very specific nature of the proposal, there is no need for implementation plans to guide the application of the new provisions. Existing monitoring and reporting provisions in the affected Regulation will continue.  • Explanatory documents (for directives)  Not applicable.  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  Article 1 suspends the application of Article 56(3) of Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 until January 2035.  Article 2 suspends the application of Article 45(3) of Regulation (EU)2025/40 until January 2035.  2025/0395 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  suspending the application of the rules on the appointment of an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility for batteries and waste batteries and packaging and packaging waste  (Text with EEA relevance)  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 192(1) and 114 thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 11 ,  Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions 12 ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) The political guidelines for the Commission’s 2024-2029 term 13 point to the goal of simplifying, consolidating and codifying legislation to eliminate any overlaps and contradictions while maintaining high standards and staying the course on the goals set out in the European Green Deal .  (2) In its Communication entitled ‘A simpler and faster Europe: Communication on implementation and simplification’, 14 the European Commission set out a vision for an implementation and simplification agenda that delivers fast and visible improvements for people and business on the ground. That requires more than an incremental approach and the Union is to take bold action to achieve that goal. The European Parliament, the Council, the Commission, the Member States’ authorities at all levels and stakeholders need to work together to streamline and simplify Union , national and regional rules and implement policies more effectively.  (3) In its Communication on a Strategy for the Single Market 15 , the Commission identified as a barrier to the internal market that b usinesses face inconsistent national regulations which make it harder to sell, scale or move goods and services across borders. The Commission committed to focus on the ten most harmful barriers as a priority. The Communication identified c ertain features of extended producer responsibility schemes as one of the barriers most frequently reported by companies operating cross-border in the Union . While extended producer responsibility schemes are derived from Union legislation, a lack of uniformity of principles and requirements has led to a large diversity of extended producer responsibility schemes set up in Member States as well as to regulatory complexity and high administrative burden for companies. Th is Regulation is a first stepping stone to more profound simplification of the extended producer responsibility schemes in the area of waste, while the upcoming Circular Economy act should provide for further simplification.  (4) In particular, d ue to that lack of harmonisation, in particular regarding the current provisions in sectoral legislation for the appointment of an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility , the fulfilment of the obligations related to the appointment may result in an unnecessary administrative burden on producers operating in multiple Member States where they are not established. Particularly for small and m edium -sized enterprises , the obligation to appoint authorised representatives separately in every Member State where the producer places products on the market poses a significant challenge in terms of costs. With a view to ensuring equal conditions for producers established in the Union , it is important that producers are subject to the same rules in all Member States for appointing an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility. The currently fragmented legal framework for different products and the administrative burden associated with fulfilling the requirement to appoint an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility in up to 26 Member States is hampering the competitiveness of producers established in the Union . It is thus crucial to harmonise the existing rules effectively and promptly, reducing the associated burdens on such producers. To this effect, the Commission is currently reviewing the effectiveness, the administrative burden and the unintended barriers for the internal market , of the obligation to appoint authorised representatives as a safeguard for the producers’ compliance with the ‘polluter pays‘ principle. This review is likely to lead to alternative solutions which are more effective and less burdensome.  (5) With a view to simplifying requirements on producers , and reducing the administrative burden, battery producers and producers of packaging or packaged products (‘packaging producers’) should be able to choose whether they appoint an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility when making available products on the market of another Member State where they are not established , but the appointment should not be mandatory. This allows those producers who have already appointed an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility to retain their existing arrangements , while immediately alleviating the costs and administrative burden for producers who wish to not appoint an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility.  (6) Ensuring traceability and enforcement with regard to battery producers and packaging producers established in third countries is more challenging compared to those operating within the Union, as such producers fall outside the territorial scope of Member States’ enforcement powers and are not covered by the Union administrative and judicial cooperation mechanisms that enable the enforcement of obligations and judgments within the internal market. The existing provisions on the appointment of an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility for producers established in third countries should therefore be maintained in their current form. Thus, the provision in Regulation (EU) 2025/40 of the European Parliament and of the Council 16 which sets out that Member States may provide that producers established in third countries are to appoint an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility when making packaging or packaged products available on their territory for the first time should remain applicable. However, Member States should be allowed to ensure traceability and enforcement with regard to packaging producers established in third countries through alternative means. Similarly, the provision in Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 of the European Parliament and of the Council 17 which sets out that battery producers that are established in the Union or in third countries and that are making available batteries within the territory of a Member State by means of distance contracts are to appoint an authorised representative should remain applicable to the extent that it covers producers established in third countries. However, Member States should be required to ensure traceability and enforcement with regard to battery producers established in third countries through alternative means.  (7) The provision in Regulation (EU ) 2023/1542 that makes the appointment of an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility for producers established in the Union and selling batteries by means of distance contracts directly to end-users in another Member State mandatory should be suspended until 1 January 2035.  (8) The provision in Regulation (EU) 2025/40 that makes the appointment of an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility for producers established in the Union and making packaging or packaged products available for the first time on the territory of another Member State, directly to end users, mandatory should be suspended until 1 January 2035.  (9) The Commission is preparing a legislative proposal for a comprehensive reform of the extended producer responsibility system. The proposal is expected to be tabled by the Commission, in accordance with its Work Programme, in 2026. The legislative proposal will be subject to the ordinary legislative procedure and, if adopted by the European Parliament and by the Council, the Member States and the producers will have to take the necessary measures to align their regulatory and organisational measures with regard to the extended producer responsibility , as well as their conduct to the new rules.  (10) Suspending the application of the requirement for battery producers and packaging producers established in one of the Member States to appoint authori s ed representatives for extended prod ucer responsibility when making batteries or packaging or packaged products available in another Member State serves as a preliminary measure to immediately alleviate burdens for producers, paving the way for the implementation of a comprehensive reform of the extended producer responsibility system .  (11) Since the objectives of this Regulation , namely to provide flexibility to producers established in the Union as to whether they appoint an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives,  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Article 1  Suspension of Article 56(3) of Regulation (EU) 2023/1542  The application of Article 56(3) of Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 shall be suspended until 1 January 2035.  As regards battery producers established in third countries, where Member States do not require the appointment of an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility, they shall ensure traceability and enforcement with regard to battery producers established in third countries through alternative means.  Article 2  Suspension of Article 45(3) of Regulation (EU) 2025/40  The application of Article 45(3) of Regulation (EU) 2025/40 shall be suspended until 1 January 2035.  Member States may either provide that producers established in third countries shall appoint, by written mandate, an authorised representative for the extended producer responsibility when making packaging or packaged products available on their territory for the first time or ensure traceability and enforcement with regard to packaging producers established in third countries through alternative means.  Article 3  Entry into force  This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union .  This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.

FRAMEWORK OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE  1.1. Title of the proposal/initiative  Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council suspending the application of the rules on the appointment of an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility for batteries and waste batteries and packaging and packaging waste  1.2. Policy area(s) concerned  Environment  European Green Deal  1.3. Objective(s)  1.3.1. General objective(s)  The general objective pursued by this legislative proposal is to simplify elements of Regulations (EU) 2023/1542 and (EU) 2025/40 with regard to the appointment of an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility.  1.3.2. Specific objective(s)  By suspending the application of the provisions in Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 and (EU) 2025/40 that mandate the appointment of an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility for producers established in the Union, packaging and battery producers will be able to choose whether they appoint an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility when making available products on the market of another Member State where they are not established, but the appointment will not be mandatory. This allows those producers who have already appointed an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility to retain their existing arrangements, while immediately alleviating the costs and administrative burden for producers who wish to not appoint an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility. 1.3.3. Expected result(s) and impact  Specify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted. The proposed suspension of the application of the mandatory appointment of an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility for producers established in the Union will alleviate administrative burden and costs from the producers of packaging and batteries. Especially SMEs will benefit from not having to appoint an authorised representative.  1.3.4. Indicators of performance  Specify the indicators for monitoring progress and achievements.  To monitor progress towards achieving the proposal’s specific objectives, the Commission will explore the possibility of organising exchanges with Member States in different formats, including by using the existing fora.  1.4. The proposal/initiative relates to:   a new action   a new action following a pilot project / preparatory action 18   the extension of an existing action   a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action  1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative  1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative  The suspension should apply until 1 January 2035.  1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, greater effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this section 'added value of EU involvement' is the value resulting from EU action, that is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.  The proposal will create a harmonised approach across sectoral legislation. To ensure uniform conditions for producers within the Union, it is essential that the same provisions are applied across Member States for appointing an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility. The existing fragmented legal framework for various products and the administrative challenges linked with appointing an authorised representative in up to 26 Member States are hindering the competitiveness of Union-based producers. It is necessary to efficiently and swiftly harmonise the current rules, thereby alleviating the burdens faced by these producers.  1.5.3.

CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  This proposal aims to contribute to the timely and efficient development and interoperability of resilient energy infrastructure across the EU. Energy network infrastructure plays a crucial role in reinvigorating EU competitiveness, ensuring the security of our Union and in the energy transition and decarbonisation. At the same time, the development of energy networks is confronted with new and significant challenges,  Electricity grids will need to serve growing demand linked to electrification of end-uses and the ramp-up of the hydrogen system. Electrification of final energy consumption in the Union is aimed to increase from around 23% currently to around 32% in 2030 , as set out in the Clean Industrial Deal . 1 Member States should aim for an electricity interconnectivity level of 15% by 2030 . 2 Networks will need to integrate 2.2-2.4 TW of renewables capacity to meet 2040 EU targets . 3 Grids will need to adapt for the EU to have a more decentralised, digitalised and flexible electricity system with millions of rooftop solar panels and local energy communities sharing resources. By 2040, electricity transmission and distribution grids will require investments of EUR 1.2 trillion and hydrogen networks of EUR 240 billion . 4 Offshore renewables alone should increase by up to 360 GW by 2050 5 , which need to be connected to shore including through necessary onshore grid reinforcements. Hydrogen will be important in decarbonising industrial and transport processes where electrification is not an attainable solution . Hydrogen networks will connect production and demand centres across Europe, where on-site hydrogen production is not feasible.  The Draghi report 6 called for simplifying and streamlining permitting and administrative processes as well as for a coordinated strategic approach to cross-border infrastructure development between the EU and Member States. The Council invite d the Commission to propose a strengthened framework for grid planning and rollout to be compliant with EU targets . 7 In its Conclusions of 16 June 2025 8 , the Council call ed on the Commission to propose a grid s package consisting of measures to, inter alia , simplify EU rules on grids, integrate EU-level, regional and national needs, ensure the delivery of projects, develop effective cost sharing mechanisms for cross-border projects of common interest, and assess the need for further legislative proposals to accelerate permitting of energy infrastructure. The European Council in its Conclusions also called for Union-wide long-term investment planning to fully integrate and interconnect the EU electricity market, contributing to the Union’s energy security, and infrastructure protection and resilience . 9 The European Parliament highlighted the importance of modernising and expanding grids , as well as investment into digitalisation, with a focus on integrated cross-sector and cross-level planning . 10 It also emphasises cross-border infrastructure as a condition for successful deepening of the single market and for increasing the Union’s resilience. 11  The TEN-E Regulation, adopted in 2013, has contributed to the Union’s core energy policy objectives by laying down rules for identifying and ensuring the timely development of Projects of Common Interest (PCIs), that will ensure interoperability of trans-European energy networks, the functioning of the internal energy market, security of supply in the Union and the integration of renewable forms of energy. It has also contributed to streamlined permit granting procedures for Projects of Common Interest (PCIs) and provided for regulatory assistance, rules and guidance for the cross-border allocation of costs and risk-related incentives and the conditions to access financing from the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). The TEN-E Regulation was revised in 2022 to bring the framework in line with the 2050 climate neutrality objective under the European Green Deal.  While the objectives of the TEN-E Regulation remain largely valid, several short-comings need to be addressed to ensure the framework is fit to support a decarbonised, competitive and resilient energy system towards 2050, in line with the Clean Industrial Deal objectives and the European Climate Law.  First, e xisting and planned infrastructure projects are not sufficiently targeted towards achieving the EU’s energy and climate objectives . There is a substantial gap between our cross-border electricity infrastructure needs and the speed and level of infrastructure development at both the transmission and distribution grid level. 12 For electricity, about half of cross-border electricity needs for 2030 (41 of 88 GW) will remain unaddressed, and this gap is expected to increase the next decade. By 2040, cross-border electricity capacity needs will amount to 108 GW. 13 Failing to address infrastructure needs could hinder system decarbonisation, undermine security of supply and potentially lead to further market fragmentation and higher energy prices. From system efficiency perspective, current framework does not consider use of alternatives to grid expansion, such as non-wire or digital solutions. Further, improved hydrogen network planning and integration will be crucial to ensure system optimisation and decarbonisation of industry.  Second, the implementation of cross-border infrastructure projects is too slow , increasing overall project costs and impeding network development. The completion of electricity infrastructure projects takes up to 10 years for transmission grids. Delays are often attributed to difficulties in reaching agreement on cost-sharing when projects carry benefits outside their hosting Member States. As cross-border infrastructure becomes more integrated, the number of such projects with benefits occurring outs  ide the hosting Member States is expected to increase. In addition, delayed permitting procedures continue to constitute a key bottleneck, accounting for more than half of the time needed to complete an electricity transmission infrastructure project.  Finally, concerns over infrastructure security . Recent physical and cyber security incidents have highlighted the risk of hostile actors targeting the Union’s energy infrastructure, with economic cost implications and consequences for the stability of our energy system. There is also a rising interest from third-country actors to invest in EU energy infrastructure, which can increase the Union’s exposure to risks related to energy security. Beyond deliberate acts of sabotage, emerging risks including natural hazards and climate-related impacts also affect the resilience of the EU’s energy infrastructure.  This proposal to revise the TEN-E Regulation aims to address these issues, which were identified in the Impact Assessment and Implementation Report accompanying this proposal. Specifically, the proposal will introduce changes to:  · Ensur e that projects included in the network development plans and selected as PCIs/PMIs address appropriately and effectively identified infrastructure needs with due consideration of non-wire solutions .  · Facilitat e the use of cost-sharing tools for faster deployment of cross-border infrastructure projects, leading to an increased use of cost-sharing tools and a reduction in project deployment times.  · Simplify and accelerate permit gran ting procedures for cross-border energy infrastructure projects (PCIs/PMIs) making it feasible to meet existing deadlines.  · Enhanc e physical and cyber security and resilience of cross-border energy infrastructure.  Further, the initiative assessed and identified a set of measures to simplify and improve the efficiency of the TEN-E Regulation and reduce compliance and regulatory costs for stakeholders where possible (see below).  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  This proposal responds to the Commission’s commitment in the Action Plan for Affordable Energy 14 to propose a European Grid Package consisting of legislative and non-legislative measure s to, amongst others, simplify the TEN-E Regulation , ensure cross-border integrated planning and delivery of projects, especially on interconnectors ; streamline permitting for grid s , enhance electricity distribution grid planning; accelerate the ramp-up of the hydrogen market; boost digitalisation and innovation. The proposal builds on the revision of the TEN-E Regulation in 2022 , as well as the 2023 EU Action Plan for Grids 15 that focused on implementing the TEN-E Regulation framework.  The Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) is complementary to the TEN-E Regulation by addressing the financing gap for PCIs with a high socioeconomic and societal value , but which lack commercial viability. The eligibility for financial assistance under CEF is linked to the scope of the infrastructure categories covered under the revised TEN-E Regulation considering that hav ing obtained PCI or PMI status is a precondition for financing from CEF for cross-border infrastructure projects. The proposal is consistent with the current CEF under the 2021-2027 Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), as well as the proposal for the CEF under the 2028-20 34 MFF , which highlights “ the vital importance of a genuine Energy Union and well-integrated EU infrastructure networks ” by substantially increasing the budget proposed for the CEF-E 16 .  The proposal is also consistent with the targets and objectives set out in the Electricity Market Directive and Regulation, the Governance Regulation and the Renewable Energy Directive, notably enabling the integration of the Union’s energy markets and the large-scale deployment and integration of renewable energy sources and flexibility solutions.  • Consistency with other Union policies  This proposal is complementary to other initiatives that aim to create a more integrated European energy market. It is also consistent with the proposed 2040 EU climate target and 2050 climate neutrality obligation enshrined in the European Climate Law. This proposal is adopted together with an amending Directive aiming to accelerate the permitting of energy infrastructure projects, including transmission and distribution grids, storage and recharging station and renewable energy projects in order to facilitate their fast deployment.  The revision of the TEN-E Regulation aims to support the goals of the electricity market legislation by ensuring that infrastructure brings additional socio-economic welfare and to further strengthen efficient use of existing infrastructure. Possible measures to enhance electricity interconnection targets enshrined in the Governance Regulation will be assessed as part of the revision of that Regulation and measures to further support the necessary national investment levels in energy infrastructure.  The security-related measures under this proposal build on the requirements of the horizontal security legislation, including the EU Critical Entities Resilience Directive 17 , the NIS 2 Directive 18 and the Network Code on sector-specific rules for cybersecurity aspects of cross-border electricity flows 19 . Measures suggested under this proposal support its objectives and implementation , as well as the framework for the screening of foreign direct investments into the Union , while being specifically focused on infrastructure in scope of the TEN-E . T he 2026 revision of the EU Energy Security Framework will address energy security horizontally, complementing the network specific approach under this proposal .  The Industrial Accelerator Act will include measures to accelerate permitting of projects to decarbonise energy-intensive industries. Having sufficient grid capacity and timely grid connection is crucial to electrify industry, hence both initi atives are developed in close cooperation . 20 The proposal is also relevant for the Trans-Mediterranean Renewable Energy and Clean Tech (T-MED) Initiative and the Pact for the Mediterranean.  In view of the planned Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) Package, th is proposal will not address carbon dioxide cross-border infrastructure planning. Given a strong link between network planning on a national, regional and local levels and the heating and cooling sector, the recent revision of the Gas Directive 21 requires stronger coordination among sectors. The Grids Package aims to build upon these requirements . In addition, the upcoming Electrification Action Plan and the Strategic Roadmap on Digitalisation and AI in the energy sector as well as the Heating and Cooling Strategy will provide important input for future grid planning. The Package also underpin s the upcoming Cloud and AI Development Act to attract investment in data centres.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  The proposal is based on Article 172 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union ( TFEU), which provides for the legal basis to adopt guidelines covering the objectives, priorities and broad lines of measures envisaged in the sphere of trans-European networks as set out in Article 171. The guidelines are to identify PCIs that are necessary for making the TEN-E fit for purpose and set the conditions under which the EU may financially support the PCIs.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  The proposed amendments fulfil the principle of subsidiarity , as action at Union level will contribute to the further integration of the Union energy market through the modernisation and development of Europe’s cross-border energy network more effectively than action at national level.  The need for EU action  Energy transmission infrastructure (including an interconnected offshore grid and smart grid infrastructure) has a European added value due to its cross-border impacts and is essential to achieve a climate neutral energy system. The TEN-E Regulation has contributed to achieving results regarding the Union energy market integration, competition and security of supply. A framework for regional cooperation across Member States is necessary to develop cross-border energy infrastructure. The internal energy market requires cross-border infrastructure, the development of which requires cooperation of two or more Member States, all with their own regulatory framework.  National regulation and planning are not sufficient as individual national administrations do not have the power to deal with cross-border infrastructure planning. Internal network elements significantly influence the possibilities of cross-border infrastructure development, which in turn affects cross-border trade. More closely coordinating national and European planning is necessary due to the character of the EU’s meshed network and to build a more efficient energy system.  EU added value  The TEN-E Regulation has provided added value compared to what could have been achieved at national or regional level alone. More than 100 projects were completed thanks to the PCI status between 2013-2025. The accelerated electrification, decarbonisation and digitalisation of industry and deployment of renewable energy projects call for the reinforcement of energy infrastructure at an unprecedented pace, that cannot be met by national measures alone. More effective cross-border planning will improve the integration of clean energy sources as well as meeting electricity market needs, which would help the EU reach its energy and climate targets. A more integrated market encourages the development and uptake of innovative technologies for transmission and distribution of energy and contributes to system flexibility and security of supply. This can result in a more efficient network and improve cross-border trade for a more cost-efficient and secure energy system.  • Proportionality  The initiative complies with the proportionality principle. It falls within the scope for action in the field of the trans-European energy networks, as defined in Article 170 of the TFEU. The policy intervention is proportional to the scale and nature of the problems identified in the Impact Assessment and the achievement of the set objectives of the initiative. The proposed revision of the TEN-E Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the general objective of ensuring the timely and efficient development and interoperability of resilient energy infrastructure, renewable energy and flexibility, including storage and recharging stations, across the EU.  The proposed measures contribute to more effectively addressing the Union’s energy infrastructure needs, ensure faster project deployment, and enhance the resilience of the EU’s energy network infrastructure, without imposing significant costs for Transmission System Operators and project promoters, Member States, National Regulatory Authorities and the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER).  Based on the results of the Implementation Report, the Commission assessed several policy options covering four impact areas of the current TEN-E framework, namely infrastructure planning and project implementation, cost and benefit sharing, permitting and security. The comparison of the options (see section 6 and 7 of the Impact Assessment Report) indicates that Policy Option 2 is best suited to achieve the specific objective of the initiative without imposing disproportionate additional burden on relevant actors. The proposal is based on Policy Option 2 which appears proportional to the nature of the problem by focussing on streamlining the current processes and offering new substantive new tools that are considered effective to meet the objectives of this initiative.  • Choice of the instrument  Building on the overall positive experience with the implementation of the current TEN-E Regulation and the positive evaluation of the previous Regulation, the instrument chosen is a Regulation, an effective instrument which has direct application and is binding in its entirety, ensuring uniform implementation and legal certainty.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  Given the scope of th e proposed revision and the recent amendment of TEN-E Regulation in 2022, it was not feasible to conduct an ex-post evaluation. Instead, an Implementation Report was prepared and included as part of the Impact Assessment Report . The Implementation Report focuses on the performance of the specific provisions introduced and revised as part of the 2022 TEN-E Regulation revision. It replaces a full evaluation which would only be expected as part of the review of the TEN-E Regulation due in 2027 . 22 An evaluation was previously conducted between January 2019 and September 2020, in context of the 2022 TEN-E Regulation revision. 23  The Implementation Report provided evidence of the need for further improvements, namely when it comes to scenario development, infrastructure needs identification and consequent Ten Year Network Development Plan (TYNDP), PCI/PMI project selection and assessment, as well as cross-border cost allocation (CBCA) and permitting frameworks. The report found that the scenario development and infrastructure gaps identification processes are faced with drawbacks, including delays which hamper their effectiveness in meeting the TEN-E Regulation goals. The Commission and ACER have little means to steer the process towards identification of the key projects for the Union. Moreover, while the permitting-related amendments of the 2022 revision of TEN-E Regulation generally achieved their intended objective to increase the clarity and flexibility of procedures, further improvements could be made to support the acceleration of procedures, contributing to the process’s overall efficiency. Regarding cross-border cost allocation, the TEN-E Regulation provisions have facilitated the allocation of investment costs for PCI/PMIs, primarily to support CEF applications. However, there have been very few instances of involvement of non-hosting countries in CBCA decisions, and none in the electricity sector. Provisions have therefore had limited effectiveness in triggering additional investments from non-hosting countries that may otherwise significantly benefit from the projects.  This proposal aims to tackle these issues identified in the Implementation Report annexed to the Impact Assessment Report, through targeted amendments to the TEN-E Regulation.  • Stakeholder consultations  In line with the Better Regulation guidelines, the Commission carried out a comprehensive online public consultation between 13 May to 5 August 2025 on the ‘Have Your Say’ website. The consultation covered the following topics: i) the general functioning of the TEN-E Regulation, ii) EU infrastructure planning, iii) electricity network planning at national level, iv) electricity grid hosting capacity, v) permitting, vi) investments in grid infrastructure, vii) supply chains, viii) digitalisation and resilience, and ix) simplification.  The consultation received a total of 197 responses. In addition, 2 emails were received via a functional mailbox for the consultation. There were 197 responses to every multiple-choice question in the public consultation, meaning that every respondent answered each question. For some questions, respondents were asked on a five-point scale the extent to which they agreed or disagreed with statements. The scale was i) Strongly disagree ii) Slightly disagree, iii) Neutral, iv) Slightly agree, v) Strongly agree. A “don’t know” option was also given.  Stakeholders’ views were split on whether the TYNDP and national transmission development plans ensure integrated and coherent planning across EU and national levels. Opinions on the extent to which the TYNDP identifies all cross-border infrastructure needs were also diverse. Still, a majority (54%) indicated that the current governance framework of the TYNDPs, including stakeholder roles, should be revised to enhance its effectiveness. Moreover, in line with the legislative proposal, about half (44%) believed the TYNDP falls short in addressing identified infrastructure gaps and a majority (60%) agreed that national projects should more clearly support EU-wide priorities. Further, a majority of respondents (61%) also agreed that there is a need for stronger alignment between national transmission development plans. In addition, a majority of respondents (59%) were positive to streamlining the PCI/PMI application process by amending requirements for projects with PCI/PMI status to reapply during each process (provided certain conditions are met) in line with this proposal.  When asked whether the TYNDP should have a more top-down approach to infrastructure planning aimed at aligning network development with EU and Member State climate and energy goals, 41% of respondents (many of which system operators) disagreed whereas 36% agreed. Similarly, 41% of respondents (many of which system operators) expressed disagreement with the TYNDP having a more top-down European approach to better link identified needs and priority projects of common European interest, whereas 36% agreed. While this legislative proposal strengthens EU-level steer in the infrastructure planning process with the Commission taking over central scenario development and being empowered to launch calls for proposal to address infrastructure gaps, the proposal maintains strong Member State involvement and validation of steps in the process striking a balance to also align with the public consultation results. On the frequency of the processes, most stakeholders (85%) found the current two-year cycle appropriate. The legislative proposal prolongs the current two-year TYNDP cycle to four years, but maintains flexibility if updates are needed.  A majority of respondents were positive to the inclusion of internal reinforcements (72%) and non-wire solutions (54%) in infrastructure needs identification, aligning well with the legislative proposal. A majority (62%) of stakeholders also agreed that more EU-level action is needed to enhance the visibility and quantified benefits of digital, innovative, and grid-enhancing technologies. A larger majority, 76% argued that further measures are needed to increase the efficiency of the existing grid.  A s regards the cost-sharing , 38% 24 of respondents stated that the current framework is not fit for purpose and 36% 25 favoured that the CBCA framework further develops to facilitate the sharing of investment costs among countries, beyond hosting Member States, in proportion to the expected benefits , indicating support for legislative revision . Further, 37% 26 of respondents thought that an investment request within the CBCA framework could also cover several projects (‘bundling’ ) to facilitate cost sharing amongst more Member State beneficiaries in line with th is proposal .  Permitting was ranked by most respondents as a key barrier to developing grid infrastructure at the necessary pace for the energy transition, indicating support for the strengthening of the TEN-E framework in this respect. Further, about a third of respondents reported that the permitting provisions of the TEN-E Regulation are not clear or easy to implement, with 16% remaining neutral and 34% unsure. A vast majority of stakeholders support simplifying and streamlining of environmental assessments, digitalising permit-granting procedures, shortening of legal deadlines for permitting of networks in line with the legislative proposal.  As regards security-related measures, over a third of stakeholders agreed that the EU legal framework does not sufficiently address emerging security risks ( 38%) 27 and that additional security criteria for PCIs and PMIs are needed to enhance protection against physical and cyber risks (36%) 28 in line with the legislative proposal. Furthermore, only 14% indicated that the framework addresses the exclusion of non-trusted actors from participating in critical infrastructure projects, with 19% revealing neutrality and almost a majority, 45% (companies 41%, business associations 48%, NGOs 86%, public authorities 40%) being uncertain.  The feedback received from stakeholders as part of the consultation was taken into account in developing the proposal. The measures under this legislative proposal therefore align well with the stakeholder views.  For a detailed analysis of the public consultation results, please see Annex 2 of the Impact Assessment Report accompanying this initiative.  • Collection and use of expertise  The proposal and its underpinning impact assessment draws on evidence from the Implementation Report on the TEN-E Regulation, from stakeholder input to the extensive consultations carried out in this respect, as well as a literature review, PCI portfolio analysis and modelling.  Formal conclusions adopted in the framework of the Copenhagen Forum in 2023, 2024 and 2025 were also considered in the analysis. The Copenhagen Forum gathers annually representatives of the EU institutions, transmission system operators, project promoters, regulators, energy companies, NGOs and civil society and the financing community to discuss the challenges of developing Europe’s energy infrastructure.  ACER’s annual consolidated monitoring reports on the progress of electricity and gas PCIs, incremental capacity projects and virtual interconnection points, on the electricity and gas market monitoring and capacity allocation and congestion management, as well as other updates on the cross-border cost allocation decisions, project-specific risk-based incentives were equally considered.  The proposal and its underpinning impact assessment draws on evidence from the Implementation Report on the TEN-E Regulation, from stakeholder input and extensive consultations carried out in this respect, as well as a literature review, PCI portfolio analysis and modelling. Further information was gathered through several support studies to support the development of policy options and assessment on investment needs in infrastructure, infrastructure planning and costs of delays.  • Impact assessment  In accordance with the Better Regulation guidelines, the Commission carried out an impact assessment of several policy options. This work was supported by structured consultation within the Commission via an Inter-Service Steering Group. The impact assessment was presented to and discussed with the Regulatory Scrutiny Board (RSB). The RSB gave a positive opinion with reservations on 26 September 2025 which were notably addressed by: i) further clarifying the problem drivers and root causes and their links to the proposed measures, ii) elaborating the assessment of subsidiarity considerations, iii) revising the general and specific objectives, specifying what success will look like, making the operational objectives more S.M.A.R.T, and elaborating on monitoring arrangements, iv) more clearly presenting and justifying how the different options compare in terms of costs and benefits, v) further describing the content of permitting measures and their impacts, vi) highlighting possible trade-offs with other EU objectives (see Annex 1 of the Impact Assessment Report).  The impact assessment identified three key problems and their corresponding problem drivers. Throughout the impact assessment work, a range of measures were considered across four intervention areas – i) infrastructure planning and project implementation, ii) cost and benefit sharing, iii) permitting, and iv) security – to address the identified problems and achieve the general and specific objectives of the initiative. The measures under each intervention area were grouped into three policy options, following a logic of varying degrees of EU-level intervention and coordination, and taking into account internal compatibility and coherence of the measures (see Section 5.2.2 of the Impact Assessment Report).  Policy option 1 entails an enhanced bottom-up approach , introducing only a limited number of changes to the current EU legislative and policy framework in comparison to the business as usual and involves minimal additional EU-level intervention. As regards infrastructure planning and project implementation , it strengthens the existing framework by better defining certain requirements and simplifying processes (including PCI/PMI selection and Commission and ACER approvals) to ensure a leaner and more robust planning process. It also aligns the scope of PCI/PMI project categories, including by strengthening requirements related to electrolysers and removing the smart gas grid category. As regards cost and benefit sharing , it enhances transparency and strengthens EU principles as well as better enables the use of congestion income for financing cross-border electricity infrastructure as an incentive to cost-sharing. On permitting, it supports implementation of existing legislation, including by issuing guidance on the implementation of certain aspects of the environmental assessment framework. On security , it introduces physical and cyber-risk resilience considerations in the monitoring of PCIs and PMIs.  Policy option 2 entails moving from a bottom-up approach towards a more top-down approach with stronger steer from the EU-level and enhanced coordination with the current actors at Member State level. It introduces more significant changes to the current EU legislative and policy framework as compared to policy option 1, with additional EU-level coordination and reallocation of certain responsibilities among relevant stakeholders. As regards infrastructure planning and project implementation , it notably enhances the role of the Commission by entrusting it with central scenario development for the infrastructure needs identification as well as introduces a gap filling mechanism to ensure all infrastructure needs are addressed by project proposals. It also broadens the scope of the electricity PCI category to more prominently include non-wire solutions and better acknowledge the role of internal lines. As regards cost-benefit sharing , it introduces an enabling framework for the voluntary bundling of cross-border projects to enable and encourage discussions amongst relevant Member States and third countries. On permitting , it entails targeted legislative changes to accelerate permitting processes for cross-border infrastructure covered under the TEN-E Regulation. On security, it introduces additional transparency requirements regarding the ultimate beneficial owners of candidate PCIs/PMIs and including security and resilience-related equipment for the upgrade of existing electricity cross-border infrastructure under TEN-E scope.  Policy option 3 entails a full top-down approach for cross-border infrastructure. It includes substantial structural and institutional changes to the status quo and a higher degree of centralising and streamlining at EU level, including through entrusting infrastructure planning and coordination of permitting for cross-border infrastructure projects to EU bodies. As regards cost-benefit sharing, it builds on the measures of policy option 2 but introduces also mandatory regional planning and cost-sharing for offshore cross-border infrastructure projects. On security , policy option 2 and 3 are identical.  The policy options were compared along their effectiveness, efficiency, coherence, and proportionality . Policy option 2 and 3 are considered more effective, efficient and coherent with the overall EU policy framework than policy option 1. Policy option 1 only performs slightly better in terms of subsidiarity and proportionality. Therefore, policy option 1 is not considered as possible preferred policy option. While policy options 2 and 3 both perform better than policy option 1 as concerns their effectiveness in meeting the specific objectives, policy option 2 seems overall more effective at this stage when it comes to ensuring that projects included in network plans and selected as PCI/PMIs address appropriately identified infrastructure needs as well as to shorten and simplify permitting procedures. As regards the efficiency, policy option 3 is considered less efficient due to the additional resources needed and high-up front costs to set up two new entities at EU level (or reinforce existing ones) responsible for infrastructure planning and coordinated permitting procedures. In terms of subsidiarity and proportionality, measures proposed in policy option 3 (i.e. EU entities responsible for infrastructure planning and permitting as well as mandatory offshore grid planning) with a high degree of EU level intervention appear disproportionate at this stage considering they do not result in a higher level of effectiveness and are expected to entail substantially higher additional costs.  Following comparison of the policy options, policy option 2 was identified as the preferred option, best suited to achieve the general and specific objectives of the initiative in a proportionate manner. Policy option 2 is expected to have positive economic, social and environmental impacts . The key target groups expected to be impacted by this initiative are European citizens and consumers, project promoters (including TSOs), European TSO associations (ENTSO for Electricity, ENTSO for Gas, and ENNOH), National Competent Authorities and their local and regional representatives, National Regulatory Authorities, European Union Regulators, Distribution system operators and DSO branch organisations, and energy producers/industry.  As regards economic impacts, it is expected to significantly reduce energy system costs in line with the optimal grid scenario by ensuring that identified projects better match and fully cover the identified needs. For 2040, investments of EUR 6 bn/year into the optimal grid would lead to EUR 14 bn/year reduction in system costs, that is EUR 8 bn/year net saving. It is also expected to have a substantial impact on wholesale electricity prices by improving interconnectivity, leading to price convergence and, overall, more stable and lower prices, across the EU. An improved cost-sharing framework should facilitate the materialisation and quicker implementation of cross-border projects, with significant socio-economic welfare gains. Further, quicker permitting times and thereby project implementation, is expected to generate economic benefits in terms of avoided costs of delays for project promoters. Finally, through improved energy infrastructure security, the preferred option could bring about benefits in terms of avoided loss of economic welfare and of costs of repairs.  Energy system cost reductions are expected to have positive implications for competitiveness, through avoided costs and mitigating network tariff increases for consumers, including industry. The preferred option also shows positive impacts on digitalisation, through stronger emphasis on the use of non-wire solutions in grid planning and digitalisation of permitting procedures. The preferred option overall expected to reduce administrative and adjustment costs for businesses (including energy generators, project promoters, TSOs and ENTSOs) through streamlining infrastructure planning, PCI/PMI application and evaluation processes as well as permitting procedures.While the annual costs savings for businesses cannot be fully estimated as relevant data were not available, it can be concluded that the preferred option would lead to recurrent cost saving. For Member States and national authorities, policy option 2 would create additional administrative costs in the short-term, related to the implementation of revised legislative framework.  The initiative is expected to have positive social impacts, though the quantitative impacts and distributional effects are difficult to estimate. An optimised grid planning based on precise estimates of future development of demand and supply should avoid future stranded assets, minimising grid costs for consumers, and enable further electrification allowing to spread grid investment costs over a higher number of kWh.  As regards environmental benefits , the preferred policy option is expected to lead to a reduction of CO2 emissions (around 27 Mtonnes/year ) by aligning with the optimal grid scenario and decreasing renewable e n ergy curtailment . The additional 108 GW cross-border capacities needed by 2040 in line with the 2024 TYNDP would also allow to substitute 65 TWh of electricity produced by gas with RES generation, by allowing a better integration of non-CO 2 emitting generation, leading to a significant reduction of European CO 2 emissions estimated at 27 million ton nes of CO 2 emissions avoided in 2040. 29 As regards permitting, environmental impacts are highly dependent on the technology used and the assets’ location and the environmental status of the surrounding fauna and flora. The potential impacts are however addressed in the design of the proposed measures through introducing safeguard s.  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  The revised TEN-E Regulation is expected to bring positive impacts in terms of simplification and improved efficiency. The initiative is expected to reduce the administrative burden on ENTSOs, TSOs and project promoters notably as regards infrastructure planning as a result of the Commission taking over central scenario development and through simplifications such as the reduced frequency to a four-year cycle and the amended application and evaluation process for mature PCIs. The streamlined, simplified and digitalised permitting procedures for PCIs and PMIs would also reduce the administrative burden for businesses. The annual cost savings for businesses cannot be fully estimated as relevant data were not available, but it can be concluded that the proposal will lead to recurrent cost savings.  No direct impacts in terms of compliance or administrative costs for SMEs or micro-enterprises are identified. SMEs could benefit from positive competitiveness impacts as a result of lower energy system costs, as well as increased competitiveness in those technology areas that are included or strengthened in the proposal (e.g. high-voltage technologies).  The initiative is consistent with the Digital Check and is internet ready and appropriate for both the physical and digital environment. The proposal includes measures to promote digitalisation (see the Legislative Financial and Digital Statement).  • Fundamental rights  The initiative is not expected to have an impact on fundamental rights.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  The budgetary impact associated to the proposal concerns the resources of the European Commission Directorate-General for Energy and the Joint Research Centre, as well as the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER). The Commission will take on substantial additional responsibilities for central scenario development as part of the infrastructure needs identification process in the Ten-Year Network Development Plan. These responsibilities will require additional resources (see Legislative Financial and Digital Statement).  The ACER will be tasked with additional responsibilities in the oversight of the Ten-Year Network Development Plan, as well as the cross-border cost allocation framework. These additional responsibilities will also require additional resources (see Legislative Financial and Digital Statement).  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  Building on the existing processes for monitoring data from regular reports prepared by project promoters and national regulators, several indicators have been developed to measure the achievement of each of the specific objective of the revised TEN-E Regulation. The actual impacts of the legislation will be monitored and evaluated against a set of indicators tailored to the specific policy objectives to be achieved with the legislation.  All data will be monitored on the basis of regular reports from project promoters and national regulators, and on the basis of the existing monitoring requirements of ACER including the biennial monitoring of consistency between the Union-wide TYNDP and national network development plans, annual monitoring of progress of PCIs and PMIs and permitting processes, annual monitoring report on congestion management and capacity allocation, monitoring of the application of non-wire and grid enhancing technologies based on data available by the Joint Allocation Office, and annual monitoring of the achievement of the interconnection target, done as part of the European Semester.  By 30 June 2033, the Commission shall carry out a review of this Regulation, on the basis of the results of the reporting and evaluation provided for in Article 24 of this Regulation, as well as the monitoring, reporting and evaluation carried out pursuant to Articles 22 and 23 of Regulation (EU) 2021/1153.  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  Chapter I of the Regulation outlines the general provisions, notably its subject matter, objectives and scope as well as the definitions applicable. It introduces, complemented by Annex II, new infrastructure categories compared to Regulation (EU) 2022/869 to ensure strengthened safety, security and efficiency of existing networks, notably to enable existing high-voltage networks elements to operate systems safely through investments in monitoring control and digitalisation equipment and installations and to increase the protection and resilience of critical network elements through investment in equipment that is specifically designed for that purpose and physically connected to those elements. Project categories and definitions are also adjusted to align with the EU’s decarbonised gas and hydrogen legislative package adopted in 2024 setting common rules for the transition to renewable and low-carbon gases; this package prioritises the production and use of hydrogen in its pure form and its transportation in the dedicated hydrogen system. A definition of “non-wire” solutions in electricity is also introduced; these solutions need to be carefully considered as they may be cheaper than grid expansion to ensure cost-optimal grid planning.  Chapter II outlines the provisions as regards the process of preparing the Union lists of projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest within the regional groups, the criteria for the assessment of projects by the groups and the monitoring of project implementation.  Article 3, complemented by Annex III, provides rules for the establishment of regional groups as well as for the process for establishing the Union list of projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest. Compared with Regulation (EU) 2022/869, Article 3 and Annex III provide for a simplified approach for advanced projects already on the Union list to maintain their status of project of common interest or project of mutual interest.  Compared with Regulation (EU) 2022/869, Article 4 which sets out the criteria for the assessment of projects by the groups, complemented by Annex IV, further clarifies that projects of mutual interest extend to the first connection point in the third country and ensures that these projects are accompanied by corresponding development in internal infrastructure in third countries. For Energy Community contracting countries, the benefits brought by individual projects are considered for both EU and Energy Community contracting countries, and not only for the EU as done so far.  In Article 5 the provisions on the implementation and monitoring of projects on the Union list are strengthened by requirements related to risk assessments as regards physical and cyber security, building on Directive (EU) 2022/2557 on the resilience of critical entities and Directive (EU) 2022/2555 on measures for a high common level of cybersecurity across the Union. As regards European coordinators that may be designated where a project encounters significant implementation difficulties, Article 6 provides that the period for which the designation applies may be renewed.  Chapter III addresses the permit granting and public acceptance of projects of common interest. Compared with Regulation (EU) 2022/869  this chapter has been revised with three main objectives: (1) update the permitting framework to ensure that projects of common interest  and projects of mutual interest are granted the best treatment possible in line with their strategic importance and special status, especially when considering the permitting measures introduced in the Hydrogen and Decarbonised Gas Market Package and the revised Renewable Energy Directive; (2) update the permitting regime to support the accelerated permitting for electricity grids, in line with the needs recognised in the Draghi report and the amendments introduced in Directive (EU) 2019/944; (3) increase the clarity of the permitting regime and improve its efficiency.  Article 7 on the priority status of projects on the Union list is updated to include requirements that electricity projects of common and mutual interest benefit from an automatic presumption of overriding public interest and, when included in a National Development Plan subjected to a strategical environmental assessment and to an appropriate assessment under Directive 92/43/EEC in case there is a likely significant impact on Natura 2000 sites, may, subject to strict conditions, be exempted from assessments under specified environmental legislation.  Article 8 on the organisation of the permit granting process clarifies the responsibilities of national competent authorities established under the Regulation in line with the different permitting schemes, especially in what concerns cooperation with other authorities and mediation of contacts with project promoters. It also increases the cross-border cooperation requirements for projects involving multiple jurisdictions.  Article 9 on transparency and public participation provides for increased clarity and simplicity of the procedure, notably by merging the reporting obligations of this article into a single report.  Article 10 on duration and implementation of the permit granting process introduces in particular an obligation to digitalise permitting procedures; clarifies what is considered as the starting date for the permitting procedure; makes the optional nature of the pre-application phase clearer; elaborates on the steps comprising it (scoping, screening, scheduling, application file verification); clarifies the need to take into account existing studies and authorisations to reduce duplication when defining the documentation necessary for the permitting process; and introduces tacit approval to decisions taken by the concerned national authorities with the exception of environmental decisions.  Chapter IV outlines the provisions as regards cross-sectoral infrastructure planning, which are strengthened compared with Regulation (EU) 2022/689, with a view to better steering of the planning, notably as regards the definition of future scenarios, the identification of long-term energy infrastructure needs and bottlenecks and addressing those needs with the most adequate solutions.  Article 11 empowers the Commission to adopt delegated acts establishing a central scenario for the electricity, hydrogen and gas sectors to be used for the Union-wide TYNDP, the infrastructure needs identification process, the energy system wide cost-benefit analysis and the cross-border cost allocation of energy infrastructure projects. To ensure data used for developing the scenario are up-to date, the Commission has a right to request them from Member States, the ENTSO for Electricity, the ENTSO for Gas and the ENNOH, as relevant. The scenario should be developed in a cross-sectoral manner. TYNDP scenarios have until now been developed by the ENTSO for Electricity, the ENTSO for Gas and the ENNOH.  Article 12 entrusts the ENTSO for Electricity and the ENNOH, with developing an infrastructure needs identification report for electricity and hydrogen respectively. The report should identify infrastructure gaps affecting the Union’s objectives related to electricity and hydrogen, based in particular on a binding methodology to be prepared by ACER and the central scenario pursuant to Article 11. The Article provides that the infrastructure needs identification reports must be endorsed by the decision-making body of the TEN-E Group, which is the cross-regional meeting configuration of all Groups established under the Regulation. Specifically for electricity, the report must consider non-wire solutions when assessing and addressing the needs.  Article 13 empowers the Commission to launch a needs matching process in the electricity system to identify possible solutions for unmatched needs in case the infrastructure needs identification report for electricity concludes that projects submitted for inclusion in the Union wide ten-year network development plan do not fully meet the infrastructure needs identified pursuant to Article 12. The needs matching process should be based on existing regional cooperation, steered by the Commission and linked with the TYNDP process.  Article 14 mandates the ENTSO for Electricity and the ENNOH to use consistent single sector methodologies for a harmonised energy system-wide cost-benefit analysis at Union level when assessing projects (in all energy infrastructure categories except smart electricity grids and CO 2 ) for their inclusion in their respective Union wide ten-year network development plans. The methodologies must be submitted to the Commission for approval. ENTSO for Electricity and the ENNOH are required to calculate and publish, as part of the Union-wide ten-year network development plan, the results of cost-benefit analyses for all projects, showing how the benefits are distributed across countries. The Article further specifies that for smart electricity grids projects and CO 2 projects, it is for the Commission to develop methodologies for a harmonised energy system-wide cost-benefit analysis at Union level, as is the case today.  The provisions under Chapter V address the need to develop the grid to accommodate the significant expected scale-up of electricity generation from offshore renewable energy sources. The Chapter supports the coordinated long-term planning and development of offshore and onshore infrastructure. As a novelty, under Article 15  Member States are required, as part of their non-binding agreements and within their specific priority offshore grid corridors, to consider establishing specific cross-border goals, such as for hybrid or cross-border radial projects, with the aim to achieve the goals for offshore renewable generation to be deployed within each sea basin in the most efficient manner.  Chapter VI strengthens the provisions for a regulatory framework enabling investments with a cross-border impact.  Firstly, it specifies in Article 17 the principles that national regulatory authorities must apply when allocating costs across borders, including that in order to ensure investment certainty, the cross-border cost allocation (‘CBCA’) must be based on an ex-ante cost-allocation agreement, with the possibility of ex-post adjustments, provided that such adjustments are explicitly defined in the cost allocation decision and clearly framed, including as regards timeframes and categories of costs covered. Where appropriate, the allocation of costs amongst Member States shall be based on the distribution of net-benefits. It also includes that if 10% or more of a project’s estimated benefits occur in a Member State, that Member State and its national regulatory authority shall take part in the cross-border cost allocation process. ACER is mandated to update its Recommendation on identifying good practices for the treatment of investment requests for projects in line with the above-mentioned principles and to establish a central repository of all cross-border cost-allocation decisions taken by national regulatory authorities and to host it on its website as well as to provide a non-binding CBCA template to facilitate the work of national regulatory agencies.  Secondly, a new Article (Article 18) is introduced, which supports a process under which  project promoters may bundle two or more projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest  to facilitate the discussions on cost-sharing between the relevant Member States, and with third countries as appropriate, and the CBCA decisions between the concerned competent authorities of the Member States or between the competent authorities of the Member States and third countries, as appropriate. Article 18 further clarifies the rules on joint cost-benefit analysis and CBCA applicable to such bundles of projects in view of facilitating a possible CEF application.  Thirdly, new Article (Article 19) is introduced, requiring transmission system operators (‘TSOs’) to set aside, for network investments into projects on the Union list relevant to reducing interconnector congestion, 25% of the congestion rents not spent for guaranteeing the actual availability of allocated capacity and for compensation to offshore renewable electricity generation plant operators.  Article 19 specifies conditions for the use of the funds and empowers the Commission to adopt delegated acts to further specify the conditions under which TSOs may use these funds and the conditions for their release. ACER is required to update its existing methodology on the use of revenues from congestion income pursuant Article 19(4) Electricity Regulation to ensure consistency with these new provisions.  Lastly, Article 20 lays down the conditions under which Member States and national regulatory authorities may grant appropriate incentives for projects that incur higher risks for the development, construction, operation or maintenance, when compared to the risks normally incurred by a comparable infrastructure project.  Chapter VII sets out the conditions for the eligibility of projects on the Union list for financial assistance under the Connecting Europe Facility, including for the new infrastructure categories. In particular, compared with Regulation (EU) 2022/689, Article 21 sets out in more detail the criteria applicable for projects other than the energy infrastructure that are under the competence of national regulatory authorities. Since those projects do not receive a CBCA, they must receive an evaluation carried out by the relevant national authority and the provision develops the conditions for such an evaluation. Article 22 provides that the specific criteria set out in Article 4(3) and the parameters set out in Article 4(5) of the Regulation must be applied for the purpose of establishing award criteria for Union financial assistance under the Regulation on the Connecting Europe Facility and lays down additional requirements for legacy gas projects concerning Cyprus and Malta under Article 27 of the Regulation.  Chapter VIII includes final provisions regarding delegated acts, reporting and evaluation, including regarding the digitalisation of the permitting process, the improvement of physical and cyber security resilience of cross-border energy infrastructure and the uptake of non-wire solutions, the review of the Regulation as well as information and publicity of the projects. It further maintains the existing derogations for the gas interconnectors of Malta and Cyprus until Cyprus or Malta, respectively, is directly interconnected to the trans-European gas network or until 31 December 2029, whichever is the earlier. The Chapter further lists amendments to other energy acquis resulting from the amendments introduced in the Regulation and sets out transitional provisions and provisions for the repeal of the current TEN-E Regulation. In particular, the revised Regulation does not affect the granting, continuation or modification of financial assistance awarded previously under the Connecting Europe Facility, and the existing Union list of projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest  is to remain in force and produce effects until a new Union list of projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest pursuant to this Regulation is established and enters into force.  2025/0399 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  on guidelines for trans-European energy infrastructure, amending Regulations (EU) 2019/942, (EU) 2019/943 and (EU) 2024/1789 and repealing Regulation (EU) 2022/869  (Text with EEA relevance)  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 172 thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 30 ,  Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions 31 ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) The Commission Communication of 26 February 2025 on the “Clean Industrial Deal” 32 sets out a joint roadmap for competitiveness and decarbonisation. Securing affordable energy is a key condition for the competitiveness of the Union industry, especially for energy-intensive sectors. Access to affordable energy is therefore a cornerstone of the Clean Industrial Deal as well as the Action Plan for Affordable Energy 33 . At the same time, decarbonisation policies are a powerful driver of growth when they are well integrated with industrial, competition, economic and trade policies as set out in the Commission Communication of 29 January 2025 on a “Competitiveness Compass for the EU” 34 . With Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 of the European Parliament and of the Council 35 , the Union has set out an ambitious framework to become a decarbonised economy by 2050.  (2) As part of the ambition of Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 , the binding Union level target for renewable energy for 2030 has been increased to 42.5 % renewable energy in the U nion ’s energy mix by 2030, aiming for 45 % 36 ,  and the binding Union level target for energy efficiency has been made more ambitious, with a reduction of Union final energy consumption by 11.7 % by 2030, compared to 2020 projections 37 . With the intermediate target of at least 55 % net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction compared with 1990 levels by 2030 well on track, on 2 July 2025 the Commission proposed an amendment to Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 38 setting a Union climate target for 2040 of a 90 % reduction in net GHG emissions, compared to 1990 levels.  (3) Infrastructure needs to be in place to support the Union energy transition in accordance with those targets, including rapid electrification, scaling up renewable and fossil fuel free electricity generation, the increased use of renewable and low-carbon gases, energy integration and a higher uptake of innovative solutions. Current investments in cross-border energy infrastructure are clearly insufficient to transform and build the energy infrastructure needed to support those targets and there is a substantial gap between our cross-border electricity infrastructure needs and the speed and level of infrastructure development at both the transmission and distribution grid level . 39 For electricity, about half of cross-border electricity needs for 2030 (41 of 88 GW) will remain unaddressed, and this gap is expected to increase the next decade. By 2040, cross-border electricity capacity needs will amount to 108 GW. 40 . Increased investments in energy infrastructure are therefore necessary, and the Draghi report 41 pointed in particular to the need to rapidly increase the deployment of cross-border energy infrastructure to decarbonise Europe’s industry. In the Clean Industrial Deal 42 and the accompanying “ Action Plan for Affordable Energy ” 43 , the Commission underlined the crucial role of completing the Energy Union by investing in energy infrastructure and cross-border grids for safeguarding the competitiveness of Union industry and the prosperity of people as well as for the affordability and security of energy supply.  (4) Regulation (EU) 2022/869 of the European Parliament and of the Council 44 laid down guidelines for the timely development and interoperability of priority corridors and areas of trans-European energy infrastructure in order to contribute to ensuring climate change mitigation in particular achieving the Union’s 2030 targets for energy and climate ch ange and the climate neutrality objective by 2050 at the latest and to ensuring int er connections, ener g y security, market and system integration and competition that benefits all Member States, as well as afforda bility of energy prices. I n particular, Regulation (EU) 2022/869 provide s for the identification of projects of common interest and of projects of mutual interest , facilitates their implementation and determines the conditions for eligibility of th o se projects for Union financial assistance. However, given their cross-border nature, projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest not only create significant positive externalities and foster solidarity, but also entail specific challenges for project promoters, due to their multi-jurisdictional nature, coordination challenges and an often asymmetrical distribution of costs and benefits. They therefore continue to require a Union level framework .  (5) While the objectives of Regulation (EU) 2022/869 remain largely valid, the current trans-European energy networks framework should be adjusted to fully reflect the expected changes to the energy system that will result from the new poli cy context and in particular the 2050 climate neutrality objective and the proposed intermediary target for 2040. In particular , the re is a need for more integrated grid planning to support an increasingly interdependent and decentralised internal energy market , faster permit granting processes and to ensure the security and resilience of cross-border energy infrastructure to be adequately reflected in the revised trans-European energy networks framework. Besides the new political context and objectives, technological development has been rapid in the past decade. That development should be taken into account in the energy infrastructure categories covered by this Regulation, the selection criteria for projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest as well as the priority corridors and areas. At the same time, the provisions of this Regulation should not affect a Member State’s right to determine the conditions for exploiting its energy resources, its choice between different energy sources and the general structure of its energy supply, in accordance with Article 194 of the Treaty .  (6) The implementation of the identified 13 trans - European energy infrastructure priorit y corridors and thematic areas is essential for the achievement of the Union’s energy and climate targets including further market integration, energy security, the 2 050 climate neutrality objective as well as affordability of energy prices . Th o se priorities cover investments in electricity transmission and storage, offshore grids for renewable energy, smart electricity grids, equipment and installation designed to ensure protection and resilience of existing critical network elements, hydrogen transmission , storage and terminals , electrolysers, and the transport and storage of carbon dioxide as well as monitoring, control and digitalisation equipment and installation essential for existing high-voltage network s of cross-border relevance .  (7) The Union’s energy infrastructure should be upgraded in order to increase its resilience against natural or man-made disasters, adverse effects of climate change , deliberate hostile actions and threats to its security, in particular as regards European critical infrastructures pursuant to Directive 2022/2557 of the European Parliament and of the Council 45 .  (8) I n the current geopolitical context, it is important to ensure the uninterrupted flow of electricity across borders to ensure security of supply. T his depends not only on the resilience of interconnectors between Member States , but also on the resilience of critical network elements. Therefore, this Regulation should introduce a new infrastructure category in the form of investments into equipment and installations directly connected to and designed to enhance the critical network elements’ resilience and protection . That new infrastructure category should cover critical network elements , as set out in Regulation (EU) 2019/943 of the European Parliament and of the Council 46 , that support network security and supply security in accordance with the Member States’ crisis scenarios and risk preparedness plans under Regulation (EU) 2019/941 of the European Parliament and of the Council 47 .  (9) While foreign investment can bring benefits such as increased financing options for capital-intensive projects, it can also increase the U nion ’s exposure to energy security related risks such as disruptions or reduced reliability of cross-border flows, in particular whe re such foreign investments originate from third countries with diverging geopolitical interests from the Union . Transparency regarding ultimate beneficiary ownership , including information o n the ultimate investor and participation in the capital as set out in Regulation (EU) 2019/452 of the European Parliament and of the Council 48 , of cross-border energy infrastructure and projects with a cross-border impact is therefore crucial to prevent the Union from becoming dependent on non-trusted third countries and should be taken into consideration when selecting p rojects of c ommon interest and projects of m utual i nterest.  (10) To ensure cost-efficient and accelerated grid development and access to grid s in the Union , non-wire solutions should play a prominent role in addressing system needs next to physical grid reinforcement , as they may be deployed faster and at lower costs. D eploying such technologies should be considered before investing in the expansion of grid infrastructure . To this aim, a new infrastructure category sh ould cover investments in non-wire technologies and digital solutions, including software solutions, where they are deployed on existing critical network elements relevant for cross-border trade, and where bringing quantified benefits for market integration in terms of increasing cross-border capacity.  (11) A decarbonised gas and hydrogen legislative package was adopted with Regulation (EU) 2024/1789 of the European Parliament and of the Council 49 and Directive (EU) 2024/1788 of the European Parliament and of the Council 50 to set common rules at Union level for the transition to renewable and low-carbon gases . The infrastructure categories set out in this Regulation should be fully aligned with the objectives of that package and ensure that energy infrastructure projects have a significant cross-border impact. Where technically possible and most efficient, the possibility of repurposing existing infrastructure and equipment should be taken into account in the development of such projects .  (12) Regional groups (Groups) should be established for the purpose of proposing and reviewing projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest , leading to the establishment of regional lists of projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest . In order to ensure broad consensus, those G roups should include and ensure close cooperation between Member States, national regulatory authorities, project promoters and relevant stakeholders. In the context of that cooperation, national regulatory authorities should, where necessary, advise G roups, inter alia, on the feasibility of the national regulatory aspects of proposed projects and on the feasibility of the proposed timetable for regulatory approval.  (13) In order to increase the efficiency of the network planning and project development process es , cooperation between the G roups should be strengthened. It is necessary that the Commission play an important role in facilitating that cooperation with a view to addressing the possible impact of projects developed within one region on other regions .  (14) In order to complement the G roups , several regional cooperation fora have been established with the support of the Commission. Regional cooperation within and between the fora and the Groups is a key tool to ensur e deeper integration of the European energy system. T he four High-Level Groups cover different European regions also with the involvement of third countries: the Baltic Energy Market Interconnection Plan (BEMIP), the North Seas Energy Cooperation (NSEC), the High-Level Group on Interconnections for South-West Europe (SWE) and the High-Level Group for Central and South-Eastern European Energy Connectivity (CESEC) . Regional cooperation in those fora has been successful in supporting monitoring and accelerating the implementation of key energy infrastructure projects of regional dimension and of market integration actions. Consequently, those regional cooperation fora sh ould be increasingly deployed to support the achievement of the objectives of this Regulation.  (15) A new Union list of projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest (“the Union list”) should be established every two years. Projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest that have been completed or that no longer fulfil the relevant criteria and requirements as set out in this Regulation should not appear on the subsequent Union list.  (16) Existing projects of common interest and existing projects of mutual interest that are to be included in the subsequent Union list should be subject to the same selection process for the establishment of regional lists and for the establishment of the Union list applied to proposed projects unless they have obtained an approval of the competent national regulatory authority or a final investment decision providing sufficient assurance of the construction of the projects or their construction is ongoing and they show sufficient progress in their annual report, in which case they should remain on the Union list .  (17) Whe re existing projects of common interest and existing projects of mutual interest that are to be included in the following Union list are subject to the same selection process for the establishment of regional lists and for the establishment of the Union list applied to proposed projects, the administrative burden should be reduced to the extent possible, for example by using project information submitted previously in the assessment, if still up to date .  (18) Projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest should comply with common, transparent and objective general and specific criteria in view of their contribution to the energy policy objectives. In order to be eligible for inclusion in the Union list, proposed electricity projects, with the exception of smart electricity grids and projects specifically designed to provide protection and resilience to existing critical network elements , should be part of the latest available Union-wide ten-year network development plan. Likewise, proposed hydrogen and electrolyser projects should be part of the latest available Union-wide ten-year network development plan.  (19) S ustainability in terms of the integration of renewable energy sources into the grid or the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, as relevant, is a key criterion for ensur ing that trans-European energy networks policy is coherent with the Union’s targets for energy and climate and the 2050 climate neutrality objectives, taking into account the specificities of each Member State in reaching the climate neutrality objective. To this end, sustainability is one of the assessment criteria to be applied for all project categories.  (20) There is a growing need for stronger market integration and interconnectivity of the networks of the Union with those of the European Economic Area (EEA) and the Energy Community. Therefore, the benefits and costs of projects of mutual interest between a Member State and a country in the EEA or a Energy Community  contracting party should be considered cumulatively for the Union and for the countr y concerned in the EEA or the contracting part y concerned in the Energy Community .  (21) The Union should facilitate infrastructure projects linking Union networks directly with third-country networks which are mutually beneficial and necessary for the energy transition and the achievement of the climate targets, and which also meet the specific criteria of the relevant infrastructure categories pursuant to this Regulation . T o reinforce the focus on cross-border projects and to maintain complementarity with the U nion ’s external policy, in the case of projects of mutual interest , the projects should directly connect a Member State with the first electricity network connection point or the first hydrogen or carbon dioxide connection point in the third country.  (22) As regards projects of mutual interest related to electricity network s , only interconnection projects linking energy systems should be eligible, provided that their transfer capacity could be fully used for market exchanges. It is the responsibility of the respective transmission system operators (TSOs) to assess in advance the impacts of any projects on the grid security and stability in order to confirm that the project can be fully integrated into the electricity networks of the countries concerned .  (23) It is necessary to ensure that projects of mutual interest, which are granted priority treatment, genuinely advance the Union’s internal market, security of supply and climate neutrality objectives . Therefore, p rojects of mutual interest should be eligible for inclusion in the Union list only where the policy framework of a third country invo lved has a high level of convergence and is supported by enforcement mechanisms , and such projects demonstrate a contribution to the Union’s and the third countries’ overall energy and climate policy objectives in terms of security of supply and decarbonisation.  (24) A high level of convergence of the policy framework should be presumed for the EEA or Energy Community contracting p arties or can be demonstrated in case of other third countries through bilateral agreements that include relevant provisions on climate and energy policy objectives on decarbonisation and further assessed by the appropriate G roup with the support of the Commission. In addition, the third country with which the Union cooperates in the development of projects of mutual interest should facilitate a similar timeline for accelerated implementation and other policy support measures, as provided for in this Regulation.  (25) The third country involved should ensure that the section of the project of mutual interest located in the third country and any additional investments necessary for the total benefits of the project of mutual interest to be implemented , such as internal grid reinforcements, are also treated as a priority and are timely deployed to ensure full use of the project.  (26) In order to ensure that projects for the storage of carbon dioxide which involve third countries contribute to cross-border carbon dioxide transport and storage in a manner consistent with the Union’s climate and environmental requirements , such projects should only be eligible if they are necessary for the functioning of cross-border transport and storage of carbon dioxide and where the third country maintains and effectively enforces an adequate legal framework. This legal framework in the third country should ensure the application of standards and safeguards that prevent carbon dioxide leaks and that guarantee the safety and effectiveness of the permanent storage of carbon dioxide for the protection of climate, human health and ecosystems. Those standards and safeguards should provide a level of protection at least equivalent to that laid down in Union law. It should be presumed that the EEA or Energy Community Contracting Parties meet those standards and safeguards.  (27) Projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest should be implemented as quickly as possible and should be closely monitored by the national competent authorities, the Agency and the Groups , while duly observing the requirements for stakeholder participation and environmental legislation and keeping the administrative burden for project promoters to a minimum. Particular attention should be paid to the assessment of risks as regards climate adaptation and as regards physical and cyber security , building where ap p licable on the requirements of Directive (EU) 2022/2557 with regard to the resilience of critical entities and the requirements of D irective 2022/2555 of the European Parliament and of the Council 51 with regard to measures for a high level of c y bersecurity across the Union , and project promoters shou l d report to the national competent authorities on the measures taken resulting from the risks assessed. P roject promoters should also report on the compliance with environmental legislation and demonstrate that projects do ‘no significant harm’ to the environment within the meaning of Article 17 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council 52 . For existing projects of common interest having reached sufficient maturity, those considerations should be taken into account during project selection for the subsequent Union list by the G roups .  (28) The Commission should have the possibility to nominate European coordinators for projects facing particular difficulties or delays, in order to facilitate the implementation of projects which encounter difficulties.  (29) The permit - granting process should neither lead to administrative burdens which are disproportionate to the size or complexity of a project, nor create barriers to the development of the trans-European networks and market access.  (30) Projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest should be given priority status at national level to ensure rapid administrative treatment and urgent treatment in all judicial and dispute resolution procedures relating to them.  (31) Member States that currently do not attribute the highest possible national significance to energy infrastructure projects as regards the permit - granting process , are encouraged to consider introducing such a high national significance, in particular where this could lead to a quicker permit - granting process.  (32) Member States that do not currently have in place accelerated or urgent judicial procedures applicable to energy infrastructure projects should be encouraged to consider introducing such procedures, in particular by evaluating whether that would lead to the quicker implementation of such projects.  (33) Projects concerning hydrogen assets, electrolyser facilities and carbon dioxide assets contribute to energy and climate goals, including with regard to the need to accelerate the deployment of renewable energy and its integration in their energy mix. Therefore, a ll projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest concerning hydrogen, electrolyser facilities, and carbon dioxide assets should be considered to be of public interest from an energy policy perspective , and it should be possible for Member States to consider them as being of overriding public interest , except for cultural heritage and where there is clear evidence that those projects have significant adverse effects on the environment which cannot be mitigated or compensated for .  (34) Due to their role integrating renewable energy assets, flexibility solution s , energy storage and electrification in general, electricity infrastructure projects are considered essential to reach climate neutrality . Therefore, until the Union climate neutrality target is achieved, such projects should be presumed to be of overriding public interest and to serve public health and safety whe re balancing competing legal interests, except for cultural heritage and where there is clear evidence that those projects have significant adverse effects on the environment which cannot be mitigated or compensated for , as provided for in Directive (EU) 2019/944 of the European Parliament and of the Co uncil 53 .  (35) Due to their importance to reach climate neutrality, and their strategic importance as project s o n the Union list, it should be possible for Member States to allow for projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest concerning electricity 54 that have been expressly included in a National Development Plan which was subject to a strategic environmental assessment in accordance with Directive 2001/42 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 55 , and, if it is likely to have a significant impact on Natura 2000 sites, to the appropriate assessment pursuant to Article 6(3) of Directive 92/43/ EEC , to be exempted from environmental impact assessments under Directive 2011/92/ EU, from assessments of their implications on species protection pursuant to Article 12(1) of Directive 92/43/EEC and to Article 5 of Directive 2009/147/EC , and from assessments of their implications for Natura 2000 s ites. Such exemptions should be possible until climate neutrality is achieved.  (36) In order to mitigate any possible impact of such exemptions, following the screening Member State s’ competent authorities should ensure that appropriate and proportionate mitigation measures are applied , considering the use of the best available technologies . W here it is not possible to apply such mitigation measures , competent authorities should ensure that project promoters adopt appropriate compensatory measures to address those effects, which, if other proportionate compensatory measures are not available, may include the payment of monetary compensation for species protection programmes. In addition , where a project is likely to have significant negative effects on the environment of another Member State, the national competent authorit ies should ensure that the Member States concerned ha ve cooperated to identify measures to avoid the significant impacts, or, where needed, to mitigate or compensate them.  (37) In order to speed up the deployment of the trans-European energy network , the conditions for applying specific derogations as set out in Union environmental legislation should be clear . In particular, when assessing whether there are satisfactory alternative solutions to energy projects , the scope of such assessment should be limited to alternative solutions that ensure the achievement of the same objective within the same or similar timeframe and without resulting in significantly higher costs. When comparing the timeframe and the cost of satisfactory alternative solutions, the relevant authorities should be able to take into account the need to deploy projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest in an accelerated and cost-effective manner in accordance with the priorities set out in their integrated national energy and climate plans and updates thereof submitted to the Commission pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999.  (38) Similarly, w hen applying the relevant derogation provided for in Directive 92/43/EEC, it is appropriate that the relevant authorities may , in justified cases and where it can be reasonably demonstrated that the plan or project would not irreversibly affect , before the measures are put into place , the overall coherence of the Natura 2000 network , the environmental integrity of the site is preserved and a high level of protection of the Natura 2000 sites is ensured , allow that compensatory measures are carried out in parallel with the implementation of the plan or project .  (39) In order to reduce complexity, increase efficiency and transparency, and help enhance cooperation among Member States, Member States should ensure that there is one single competent authority responsible for facilitating and coordinating all permit - granting processes towards the issuing of a comprehensive decision, cooperating with other concerned authorities and national competent authorities of other Member States, acting as a sole point of contact for promotors mediating their contact with other authorities, and monitoring the development and delays of projects on the Union list.  (40) To increase the efficiency of procedures , national competent authorities should also be responsible for ensuring that , for hybrid transmission and generation projects , the timeline for permitting aligns to all assets of the project in a manner that expedites the permit-granting process for the generation and transmission assets.  (41) In order to simplify and expedite the permit - granting process for projects on the Union list located in two or more Member States , a unique point of contact amongst the national competent authorities should be jointly designated by the Member States concerned. Having a single authority facilitating the process, and issuing the final comprehensive decision, should lighten the administrative burden for project developers and reduce complexity, increase efficiency and speed up the permit - granting process, especially where Member States provide for joint procedures with aligned timelines and assessments. To ensure effective cross-border cooperation, the Commission should focus on identified interconnection priority projects strengthening the coordination and monitoring of their implementation and permitting. For that purpose , the Commission should support Member States in identifying joint procedures for an effective and efficient permit - granting process .  (42) Member States should be able to include in comprehensive decisions, where appropriate, decisions taken in the context of negotiations with individual landowners to grant access to, ownership of, or a right to occupy, property in the context of spatial planning, which determines the general land use of a defined region, including other developments such as highways, railways, buildings and nature protection areas and which is not undertaken for the specific purpose of the planned project and granting of operational permits. In the context of the permit - granting process, a project of common interest should be able to include related infrastructure to the extent that it is essential for the construction or functioning of the project.  (43) This Regulation, in particular the provisions on permit - granting, public participation and the implementation of projects of common interest, should apply without prejudice to Union and international law, including provisions to protect the environment and human health, and provisions adopted under the Common Fisheries Policy and Integrated Maritime Policy, in particular Directive 2014/89/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council 56 .  (44) It is essential that stakeholders, including civil society, are provided with information and are consulted, in order to ensure the success of projects and to limit objections to them. Despite the existence of established standards ensuring the participation of the public in environmental decision-making procedures, which apply fully to projects of common interest, additional measures should be required to ensure the highest possible standards of transparency and public participation in all relevant issues in the permit - granting process for projects of common interest. Where already covered by national rules under the same or higher standards as in this Regulation, the pre-consultation ahead of the permit-granting proce ss should be optional and duplication of legal requirements should be avoided .  (45) The correct and coordinated implementation of Directives 2001/42/EC and 2011/92/EU and , where applicable, of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Convention on access to information, public participation in decision-making and access to justice in environmental matters 57 , signed in Aarhus on 25 June 1998 (the ‘Aarhus Convention’), and of the Convention on environmental impact assessment in a transboundary context 58 , signed in Espoo on 25 February 1991 (the ‘Espoo Convention’), should ensure the harmonisation of the main principles for the assessment of environmental and climate effects, including in a cross-border context. The Commission has issued guidance to support Member States to streamline the environmental assessment procedures for energy infrastructure and to ensure the coherent application of environmental assessment procedures required under Union law for projects of common interest.  (46) It is important to streamline and improve the permit - granting process, while respecting, to the extent possible and with due regard to the principle of subsidiarity, national competences and procedures for the construction of new energy infrastructure. Given the urgency of developing energy infrastructures, the simplification of the permit - granting process should set a clear time limit for the decision of the relevant authorities regarding the construction of the project. That time limit should stimulate an efficient definition and handling of procedures. This Regulation should establish maximum time limits. However, Member States can strive to achieve shorter time limits where feasible, in particular, as regards projects such as smart grids, which may not require as complex a permit - gran ting process as the one for transmission infrastructure.  (47) The lack of resources of permit -granting authorities and the lack of digitalisation of permit - gran ting processes and data availability are bottlenecks slowing down permit - gran ting process es . Digitalisation and an appropriate use of artificial intelligen ce features are expected to speed up procedures and to increase efficiency of processes by allowing for faster handling of applications and increase transparency through improved access to information on procedural steps and requirements. However, digitalisation of permit-granting processes is lagging behind, with data often scattered across different competent authorities without unified digital processes or platforms, and without interoperability being ensured. That leads to lack of clarity on the status of the applications and hindering the identification of bottlenecks. Therefore, Member States should set up a digital platform at national level for all the steps of the permit-granting processes for renewable energy, storage and grid projects so that the digitalisation of procedures is uniform, interoperable and transparent maximising its benefits in terms of speeding up the permit -granting process . Such platform s should enable project promoters to file applications and check their status, attribute them to the competent authorities, and allow authorities to process them by having access to all relevant data and information , without the need for intermediate paper-based steps. In addition, such platform should allow for the extraction of statistics on the overall progress of permit -granting processes in Member States. Such digital platforms should rely on secure and interoperable means provided through European Digital Identity Wallets, in compliance with the requirements of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014, for natural persons and, in the future, with European Business Wallets, in compliance wit h [Regulation (EU) No XXX/20YY], for legal persons, for enabling electronic identification and authentication, signing or sealing of documents, submission of documents and sending or receiving notifications between competent authorities and economic operators  (48) The competent authorities should be responsible for ensuring compliance with the time limits established in this Regulation. Further, in line with the urgency t o deploy energy infrastructures, and the strategic importance of projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest to achieve the Union’s energy and climate goals and to the extent that the concept of tacit approval exists under national law, Member States should ensure that the lack of a reply by the national competent authorities within the deadline set out in this Regulation, or a lack of a reply by an authority concerned within the deadline established by the national competent authority, leads to the specific opinion, authorisation or permit being tacitly approved or answered positively , with the exception of environmental decisions, and that such conclusion is made public.  (49) The permit - granting process should provide for two procedures , namely the optional pre-application procedure where the work towards a complete application file is delivered and accepted by the national competent authority, and the mandatory statutory permit - granting procedure between the acceptance of the file and the moment the authorities render a comprehensive decision. Within the pre-application phase national competent authorities should carry out a series of tasks. They should screen the project and notify the project promoter of what authorisations, studies, permits and assessments are required to complete the permit - granting process, including the environmental assessments and mitigation or compensation measures that should be deployed. They should define the scope and level of detail of the documentation identified in the screening conclusions, making sure that no subsequent documentation is to be requested from the project promoter save for where a material change has occurred to the project or its surrounding environment that renders the conditions and assumptions used to determine the scope non-applicable. They should draw up a detailed schedule for the permit - granting process. After receiving the draft application file, including all the preparatory documents, they should decide whether the file is deemed complete or requires the missing information in accordance with what was identified at the pre-application procedure .  (50) Where it is considered efficient, the national competent authorities may design the permitting requirements for the permit - gran ting process and public consultations of a certain project to take place in phases, provided the permit - gran ting process is simplified and accelerated.  (51) This Regulation should apply only to the granting of permits for projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest, public participation therein and the regulatory treatment of the projects . Member States should nevertheless be able to adopt national provisions to apply the same or similar rules to other projects that do not have the status of projects of common interest or projects of mutual interest within the scope of this Regulation.  (52) The Union-wide ten-year network development plan process provides a solid basis for the identification of projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest. W hile the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity ( ENTSO for Electricity ) , the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas ( ENTSO for Gas ) , the European Network of Network Operators for Hydrogen ( ENNOH ) and TSOs continue to play an important role in the process, more streamlining and steering is required, in particular as regards defining the scenarios for the future, identifying long-term infrastructure gaps and energy infrastructure bottlenecks and addressing those gaps with most adequate solutions , to increase the political weight , pertinence and robustness of the process. Therefore, the Agency and the Commission should have an increased role in the process for drawing up the Union-wide ten-year network development plans pursuant to Regulations (EU) 2019/943 and (EU) 2024/1789 .  (53) Considering that the selected scenario and its underlying assumptions play a major role in the Union-wide network development planning process , the Commission should play a central role in defining it . That should help streamline the inputs and ensure better compliance with the Union’s policy targets . It is also appropriate for the Union-wide ten-year network development plans to be based on one central scenario, with possible sensitivit y analys es to the scenario in case of change of external conditions , because the main purpose of the scenario is to provide a common basis for the assessment of the infrastructure gaps and benefits of candidate projects of common interest and project of mutual interest . The increased importance of the central scenario require s close involvement of the ENTSO for Electricity, the ENNOH, and the ENTSO for Gas , the Member States and the Agency to ensure that relevant data and information is provided , and that the scenario is aligned with national developments. The Stakeholder Reference Group should continue providing coordinated stakeholder input and advice on scenario development.  (54) The process of identifying infrastructure needs should play a stro nger role in gu i ding planned infrastructure investments. Compared to current practice, the process should be broader and consider more thoroughly cross-sectoral links and non-wire solutions , in order to clearly identif y what solutions best serve the energy system in achieving the energy and climate goals. T he Agency should be more involved in setting the framework for the process and its verification to increase acceptance of the subsequent solutions necessary to address the gaps. The Agency should develop methodologies for the process of identifying infrastructure needs to be conducted by the ENTSO for Electricity and the ENNOH in order to ensure that the outcomes are sufficiently robust and in accordance with the principles set out in this Regulation . The ultimate endorsement of the needs identification report by the decision-making body of the TEN-E Group should be a strong signal to project promoters where the possible projects are needed .  (55) Making the process of identifying infrastructure needs more comprehensive and granular should enable better matchmaking of planned project s with the needs for transmission capacity expansion. It should also enable a follow-up process leading to identifying new solutions which could address unmatched needs. TSOs should be the primary entity to suggest possible projects to address the gaps , but alternative solutions coming from other stakeholders should also be considered. Therefore, a needs matching process should be an outcome of regional cooperation and involve re l e va nt stakeholders in the discussion s . The central role of the Commission in the process should enhance regional cooperation and involvement of Member States, national regulatory authorities, project promoters and other relevant stakeholders in the effort to come up with the most adequate projects, be it non-wire or infrastructure solutions to match any possible unaddressed needs. As a last resort, the Commission should have the right to launch a call for proposals to overcome insufficient progress in addressing persisting gaps. It should be ensured that eligible projects are included as soon as possible in the subsequent national development plans, Union-wide ten-year network development plan and the Union list.  (56) An energy system-wide cost-benefit analysis is necessary to ensure that infrastructure planning reflects the evolving needs of an integrated and decarbonised system, by consistently assessing all relevant costs and benefits in order to identify the most efficient solutions for achieving Union energy and climate objectives. Non-wire solutions , such as dynamic line and transformer rating, advanced power flow control systems or digital twin platforms sh ould play a greater role in addressing network needs both in operation al and expansion terms and should therefore also be covered by the energy system wide cost-benefit analysis .  (57) The Union-wide ten-year network development plan should provide a comprehensive overview of planned infrastructure projects having cross-border impacts in the Union. Non-wire and flexibility solutions should form an intrinsic part of the plan so that it provides a full picture of future investments necessary for optimal operation of the electricity and hydrogen networks. A specific consideration should also be given to projects improving security and resilience of the network.  (58) In carrying out their tasks preceding the adoption of the Union-wide ten-year network development plans, the ENTSO for Electricity and the ENNOH , the Agency and the Commission should conduct an extensive consultation process involving all relevant stakeholders. Those stakeholders should include the European entity for the cooperation of electricity distribution system operators in the European Union , associations involved in electricity, gas and hydrogen markets, heating and cooling, carbon capture and storage and carbon capture and utilisation stakeholders, independent aggregators, demand-response operators, organisations involved in energy efficiency solutions , industrial sectors including transport, digitalisation, and data, a s well as energy consumer associations, the European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change and civil society representatives , as relevant. The Stakeholder Reference Group has proven to be an effective forum of stakeholder cooperation and its further contribution to the Union wide ten-year network development plan should be supported. The consultation should be open and transparent and should be organised i n a timely manner to allow for stakeholders’ feedback in the preparation of key phases of the Union-wide ten-year network development plans, such as infrastructure gaps identification and the cost-benefit analysis methodology for project assessment. The ENTSO for Electricity and the ENNOH should give due consideration to the input received from stakeholders during consultations and should explain how they took that input into account when submitting final proposals .  (59) Energy i nfrastructure planning should properly reflect sector coupling and cross-linkages between energy carriers . T he scenarios ’ development , the process of identifying infrastructure needs and the methodologies for cost-benefit analys is should be based on an integrated, long-term and optimised ‘one energy system’ approach and modelling which us es common assumptions and consistent methodologies. G reater coordination of infrastructure planning across sectors should help prioritise and deploy new infrastructure solutions in a more optimal manner .  (60) The importance of ensuring that only infrastructure projects for which no reasonable alternative solutions exist may receive the status of project of common interest or project of mutual interest also entails that the ‘ energy efficiency first ’ principle should be taken into account in the energy infrastructure planning and in the work of the regional groups in establishing the regional lists of proposed projects. In accordance with the energy efficiency first principle, all relevant alternatives to new infrastructure for ensuring future infrastructure needs, should be considered. S pecial consideration should be given to non-wire or digital solution s, use of demand response or non-fossil flexibility, which could improve overall efficiency of the networks. To this aim, the se solutions should be considered with priority by system operators when assessing projects for system expansion. A cost-efficient utilisation of networks should also be incentivised, notably through the use of locational and time-of-use price signals in network charges and support schemes.  (61) To achieve the Union’s 2050 climate neutrality objective, the Union needs to significantly scale up renewable electricity generation. I nvestment in offshore renewable energy should be increased with the aim of reaching at least 350 GW of offshore renewable generation installed in accordance with the cumulative non-binding regional Member States offshore renewable goals updated in December 2024 and supported in the Commission Communication of 24 October 2023 entitled ‘Delivering on the EU offshore renewable energy ambitions’ 59 . The first Offshore network development plans (ONDPs) published by the ENTSO for Electricity in January 2024 made an important step forward by anchoring Member States offshore regional ambitions in offshore network planning. That should support the identification of cross-border offshore renewable projects , including hybrids and cross-border radials, to ensure an optimized and cost-efficient development of offshore networks at sea-basin level. Th e strategic long-term logic included in the ONDPs should be extended to onshore electricity grids, as well as hydrogen networks.  (62) The assessment of the benefits and costs of the priority offshore grid corridors for renewable energy should support Member States to carry out a preliminary cost-sharing analysis at priority offshore grid corridor level, in order to underpin the subsequent joint political commitments for cross-border offshore grid projects. The Commission guidance on collaborative investment frameworks for offshore projects of 27 June 2024 should inform the assessment of the benefits and costs of the priority offshore grid corridors for renewable energy and may be updated by the Commission, with the involvement of the Member States, relevant TSOs, the Agency and the national regulatory authorities, when considered relevant.  (63) The costs of the development, construction, operation and maintenance of projects of common interest should in general be borne by the users of the infrastructure. The cost allocation should ensure that end-users are not disproportionately burdened, especially where that could lead to energy poverty. Projects of common interest should be eligible for cross-border cost allocation where an assessment of market demand, or of the expected effects on tariffs, indicates that costs cannot be expected to be recovered by the tariffs paid by the infrastructure users.  (64) In an increasingly interconnected internal energy market, clear and transparent rules for cross-border cost-allocation are necessary in order to accelerate investment in cross-border infrastructure and in projects with a cross-border impact. As cross-border energy infrastructure becomes more integrated, more projects deliver benefits beyond the territories where they are built. That makes fair and transparent cost-sharing essential to avoid disproportionate burdens on local consumers. The discussion o n the appropriate allocation of costs should be based on the analysis of the costs and benefits of an infrastructure project carried out on the basis of a harmonised methodology for energy-system-wide analysis, using the central scenario and any sensitivity analysis established for the purpose of the Union-wide ten-year network development plans prepared pursuant to Regulations (EU) 2019/943 and (EU) 2024/1789 , allowing for a robust analysis of the contribution of the project of common interest or mutual interest to the Union energy polic ies of decarbonisation, market integration, competition, sustainability and security of supply. Member States and national regulatory authorities in which at least 10 % of the benefits of a project are located should participate in discussions on cost allocation to ensure that the project can be implemented and its benefits delivered. Furthermore, cross-border cost allocation agreements should consider ex-post arrangements to ensure fair and proportionate participation of non-host countries, provided that such adjustments are clearly defined and structured in a way that safeguards investment certainty.  (65) It is essential to ensure a stable financing framework for the development of projects of common interest while minimising the need for financial support, and at the same time to encourage interested investors, with appropriate incentives and financial mechanisms. In deciding on cross-border cost - allocation, national regulatory authorities should allocate efficiently incurred investment costs, as relevant in view of their national approaches and methodologies for similar infrastructure, across borders in their entirety and include them in the national tariffs . A fterwards, where relevant, national regulatory authorities should determine whether their impact on national tariffs could represent a disproportionate burden for consumers in their respective Member States. The national regulatory authorities should avoid the risks of double support for projects by taking into account actual or estimated charges and revenues. Those charges and revenues should be taken into account only in so far as they relate to the projects and are designed to cover the costs concerned.  (66) To facilitate discussions on cost-sharing between the relevant Member States and third countries a possibility of bundling projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest should be provided . By allowing groups of Member States to treat a project bundle as mutually beneficial, win-win solutions can be fostered , risks and transaction costs in negotiations reduced , and the likelihood of implementation can be increased . Additional support at Union level, for example through the C onnecting Europe Facility , or at regional level using congestion income, could further facilitate such agreements and promote the timely delivery of priority infrastructure.  (67) Regulation (EU) 2019/943 lays down, in Article 19(2), three priority objectives for the use of revenues resulting from the allocation of cross-zonal capacity, namely: (a) guaranteeing the actual availability of the allocated capacity, including firmness compensation; (b) maintaining or increasing cross-zonal capacities through the optimisation of existing interconnectors or by covering costs resulting from network investments relevant to reducing interconnector congestion; and (c) compensating offshore renewable electricity generation plant operators in the circumstances set out therein. TSO s should ensure that all three priority objectives are fulfilled, including the objective in point (b). In order to facilitate the financing of p rojects of c ommon i nterest and p rojects of m utual i nterest that reduce interconnector congestion and to bring predictability and transparency to discussions on cross-border cost allocation decisions pursuant to Article 16 of this Regulation, it is appropriate to require TSOs to set aside a limited share of congestion income for such investments. T hat requirement is without prejudice to the responsibility of TSO s to decide on funding priorities , under the supervision of regulatory authorities and in accordance with the methodology approved pursuant to Article 19(4) of Regulation (EU) 2019/943 . That requirement should not apply where it can be demonstrated that there is no need for additional cross-border capacity to be built at the borders of the Member State concerned.  (68) Where there is no TSO in a Member State, the references to TSOs throughout this Regulation should apply mutatis mutandis to distribution system operators (DSO).  (69) The internal energy market legislation requires that tariffs for access to networks provide appropriate incentives for investment. However, several types of projects of common interest are likely to have externalities that might not be fully captured in, and recovered through, the regular tariff system. In applying the internal energy market legislation, national regulatory authorities should ensure a stable and predictable regulatory and financial framework with incentives for projects of common interest, including long-term incentives, that are commensurate with the level of specific risk of the project. That framework should apply in particular to cross-border projects, innovative transmission technologies for electricity allowing for the large scale integration of renewable energy, of distributed energy resources or of demand response in interconnected networks, and energy technology and digitalisation projects, which are either likely to incur higher risks than similar projects located within one Member State or which promise higher benefits for the Union. Moreover, projects with high operational expenditure should also have access to appropriate incentives for investment. In particular, offshore grids for renewable energy, which serve the dual functionality of electricity interconnectors and connecting renewable offshore generation projects, are likely to incur higher risks than comparable onshore infrastructure projects, due to their intrinsic connection to generation assets which brings regulatory risks, financing risks such as the need for anticipatory investments, market risks and risks pertaining to the use of new innovative technologies.  (70) Regulation (EU) 2022/869 has demonstrated the added value of leveraging private funding through significant Union financial assistance to allow the implementation of projects of Union significance. In the light of the economic and financial situation and budgetary constraints, targeted support should continue under the multiannual financial framework, also with a view to de-risking projects and crowding in private investment, in order to maximise the impact of public funding and its benefits to Union citizens and to attract new investors into the energy infrastructure priority corridors and areas set out in A nnex I to this Regulation, while keeping the budgetary contribution of the Union to a minimum.  (71) Projects of common interest should be eligible for Union financial assistance for studies and, under certain conditions, for works pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2021/1153 of the European Parliament and of the Council 60 in the form of grants or innovative financial instruments to ensure that tailor-made support can be provided to those projects of common interest which are not viable under the existing regulatory framework and market conditions. It is important to avoid any distortion of competition, in particular between projects contributing to the achievement of the same Union priority corridor. Such financial assistance should ensure the necessary synergies with other Union funds available for financ ing smart energy distribution networks, and with the Union renewable energy financing mechanism established by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/1294 61 .  (72) A three-step logic should apply to investments in projects of common interest. First, the market should have the priority to invest. Second, where investments are not made by the market, regulatory solutions should be explored, the relevant regulatory framework should be adjusted where necessary, and the correct application of the relevant regulatory framework should be ensured. Third, where the first two steps are not sufficient to deliver the necessary investments in projects of common interest, it should be possible to grant Union financial assistance where the project of common interest fulfils the applicable eligibility criteria.  (73) Projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest should not be eligible for Union financial assistance where the project promoters, operators or investors are in one of the situations of exclusion referred to in Article 138 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 of the European Parliament and of the Council 62 , such as in cases of a conviction for fraud, corruption or conduct related to a criminal organisation. It should be possible to remove a project of common interest from the Union list if its inclusion in that list was based on incorrect information which was a determining factor for that inclusion, or if the project does not comply with Union law. For a project of common interest located in the Member States benefiting from a derogation under this Regulation, those Member States should ensure, when supporting any applications for financing pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2022/869 for such projects, that the projects do not benefit directly or indirectly persons or entities that are in one of the situation of exclusion as referred to in Article 138 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 .  (74) Grants for works related to projects of mutual interest should be available under the same conditions as for projects of common interest where they contribute to the Union’s overall energy and climate policy objectives and where the decarbonisation objectives of the third country are consistent with the Paris Agreement.  (75) The Union should facilitate energy projects in disadvantaged, less connected, peripheral, outermost or isolated regions to enable access to the trans-European energy networks in order to accelerate the decarbonisation process and reduce dependency on fossil fuels .  (76) In accordance with the European Council conclusions of 4 February 2011 that no Member State should remain isolated from the European gas and electricity networks after 2015 or see its energy security jeopardised by lack of the appropriate connections, this Regulation aims to ensure access to the trans-European energy networks by ending the energy isolation of Cyprus and Malta, that are still not interconnected to the trans-European gas network. That objective should be attained by allowing projects under development or planning that have been granted the status of project of common interest under Regulation (EU) 2022/869 to maintain their status until Cyprus and Malta are interconnected to the trans-European gas network or until 31 Decembe r 2029, whichever is earliest . Apart from contributing to the development of the renewable energy market, the flexibility and resilience of the energy system, and the security of supply, those projects would ensure access to future energy markets, including hydrogen, and contribute to achieving the Union’s overall energy and climate policy objectives.  (77) To ensure consistency of proposed changes under this Regulation with the Union framework on electricity, gases and hydrogen markets, corresponding amendments are proposed to Articles 3 and 11 of Regulation ( EU) 2019/942 of the European Parliament and of the Council 63 , Article 48 of Regulation (EU) 2019/943 and Articles 60 and 61 of Regulation (EU) 2024/1789. Th ose amendments relate to the use of the central scenario in the Union-wide ten-year network development plan, consideration of non-wire solutions and other alternatives to system expansion and clarifying the time scope of the plans. Those Regulations should therefore be amended accordingly .  (78) In order to ensure the timely development of essential energy infrastructure projects for the Union, the third Union list of projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest should remain in force until the first Union list of projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest established pursuant to this Regulation enters into force. Moreover, to enable the development, monitoring and financing of the projects of common interest on the third Union list pursuant to the Regulation (EU) 2022/869 , certain provisions of Regulation (EU) 2022/869 should remain in force and produce effects until the entry into force of the first Union list of projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest established pursuant to this Regulation.  (79) In order to ensure that the Union list is limited to projects which contribute the most to the implementation of the strategic energy infrastructure priority corridors and areas set out in A nnex I to this Regulation, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission in order to amend the annexes to this Regulation so as to establish and review the Union list, while respecting the right of the Member States to approve projects on the Union list related to their territories.  (80) T h e power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission to develop the central scenario , which is a basis for the Union -level network planning.  (81) The power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission to specify the conditions under which TSOs may use congestion income and the conditions under which the objective of Article 19(2) , point (b) , of Regulation (EU) 2019/943 is considered adequately fulfilled .  (82) It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making 64 . In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States' experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts .  (83) The discussions in the G roups are instrumental for the Commission to adopt the delegated acts establishing the Union list. Therefore, it is appropriate that , to the extent possible, the European Parliament and the Council are informed about the results , and may send experts to the meetings of G roups in accordance with the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law Making. Taking into account the need to ensure the achievement of the objectives of this Regulation and, in view of the number of projects on Union lists so far, the total number of projects on the Union list should remain manageable and therefore should not significantly exceed 220.  (84) Therefore, R egulations (EU) 2019/942, (EU) 2019/943 and (EU) 2024/1789 should be amended accordingly , and Regulation (EU) 2022/ 869 should be repealed .  (85) Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely the development and interoperability of trans-European energy networks and connection to such networks that contribute to ensuring climate change mitigation, in particular achieving the Union’s targets for energy and climate and its climate neutrality objective by 2050 at the latest, and to ensuring interconnections, energy security, market and system integration, competition that benefits all Member States, and affordable energy prices, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the scale and effects of the proposed action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives ,  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  CHAPTER I  General provisions  Article 1  Subject matter and scope  1.

In duly justified cases, the Agency may request additional information from competent authorities necessary for carrying out its tasks set out in this paragraph.  7. Where the commissioning of a project on the Union list is delayed when compared to the implementation plan, other than for overriding reasons beyond the control of the project promoter, the following measures shall apply:  (a) in so far as measures referred to in Article 55 (7), point s (a), (b) or (c) , of Directive (EU) 20 24/1788 and Article 51(7), point s (a), (b) or (c) , of Directive (EU) 2019/944 are applicable in accordance with respective national law, national regulatory authorities shall ensure that the investment is carried out;  (b) where the measures of national regulatory authorities pursuant to point (a) of this paragraph are not applicable, the project promoter shall, within 12 months of the date of commissioning set out in the implementation plan, choose a third party to finance or construct all or part of the project;  (c) where a third party is not chosen in accordance with point (b), the Member State or, whe re the Member State has so provided, the national regulatory authority may, within two months of the expiry of the period referred to in point (b), designate a third party to finance or construct the project which the project promoter shall accept;  (d) where the delay compared to the date of commissioning in the implementation plan exceeds 2 6 months, the Commission, subject to the agreement and with the full cooperation of the Member States concerned, may launch a call for proposals open to any third party capable of becoming a project promoter to build the project in accordance with an agreed timetable;  (e) where measures referred to in point (c) or (d) are applied, the system operator in whose area the investment is located shall : provide the implementing operators or investors or third party with all the information required to realise the investment ; connect new assets to the transmission network ; or, where applicable, the distribution network and shall generally make its best efforts to facilitate the implementation of the investment and the secure, reliable and efficient operation and maintenance of the project on the Union list.  8. A project on the Union list may be removed from the Union list in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 3(4) if its inclusion in that list was based on incorrect information which was a determining factor for that inclusion, or the project does not comply with Union law.  9. Projects which are no longer on the Union list shall lose all rights and obligations linked to the status of project of common interest or project of mutual interest provided for in this Regulation.  However, a project which is no longer on the Union list but for which an application file has been accepted for examination by the competent authority shall maintain the rights and obligations laid down in Chapter III, except where the project has been removed from the Union list for the reasons set out in paragraph 8 of this Article.  10. This Article shall be without prejudice to any Union financial assistance granted to any project on the Union list prior to its removal from the Union list.  Article 6  European coordinators  1. Where a project of common interest or a project of mutual interest encounters significant implementation difficulties, the Commission may designate, in agreement with the Member States concerned, a European coordinator for a period of up to one year, renewable twice .  2. The European coordinator shall:  (a) promote the projects, for which they have been designated as a European coordinator , and the cross-border dialogue between the project promoters and all stakeholders concerned;  (b) assist and coordinate all parties as necessary in consulting the stakeholders concerned, discussing alternative routing, where appropriate, and obtaining necessary permits for the projects;  (c) where appropriate, advise project promoters on the financing of the project;  (d) ensure that appropriate support and strategic direction by the Member States concerned are provided for the preparation and implementation of the projects;  (e) s tarting from the date of their designation submit every year, and, where appropriate, upon completion of their mandate, a report to the Commission on the progress of the projects and on any difficulties and obstacles which are likely to significantly delay the commissioning date of the projects ; w here appropriate, the report shall make recommendations to overcome obstacles and difficulties .  The Commission shall transmit the report of the European coordinator referred to in point (e) of the first subparagraph to the European Parliament and the Groups concerned.  3. The European coordinator shall be chosen following an open, non-discriminatory and transparent process and on the basis of a candidate’s experience with regard to the specific tasks they have been assigned for the projects concerned.  4. The decision designating the European coordinator shall specify the terms of reference, detailing the duration of the mandate, the specific tasks and corresponding deadlines, and the methodology to be followed. The coordination effort shall be proportionate to the complexity and estimated costs of the projects.  5. The Member States concerned shall fully cooperate with the European coordinator in the execution of the tasks referred to in paragraphs 2 and 4.  CHAPTER III  Permit-granting and public participation  Article 7  Priority status of projects on the Union list  1. The Union list shall establish, for the purposes of any decisions issued in the permit - granting process, the necessity of projects on the Union list from an energy policy and climate perspective , without prejudice to the exact location, routing or technology of the project .  The first subparagraph shall not apply to competing projects or to projects that have not reached a sufficient degree of maturity to provide a project specific cost-benefit analysis as referred to in Section 2, point (1)(d), of Annex III.  2. For the purpose of ensuring efficient administrative processing of the application files related to projects on the Union list, project promoters and all authorities concerned shall ensure that those files are treated in the most rapid way possible in accordance with Union and national law .  3. Projects on the Union list shall have the status of the highest national significance possible, where such a status exists in national law and be treated as such in the permit - granting process, including those relating to environmental assessments, in spatial planning, and in obtaining rights of way and expropriation of necessary land .  4. All dispute resolution procedures, litigation, appeals and judicial remedies related to projects on the Union list in front of any national courts, tribunals, panels, including mediation or arbitration, where they exist in national law, shall be treated as urgent, if and to the extent to which national law provides for such urgency procedures .  5. With regard to the environmental impacts addressed in Article 6(4) of Directive 92/43/EEC and Article 4(7) of Directive 2000/60/EC, provided that all the conditions set out in those Directives are fulfilled, projects on the Union list falling under the infrastructure categories referred to in points (2), (3), and (4) of Annex II to this Regulation shall be considered as being of public interest from an energy policy perspective, and may be considered as having an overriding public interest .  Where the opinion of the Commission is required in accordance with Article 6(4) of Directive 92/43/EEC, the Commission and the national competent authority referred to in Article 8 of this Regulation shall ensure that the decision with regard to the overriding public interest of a project is taken within the time limits set in Article 10(1) and (2) of this Regulation .  The first and second subparagraphs shall not apply to competing projects or to projects that have not reached a sufficient degree of maturity to provide a project specific cost-benefit analysis as referred to in Section 2, point (1)(d), of Annex III.  6. U ntil climate neutrality is achieved at Union level , in the permit-granting procedure, the planning, construction and operation of projects falling within the infrastructure category referred to in Annex II point (1) fall under the provision of A rticle 8( 8 ) of Directive (EU) 2019/944 and are presumed as being in the overriding public interest and serving public health and safety when balancing legal interests in individual cases for the purposes of Article 6(4) and Article 1 6 (1), point (c), of Directive 92/43/EEC, Article 4(7) of Directive 2000/60/EC and Article 9(1), point (a), of Directive 2009/147/EC . Member States may, in duly justified and specific circumstances, restrict the application of the presumption to certain parts of their territory, to certain types of technology or to projects with certain technical characteristics.  Member States shall ensure that, in the planning and permit-granting process, the construction and operation of projects falling under the infrastructure category referred to in point (1) of Annex II are given priority when balancing legal interests in individual cases for other purposes than the ones referred in the first subparagraph with the exception of cultural heritage on the basis of legal criteria to ensure harmonized implementation.  The first subparagraph shall not apply to competing projects or to projects that have not reached a sufficient degree of maturity to provide a project specific cost-benefit analysis as referred to in Section 2, point (1)(d), of Annex III.  7. Until climate neutrality is achieved at Union level , with regard to projects on the Union list falling under the infrastructure categories referred to in point (1) of Annex II to this Regulation which are expressly included in a National Development Plan that has been subject to a strategic environmental assessment in accordance with Directive 2001/42, and, where it is likely to have a significant impact on Natura 2000 sites, to the appropriate assessment pursuant to Article 6(3) of Directive 92/43/EEC, Member States may , insofar as the project complies with and does not go beyond the framework of the assessed National Development Plan :  (a) exempt those projects from the environmental impact assessment under Article 2(1) of Directive 2011/92/EU, and  (b) exempt those projects from an assessment of their implications for Natura 2000 sites pursuant to Article 6(3) of Directive 92/43/EEC and from the assessment of their implications on species protection pursuant to Article 12(1) of Directive 92/43/EEC and to Article 5 of Directive 2009/147/EC .  For projects located in, or crossing, Natura 2000 sites and areas designated under national protection schemes for nature and biodiversity conservation, the exemptions referred to in the first subparagraph shall only be applicable in case there are no proportionate alternatives for their deployment, taking into account the objectives of the site. Projects referred to in Annex II point 1(c) shall exclude Natura 2000 sites and areas designated under national protection schemes.  8. Where Member States apply the exemptions under paragraph 7 , they shall ensure that rules on effective mitigation measures to be adopted for the projects on the Union list falling under the infrastructure categories referred to in Annex II point (1) are identified based on the National Development Plan, in order to avoid the adverse environmental impact that may arise or, where that is not possible, to significantly mitigate it. Member States shall ensure that the appropriate mitigation measures are applied in a timely manner to ensure compliance with the obligations laid down in Article 6(2) of Directive 92/43/EEC and Article 4(1), point (a)(i), of Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and to avoid deterioration and achieve good ecological status or good ecological potential in accordance with Article 4(1), point (a), of Directive 2000/60/EC.  Compliance with the rules referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph and the implementation of the appropriate mitigation measures by the individual projects shall result in the presumption that projects are not in breach of the provisions mentioned in that subparagraph, without prejudice to paragraph 10 of this Article.  9. Member States shall ensure public participation regarding the National Development Plan in accordance with Articles 6 and 7 of Directive 2001/42/EC, including identifying the public affected or likely to be affected as well as the Member States that may be affected by the implementation of that Plan and the projects on the Union list falling under the infrastructure categories referred to in point (1) of Annex II to this Regulation included in that Plan.  10. For projects for which Member States decide to apply exemptions under paragraph 7 , the competent authorities shall carry out a screening to identify:  (a) if the project is likely to give rise to significant adverse effects, which were not identified during the environmental assessment of the National Development Plan carried out pursuant to Directive 2001/42/EC and, where relevant, to Directive 92/43/EEC.  (b) if the project falls within the scope of Article 7 of Directive 2011/92/EU and Article 2 of the Convention on environmental impact assessment in a transboundary context due to its likelihood of significant effects on the environment in another Member State or due to the request of a Member State which is likely to be significantly affected.  This screening referred to in the first subparagraph shall be finalised within 45 days from the notification of the project promoter referred to in paragraph 5 of Article 10.  11. Where a project on the territory of a Member State is likely to have significant effects on the environment of other Member States, the Member State where the project is located shall ensure the application of Article 7 of Directive 2011/92/EU and Articles 2 to 7 of the Convention on environmental impact assessment in a transboundary context.  12. Where the screening process identifies a project to be highly likely to give rise to significant unforeseen adverse effects as referred to in paragraph 10 of this Article, the competent authorities shall inform the project promoter that assessments referred to in points (a) and (b) of paragraph 7 of this Article are re quired and ensure that on the basis of existing data, appropriate and proportionate mitigation measures are applied for these projects to ensure compliance with Articles 12(1) of Directive 92/43/EEC and Article 5 of Directive 2009/147/EC. Where it is not possible to apply such mitigation measures, the competent authorities shall ensure that project promoters adopt appropriate compensatory measures to address those effects, which, if other proportionate compensatory measures are not available, may take the form of a monetary compensation for species protection programmes, in order to secure or improve the conservation status of the species affected.  13. When assessing whether satisfactory alternative solutions to projects on the Union list falling under the infrastructure categories referred to in points (2), (3) and (4) of Annex II to this Regulation , exist for the purposes of Articles 6(4) and Article 16(1) of Directive 92/43/EEC, Article 4(7), point (d), of Directive 2000/60/EC and Article 9(1) of Directive 2009/147/EC, the condition of having no satisfactory alternatives shall be fulfilled if there are no satisfactory alternative solutions capable of achieving the same objective of the project in question, in terms of the development of the same capacity through the same technology within the same or similar timeframe and without resulting in significantly higher costs.  14. When implementing compensatory measures for projects on the Union list falling under the infrastructure categories referred to in points (2), (3) and (4) of Annex II to this Regulation for the purpose of Article 6(4) of Directive 92/43/EEC, Member States may , in justified cases and where it can be reasonably demonstrated that the plan or project would not irreversibly affect the ecological processes essential for maintaining the structure and functions of the site and would compromise the overall coherence of the Natura 2000 network before compensatory measures are put into place, allow for such compensatory measures to be carried out in parallel with the implementation of the project. Member States may allow , in accordance with the precautionary principle, for those compensatory measures to be adapted over time, depending on whether the significant negative effects are expected to arise in the short, medium or long term.  15. Regarding the assessment , satisfactory alternative solutions to projects falling under the infrastructure category referred to in point (1) of Annex II to this Regulation and the implementation of compensatory measures for those projects, Article 8a of Directive (EU) 2019/944 shall apply.  Article 8  Organisation of the permit-granting process  1. E ach Member State shall ensure that one single national competent authority is responsible for:  (a) acting as the sole point of contact for project promoters in the permit - grant ing process, replying to their queries, mediating all contacts with the authorities concerned and support them with knowledge and information aiming at the fastest process possible;  (b) receiving permitting -granting applications from promoters of projects on the Union list and all relevant documents in electronic form and disseminating them across authorities concerned;  (c) facilitating and coordinating the permit - granting process of projects on the Union list in their territory with other authorities concerned, determining in cooperation with them, what authorisations, permits and assessments are required to complete the permit - granting process and reach a comprehensive decision in accordance with paragraph 3. This includes the scope and level of detail of the studies, assessment and documentation that project promoters are expected to produce ;  (d) cooperating and communicating with national competent authorities of other Member States to facilitate and coordinate the permit - granting process for projects on the Union list in their territory, and permitting authorities in third countries as regards projects of mutual interest, including : aligning public consultations for cross-border projects, in accordance with Article 9(5) ; sharing information on likely significant transboundary impacts, in accordance with Article 9(6) ; aligning the timeline and requirements for studies, permits or authorisations to be conducted ; and , organising the pre-application procedure in accordance with Article 10( 9 );  (e) monitoring the development and delays of projects o n the Union list with in their territory of responsibility , including by receiving and approving reports submitted by project promoters in accordance with Article 5(4) and reporting to the Agency and relevant Groups on the development and delays of projects o n the union list located in their territory in accordance with Article 5(5) .  In case of update to, or changes of, the designated national competent authority, Member States shall notify the Commission as soon as the change is decided and inform when such changes produce effects.  2. The responsibilities of the national competent authority referred to in paragraph 1 and the tasks related to it may be delegated to another authority, per project on the Union list or per particular category of projects on the Union list, or per geographical area, provided that:  (a) the national competent authority notifies the Commission of that delegation and the information therein is made easily available to the public including on the website referred to in Article 9(7);  (b) only one authority is responsible per project, or category of projects, on the Union list, and it is the sole point of contact for the project promoters, taking upon all responsibilities in the process leading to the comprehensive decision within the legal deadline provided in Article 10(2) and coordinates the submission of all relevant documents and information including to any other authority concerned;  (c) irrespective of the delegation , the national competent authority remains responsible to aggregate the reports submitted by project promoters in accordance with Article 5(4) and report to the Agency and relevant Groups in accordance with Article 5(5).  The national competent authority may also retain the responsibility to establish time limits, without prejudice to the time limits set in Article 10(1) and (2).  3. The national competent authority shall ensure the issuing of the comprehensive decision within the time limits set out in Article 10(1) and (2).  Member States shall choose among the following schemes, taking into account which scheme is most effective in light of national law, national planning and permit-granting process specificities, and whether it can be implemented in a manner that contributes to the most efficient and timely issuing of the comprehensive decision:  (a) integrated scheme:  (i) the comprehensive decision shall be issued by the national competent authority and shall be the sole legally binding decision arising from the statutory permit - granting proce ss ;  (ii) w here other authorities are concerned by the project, they may, in accordance with national law, give their opinion as input to the procedure, which shall be taken into account by the national competent authority;  (b) coordinated scheme:  (i) the comprehensive decision comprises multiple individual legally binding decisions issued by the several authorities concerned and is coordinated centrally by the national competent authority ;  (ii) t he national competent authority may establish a working group where all authorities concerned are represented in order to draw up the screening or the detailed schedule for the permit - granting process in accordance with Article 10( 9 ), point (b), and to monitor and coordinate its implementation ;  (iii) the national competent authority shall, after consulting the other authorities concerned, establish on a case-by-case basis a reasonable time limit within which the individual decisions shall be issued with the aim to minimise the duration of the process without prejudice to time limits set out in Article 10(1) and (2) ;  (iv) the national competent authority shall be able to take an individual decision on behalf of another authority concerned, where the decision by that authority is not delivered within the set time limit and where the delay cannot be adequately justified. The national competent authority may also disregard an individual decision of another authority concerned if it considers that the decision is not sufficiently substantiated with regard to the underlying evidence presented by th at authority concerned ;  (c) collaborative scheme:  (i) the comprehensive decision shall be comprised of multiple individual legally binding decisions issued by several authorities concerned and coordinated by the national competent authority ;  (ii) t he national competent authority may establish a working group where all authorities concerned are represented in order to draw up the screening or the detailed schedule for the permit - granting process in accordance with Article 10( 9 ), and to monitor and coordinate its implementation ;  (iii) the national competent authority shall, after consulting the other authorities concerned, establish on a case-by-case basis a reasonable time limit, within which the individual decisions shall be issued with the aim to minimise the duration of the process, without prejudice to the time limits set in Article 10(1) and (2 ) ;  (iv) the national competent authority shall monitor compliance with the time limits by the authorities concerned and, in case of delays, shall take measures with the aim to minimise the duration of the process ;  (v) w here a Member State chooses the collaborative scheme, it shall inform the Commission of its reasons.  Authorities concerned shall, in accordance with the permitting scheme chosen by Member States, either delegate the necessary competences to the national competent authority or facilitate cooperation and collaboration with the national competent authority to ensure the issuing of the comprehensive decision within the time limits set in Article 10(1) and (2).  Where an authority concerned does not expect to deliver an individual decision within the set time limit, that authority shall immediately inform the national competent authority, providing reasons for the delay. Subsequently, the national competent authority shall set another time limit within which that individual decision shall be issued, in compliance with the overall time limits set in Article 10(1) and (2).  4. Member States may apply the schemes set out in paragraph 3 to onshore and offshore projects on the Union list.  In the case of projects on the Union list that are intrinsically linked to generation assets, such as the projects included in the infrastructure categories provided by points (1)(b) or (h) of Annex II, the national competent authority shall be responsible for coordinating the permit-granting process of the respective project on the Union list with the permitting of the generation assets so that the timelines are cohesive and together aim at the most efficient and timely permitting of all assets related to the project.  5. Where a project on the Union list is located i n the territory of two or more Member States, their respective national competent authorities shall jointly appoint one of them to act as a unique point of contact, responsible for facilitating the exchange of information between the national competent authorities and other authorities concerned on the permit - granting process, as well as, issuing the final comprehensive decisions in cooperation with the other national competent authorities concerned.  Member States shall endeavour to provide a joint procedure which facilitates the cooperation between their respective national competent authorities concerned, create procedural synergies and align timelines to facilitate the permit-granting process for projects, particularly with regard to the assessment of environmental impacts, and the public consultations required under Article 9.  Upon request from Member States, the Commission shall play the role of a facilitator to support cooperation between concerned national competent authorities. The Commission shall facilitate agreement on a unified joint procedure by providing an opinion and making recommendations on procedural aspects.  Article 9  Transparency and public participation  1. By 24 October 2027, the Member State or national competent authority shall, where necessary, in collaboration with other authorities concerned, publish an updated manual of procedures for the permit - granting process applicable to projects on the Union list to include at least the information specified in point (1) of Annex VI. The manual shall not be legally binding, but it shall refer to or quote relevant legal provisions. The national competent authorities shall, where relevant, cooperate and find synergies with the authorities of neighbouring countries with a view to align timelines and facilitating the permit - granting process for projects, including for the development of the manual of procedures.  2. Without prejudice to public participation requirements under environmental law, the Aarhus Convention, the Espoo Convention and relevant Union law, all parties involved in the permit - granting process shall follow the principles for public participation set out in point (3) of Annex VI.  3. The project promoter shall, within an indicative period of three months following the start of the permit - granting process pursuant to Article 10( 5 ), draw up and submit a concept for public participation to the national competent authority, following the process outlined in the manual referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article and in accordance with the guidelines set out in Annex VI.  4. The national competent authority shall request modifications or approve the concept for public participation within three months of receipt of the concept, taking into consideration, without the need for repetition, of any form of public participation and consultation that took place before the start of the permit - granting process, to the extent that such public participation and consultation has fulfilled the requirements of this Article.  Where the project promoter intends to make significant changes to an approved concept for public participation, it shall inform the national competent authority thereof. In that case the national competent authority may request additional modifications.  5. Where it is not already required under national law , the project promoter shall carry out at least one early-stage public consultation, before the submission of the final and complete permitting application to the national competent authority pursuant to Article 10( 10 ). The public consultation may be carried out in combination with any public consultation after submission of the request for development consent pursuant to Article 6(2) of Directive 2011/92/EU.  6. The public consultation required in the previous paragraph shall comply with the minimum requirements set out in point (5) of Annex VI and shall inform the stakeholders referred to in point (3)(a) of Annex VI about the project at an early stage and shall help to identify the most suitable location , trajectory or technology, including, where relevant, in view of adequate climate adaptation and security considerations for the project, all impacts relevant under Union and national law, and the relevant issues to be addressed in the application file.  7. Without prejudice to the procedural and transparency rules in Member States, the project promoters shall publish on the website referred to in paragraph 10 a report summarising the results of activities relate d to public participation as regards the project including any activities pre-dating the early public consultation,  and explaining how the opinions expressed in the public consultations were taken into account, showing the amendments made in the location, trajectory and design of the project, or providing reasons why such opinions have not been taken into account.  The project promoter shall submit the report together with the application file to the national competent authority. The comprehensive decision shall take due account of the result of this report.  8. For cross-border projects involving two or more Member States, the public consultations carried out pursuant to paragraph 5 in each of the Member States concerned shall, to the extent possible, take place within a period of no more than two months from each other, and, where possible, be combined.  9. For projects likely to have a significant transboundary impact in one or more neighbouring Member States, to which Article 7 of Directive 2011/92/EU and the Espoo Convention are applicable, the relevant information shall be made available to the national competent authorities of the neighbouring Member States concerned. The national competent authorities of the neighbouring Member States concerned shall indicate, in the notification process where appropriate, whether they, or any other authority concerned, wishes to participate in the relevant public consultation procedures.  10. The project promoter shall establish and regularly update a dedicated project website with relevant information about the project of common interest, which shall be linked to the Commission website and the transparency platform referred to in Article 2 6 and which shall meet the requirements specified in point (6) of Annex VI. National competent authorities shall check the fulfilment of this obligation by the project promoters and take measures ensuring compliance whe r e necessary.  Article 10  Duration and implementation of the permit-granting process  1. The permit - granting process shall provide for the following two procedures:  (a) the optional pre-application procedure, covering the period between the start of the permit - granting process and the acceptance of the submitted complete application file by the national competent authority, which shall take place within a maximum period of 24 months;  (b) the mandatory statutory permit - granting procedure, covering the period from the date of acceptance of the submitted complete application file until the date of the comprehensive decision, which shall not exceed 18 months.  With regard to the first subparagraph, point (b), where possible, Member States may provide for a statutory permit-granting procedure that is shorter than 18 months.  2. The national competent authority shall ensure that the combined duration of the two procedures referred to in paragraph 1 does not exceed a period of 42 months.  However, where the national competent authority considers that one or both of the procedures will not be completed within the time limits set out in paragraph 1, it may extend one or both of those time limits before their expiry and on a case-by-case basis. The national competent authority shall not extend the combined duration of the two procedures for more than six months other than in exceptional circumstances.  Where the national competent authority extends the time limits, it shall inform the Group concerned of the reasons for such extension and present it with the measures taken, or to be taken, for the conclusion of the permit-granting process, with the least possible delay. The Group may request that the national competent authority reports regularly on the progress achieved in that regard and provide reasons for any delays.  3. Member States shall ensure that the national competent authorities referred to in Article 8(1) have adequate technical, financial and human resources to render a comprehensive decision within the timeframe indicated in Article 10(2) .  4. Member States shall ensure that, i n the permit-granting procedure referred to in paragraph 1, :  (a) the lack of reply by the national competent authorities within the deadline established in paragraph 2 results in the comprehensive decision to be considered as approved ;  (b) the lack of reply by other authorities concerned within the reasonable time limit established by a national competent authority in accordance with Article 8(3), results in their specific opinion , authorisation or permit to be considered as granted or answered positively .  This paragraph does not produce effects for environmental decisions, and where the principle of administrative tacit approval does not exist in the legal system of the Member State concerned.  All decisions shall be made publicly available, including final decisions granted tacitly following the lack of reply by the relevant competent authorities or authorities concerned.  5. When requesting the start of the permit - granting process, the project promoters shall notify the project to the national competent authority of each Member State where the project is located, including in Member States where the project crosses their exclusive economic zone, in written or electronic form and include a reasonably detailed outline of the project.  Within one month of receipt of the notification, the national competent authority shall, in electronic form, either:  (a) i ssue an acknowledge ment of the receipt ; or  (b) i f the project is not considered to be mature enough to enter the permit - granting process , reject the notification, and provide the reasons for its decision including on behalf of other authorities concerned.  The date of the acknowledgement of receipt shall mark the start of the permit-granting process. Where two or more Member States are concerned, the date of the acceptance of the last notification by the national competent authority concerned shall mark the start of the permit-granting process.  Member States shall ensure that dedicated digital platforms are established to manage permitting applications, permitting processes, ongoing permitting decisions, and decisions issued in an easily accessible format.  Those platforms shall provide access to the relevant environmental and geological data and decisions available in the central online portal referred to in Article 10(3) of Regulation [xxxxx] 66 of the European Parliament and of the Council.  6. National competent authorities shall ensure that the permit - granting process is accelerated in accordance with this Chapter for each category of projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest. To that end, the national competent authorities shall adapt their requirements for the start of the permit - granting process and for the acceptance of the complete application file, in accordance with the relevant project category, their nature, dimension, lack of requirement for environmental assessment, or any other assessments under national law, or the fact that they may require less authorisations and approvals to reach the ready-to-build phase.  As such, national competent authorities may decide that the pre-application procedure referred to in paragraphs 1 and 6 of this Article is not necessary in case the project promoter does not require this period to perform studies, assessments and gather data for completing their permitting application file.  7. The national competent authorities shall take into consideration , in the screening for establishing the requirements for the permit - granting process , any studies conducted and permits or authorisations issued up to five years before the project entered the permit - granting process in accordance with this Article, including assessments conducted for the deployment of other projects that are relevant and can be reused, and shall not require unnecessary or duplicate studies , assessments, permits or authorisations.  8. In Member States where the determination of a route or location undertaken solely for the specific purpose of a planned project, including the planning of specific corridors for grid infrastructures, cannot be included in the permit - gran ting process leading to the comprehensive decision, the corresponding decision shall be taken within a separate period of six months, starting on the date of submission of the final and complete application documents by the project promoter.  9. The pre-application procedure shall include : the screening and scoping of the required studies, reports and documentation expected from the project promoter ; the drawing up of the detailed schedule ; and , the verification of the draft application file , under the following steps :  (a) a s soon as possible and no later than three months following the notification by the project promoter referred to in paragraph 5, the national competent authority shall determine, and notify the project promoter of the authorisations, permits and assessments required to complete permit - granting process .  The notification made by the national competent authority shall include the checklist referred to in point (1)(e) of Annex VI, and where relevant, its content shall be established in cooperation with the other authorities concerned and with national competent authorities in the other Member States where the project is located, including if the project crosses their exclusive economic zone.  Where applicable the notification shall detail the conditions for the project to benefit from the exemption of Article 7(7) and identify:  (i) whether the project is highly likely to give rise to significant unforeseen adverse effects in view of the environmental sensitivity of the geographical areas where it is planned, which were not identified during the environmental assessment of the National Development Plans carried out pursuant to Directive 2001/42/EC and, where relevant, to Directive 92/43/EEC ;  (ii) the appropriate and proportionate mitigation measures, or monetary compensation for species protection programs applicable to the project in accordance with Article 7(8) ;  (iii) whether any part of the project is likely to produce significant effects on the environment in another Member State ; in such a case the national competent authority of the Member State in which the project is located shall ensure the application of Article 7 of Directive 2011/92/EU and Articles 2 to 7 of the Convention on environmental impact assessment in a transboundary context ;  (b) t he notification shall also indicate whether the national competent authority approves, or amends, the concept for public participation submitted by the project promoter in accordance with Article 9(3). During the screening period, the national competent authority shall, in cooperation with other authorities concerned, determine the scope and level of detail of the studies, reports and documentation s, including assessments required for the environmental permitting of the project, that the project promoter is expected to produce and submit as part of the complete application file.  Neither the national competent authority, nor any of the authorities concerned shall subsequently request any additional information, studies, reports or assessments than the ones determined in this initial screening process, except where a material change has occurred to the project or its surrounding environment. Where such a material change occurs, the national competent authority may request additional information from the project promoter based on a reasoned justification;  (c) t he national competent authority shall draw up, in close cooperation with the project promoter and other authorities concerned and the national competent authorities in the other Member States where the project is located, including if the project crosses their exclusive economic zone, and taking into account the results of the activities carried out under point (a) of this paragraph, a detailed schedule for the permit - granting process in accordance with the guidelines set out in point (2) of Annex VI ;  (d) u pon receipt of the draft application file, the national competent authority may , on its own behalf or on behalf of other authorities concerned, request the project promoter to submit missing information relating to the requested elements referred to in point (a) within a maximum deadline of one month.  The pre-application procedure shall include the preparation of any environmental reports by the project promoters, as necessary, including the climate adaptation and cyber and physical security documentation and assessments .  In cooperation with the project promoter and, as necessary, other authorities concerned or other national competent authorities of other Member States where the project is located, including if the project crosses their exclusive economic zone, the national competent authority may design the requirements for the permit-granting process of a certain project, and the public consultation timeline set out in point (4) of Annex VI, in phases, provided it does not delay the overall development of the project and ensures that the permit-granting process is simplified and accelerated. The maximum deadlines of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall apply for each of the phases.  Within one month of submission of the missing information referred to in the first subparagraph, point (d), the competent authority shall accept for examination the complete application in written or electronic form or on dedicated digital platforms, starting the statutory permit-granting procedure referred to in paragraph 1, point (b).  10.

Those reference values may be used by the ENTSO for Electricity and the ENNOH for the cost-benefit analyses carried out for subsequent Union-wide ten-year network development plans.  CHAPTER V  Offshore grids for renewable integration  Article 15  Offshore grid planning  1. By [ within 6 months after entry into force ], Member States, with the support of the Commission, within their specific priority offshore grid corridors, set out in Section 2 of Annex I, taking into account the specificities and development in each region, shall update the non-binding agreement to cooperate on goals for offshore renewable generation to be deployed within each sea basin by 2030, 2040 and 2050 , in accordance with their national energy and climate plans, and the offshore renewable potential of each sea basin. The agreement shall include renewable offshore hydrogen goals as applicable.  As part of the non-binding agreements, Member States, with the support of the Commission, within their specific priority offshore grid corridors, set out in Section 2 of Annex I, shall also consider whether specific cross-border goals, such as for hybrid or cross-border radial projects, should be established between two or more Member States in their respective national energy and climate plans with the aim to achieve the goals for offshore renewable generation to be deployed within each sea basin in the most efficient manner.  That non-binding agreement shall be made in writing as regards each sea basin linked to the territory of the Member States, and shall be without prejudice to the right of Member States to develop projects on their territorial sea and exclusive economic zone. The Commission shall provide guidance for the work in the Groups.  2. By [ within 12 months after entry into force ], and every four years thereafter, as part of the following ten-year network development plan thereafter, the ENTSO for Electricity, with the involvement of the relevant TSOs, the national regulatory authorities, the Member States and the Commission, and in accordance with the non-binding agreement referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, shall develop and publish, as a separate report which is part of the Union-wide ten-year network development plan, high-level strategic integrated offshore network development plans for each sea-basin, in line with the priority offshore grid corridors referred to in Annex I, taking into account environmental protection and other uses of the sea.  In the development of the high-level strategic integrated offshore network development plans within the timeline provided for in paragraph 1, the ENTSO for Electricity shall consider the non-binding agreements referred to in paragraph 1 for the development of the Union-wide ten-year network development plan central scenario.  The high-level strategic integrated offshore network development plans shall provide a general overview of offshore generation capacities potential and resulting offshore grid needs, including the potential needs for interconnectors, hybrid projects, radial connections, reinforcements, and hydrogen infrastructure.  3. The high-level strategic integrated offshore network development plans shall be consistent with regional investment plans published pursuant to Article 34(1) of Regulation (EU) 2019/943 and integrated within the Union-wide ten-year network development plans in order to ensure coherent development of onshore and offshore grid planning and the necessary reinforcements.  4. At the latest every four years after the adoption of the non-binding agreement with paragraph 1, the Member States, shall update their non-binding agreements referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, including in view of the results of the application of the latest cost-benefit and cost-sharing to the priority offshore grid corridors .  5. After each update of the non-binding agreements in accordance with paragraph 4, for each sea basin, the ENTSO for Electricity shall update the high level strategic integrated offshore network development plans within the next Union-wide ten-year network development plan as referred to in paragraph 2.  Article 16  Guidance on collaborative investment frameworks for offshore energy projects  1. T he Commission shall, with the involvement of the Member States, relevant TSOs, the Agency and the national regulatory authorities, consider whether an update of the guidance on collaborative investment frameworks for offshore energy projects, which provides for a specific cost-benefit and cost-sharing for the deployment of the sea-basin integrated offshore network development plans referred to in Article 15(2) in accordance with the non-binding agreements referred to in Article 14(1) , is necessary and, where relevant, publish an updated version of the guidance. This guidance shall be compatible with Article 17(1). The Commission shall update its guidance when appropriate, taking into account the results of its implementation.  2. The ENTSO for Electricity, with the involvement of the relevant TSOs, the Agency, the national regulatory authorities and the Commission, shall update the results of the application of the cost-benefit and cost-sharing to the priority offshore grid corridors, including whenever the Commission publishes any update to the guidance for a specific cost-benefit and cost-sharing for the deployment of the sea-basin integrated offshore network development plans referred to in Article 15(2) in accordance with the non-binding agreements referred to in Article 15(1).  CHAPTER VI  Regulatory framework  Article 17  Enabling investments with a cross-border impact  1. The efficiently incurred investment costs, which exclude maintenance costs, related to a project of common interest falling under the energy infrastructure categories set out in point s (1)(a), (b), (c), (d), (e) , (f) and (h) of Annex II, and projects of common interest falling under the energy infrastructure category set out in point (2) of Annex II, where they fall under the competence of national regulatory authorities in each Member State concerned, shall be borne by the relevant TSO, HNO, other operators or the project promoters of the transmission infrastructure of the Member States to which the project provides a net positive impact, and, to the extent not covered by congestion rents or other charges, be paid for by network users through tariffs for network access in that or those Member States.  2. The provisions of this Article shall apply to a project of common interest falling under the energy infrastructure categories set out in Article 2 7 and point s (1)(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) and (h) and point (2) of Annex II, where at least one project promoter requests the relevant national authorities their application for the costs of the project.  Projects falling under the energy infrastructure category set out in point (1)(g) of Annex II may benefit from the provisions of this Article where at least one project promoter requests its application from the relevant national authorities.  Where a project has several project promoters, the relevant national regulatory authorities shall without delay request all project promoters to submit the investment request jointly in accordance with paragraph 4.  3. For a project of common interest to which paragraph 1 applies, the project promoters shall keep all relevant national regulatory authorities regularly informed, at least once per year from inclusion of the project on the Union list , and until the project is commissioned, of the progress of that project and the identification of costs and the impact associated with it.  4. As soon as such a project of common interest has reached sufficient maturity , and is estimated to be ready to start the construction phase within the next 36 months, the project promoters, after having consulted the TSOs from the Member States which receive a significant net positive impact from it, shall submit an investment request. That investment request shall include a request for a cross-border cost allocation and shall be submitted to all the relevant national regulatory authorities concerned, accompanied by the following:  (a) up-to-date project-specific cost-benefit analysis consistent with the central scenario referred to in Article 11 and any sensitivit i es referred to in Article 11, and the methodology for a harmonised energy system-wide cost-benefit analysis referred to in Article 14 and taking into account benefits beyond the borders of the Member States on the territory of which the project is located ;  (b) a business plan evaluating the financial viability of the project, including the chosen financing solution, and, for a project of common interest falling under the energy infrastructure category referred to in point (3) of Annex II, the results of market testing;  (c) where the project promoters agree, a substantiated proposal for a cross-border cost allocation.  Where a project is promoted by several project promoters, they shall submit their investment request jointly.  The relevant national regulatory authorities shall, upon receipt, transmit to the Agency, without delay, a copy of each investment request, for information purposes.  The relevant national regulatory authorities and the Agency shall preserve the confidentiality of commercially sensitive information.  5. Within six months of the date on which the investment request is received by the last of the relevant national regulatory authorities, those authorities shall, after consulting the project promoters concerned, take joint coordinated decisions on the allocation of efficiently incurred investment costs to be borne by each system operator for the project, as well as their inclusion in tariffs, or on the rejection of the investment request, in whole or in part, if the common analysis of the relevant national regulatory authorities concludes that the project or a part of it fails to provide a significant net benefit in any of the Member States of the relevant national regulatory authorities.  The relevant national regulatory authorities shall include the relevant efficiently incurred investment costs in tariffs, as defined in the recommendation referred to in paragraph 14, in accordance with the allocation of investment costs to be borne by each system operator for the project.  For projects in the territories of their respective Member State, the relevant national regulatory authorities shall thereafter assess, where appropriate, whether any affordability issues might arise due to the inclusion of the investment costs in tariffs.  6. In allocating the costs, the relevant national regulatory authorities shall take into account the following :  (a) actual or estimated congestion rents or other charges;  (b) actual or estimated revenues stemming from the inter-transmission system operator compensation mechanism established under Article 49 of Regulation (EU) 2019/943.  The allocation of costs across borders shall take into account, the economic, social and environmental costs and benefits of the projects in the Member States concerned and the need to ensure a stable financing framework for the development of projects of common interest while minimising the need for financial support. In allocating costs across borders, the relevant national regulatory authorities, after consulting the TSOs concerned, shall seek a mutual agreement based on, but not limited to, the information specified in paragraph 4, first subparagraph, points (a) and (b), of this Article. Their assessment shall be based on the central scenario and any sensitivities referred to in Article 11, allowing a robust analysis of the contribution of the project of common interest to the Union energy policy of decarbonisation, market integration, competition, sustainability and security of supply.  7. In allocating the costs, t he relevant national regulatory authorities shall apply the following general principles:  (a) w here at least 10 % of the estimated benefits of a project occur in a Member State, that Member State and the relevant national regulatory authority shall take part in the cross-border cost - allocation process ;  (b) w here appropriate, the allocation of costs among the Member States shall be based on the distribution of net benefits, ensuring that the cost-allocation key reflects that distribution ;  (c) t he cross-border cost allocation shall be based on an ex-ante cost-allocation agreement designed to ensure investment certainty , whereas t he agreement shall be transparent and predictable and t he cross-border cost-allocation may provide for the possibility of ex-post adjustments, provided that such adjustments are explicitly defined in the cost allocation decision and clearly framed, including as regards timeframes and categories of costs covered.  Where a project of common interest mitigates negative externalities, such as loop flows, and that project of common interest is implemented in the Member State at the origin of the negative externality, such mitigation shall not be regarded as a cross-border benefit and shall therefore not constitute a basis for allocating costs to the TSO of the Member States affected by those negative externalities.  8. The relevant national regulatory authorities shall, on the basis of the cross-border cost allocation referred to in paragraph 5 of this Article, take into account actual costs incurred by a TSO, HNO or other project promoter as a result of the investments when fixing or approving tariffs in accordance with Article 78(1) of Directive (EU) 2024 / 1788 and Article 59(1), point (a), of Directive (EU) 2019/944, insofar as those costs correspond to those of an efficient and structurally comparable operator.  9. The relevant national regulatory authorities shall notify the cost allocation decision to the Agency, without delay, together with all the relevant information with respect to that decision. In particular, the cost allocation decision shall set out detailed reasons for the allocation of costs among Member States, including the following:  (a) an evaluation of the identified impact on each of the concerned Member States, including those concerning network tariffs;  (b) an evaluation of the business plan referred to in paragraph 4, first subparagraph, point (b);  (c) regional or Union-wide positive externalities, such as security of supply, system flexibility, solidarity or innovation, which the project would generate;  (d) the result of the consultation of the project promoters concerned.  The cost allocation decision shall be published on the websites of the relevant national regulatory authorities and shared with Agency and the Commission.  By [ within 6 months of entry into force ], the Agency shall establish a central repository of all cross-border cost-allocation decisions taken by national regulatory authorities and host it on its website.  10. Where the relevant national regulatory authorities have not reached an agreement on the investment request within six months of the date on which the request was received by the last of the relevant national regulatory authorities, they shall inform the Agency without delay.  In that case, or upon a joint request from the relevant national regulatory authorities, the decision on the investment request including cross-border cost allocation referred to in paragraph 5 shall be taken by the Agency within three months of the date of referral to the Agency.  Before taking such a decision, the Agency shall consult the relevant national regulatory authorities and the project promoters. The three-month period referred to in the second subparagraph may be extended by an additional period of two months where further information is sought by the Agency. That additional period shall begin on the day following receipt of the complete information.  The assessment of the Agency shall be based on the central scenario established under Article 11 and any sensitivities, allowing a robust analysis of the contribution of the project of common interest to the Union energy policy targets of decarbonisation, market integration, competition, sustainability and security of supply.  The Agency, in its decision on the investment request including cross-border cost allocation, shall leave the determination of the way the investment costs are included in the tariffs in accordance with the cross-border cost allocation prescribed, to the relevant national authorities at the time of the implementation of that decision in accordance with national law.  The decision on the investment request including cross-border cost allocation shall be published. Article 25(3) and Articles 28 and 29 of Regulation (EU) 2019/942 shall apply.  11. A copy of all cost allocation decisions, together with all the relevant information with respect to each decision, shall be notified, without delay, by the Agency to the Commission. The Agency shall publish non-confidential versions of all decisions on its website. That information may be submitted in aggregate form. The Agency and the Commission shall preserve the confidentiality of commercially sensitive information.  12. Cost allocation decisions shall not affect the right of TSOs to apply and of national regulatory authorities to approve charges for access to networks in accordance with Regulation s (EU) 2019/943 and (E U ) 2024/1789 and Directive s (EU) 2019/944 and (EU) 2024/ 1 788 .  13. This Article shall not apply to projects of common interest which benefit from one or more of the following :  (a) a n exemption from Articles 31, 32, 33 and Article s 78(7) and Directive (EU) 2024/1788 , pursuant to Article 78 of Regulation (EU) 2024/1789 ;  (b) a n exemption from Article 19(2) and (3) of Regulation (EU) 2019/943 or Article 6, Article 59(7) and Article 60(1) of Directive (EU) 2019/944, pursuant to Article 63 of Regulation (EU) 2019/943;  (c) a derogation from unbundling or third - party access rules, pursuant to Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 714/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council 67 or to Article 64 of Regulation (EU) 2019/943 and Article 66 of Directive (EU) 2019/944.  14. By [ six months after entry into force of this Regulation ], the Agency shall adopt a recommendation for identifying good practices for the treatment of investment requests for projects of common interest in accordance with the principles referred to in paragraph 7 of this A rticle.  That recommendation shall be regularly updated by the Agency as necessary. It shall take account of sectorial specificities, and shall ensure consistency with the principles on the offshore grids for renewable energy cross-border cost sharing as referred to in Article 16(1). In adopting or updating the recommendation, the Agency shall carry out an extensive consultation process, involving all relevant stakeholders. That recommendation shall also include a non-binding cross-border cost-allocation template to facilitate the work of national regulatory agencies.  15. Projects of mutual interest shall obtain a cross-border cost allocation under the same rules and conditions referred to in this Article as regards the benefits they bring for the Union . It shall be issued in a coordinated manner by the relevant national regulatory authoriti es of the benefiting Member States.  16. This Article shall apply mutatis mutandis to project bundles under Article 18.  Article 18  Enabling energy infrastructure projects bundling for the purpose of cost-sharing  1. Project promoters may bundle two or more projects on the Union list to facilitate the discussions on cost - sharing between the relevant Member States and third countries, as appropriate, and the cross-border cost-allocation decisions between the concerned competent authorities of the Member States or between the competent authorities of the Member States and third countries, as appropriate.  2.

Title of the proposal/initiative  Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on guidelines for trans-European energy infrastructure amending Regulations (EU) 2019/942, and (EU) 2019/943 and (EU) 2024/1789 and repealing Regulation (EU) 2022/869.  1.2. Policy area(s) concerned  Area: Energy  Activity: Clean Industrial Deal  1.3. Objective(s)  1.3.1. General objective(s)  The general objective is the timely an efficient development and interoperability of resilient energy infrastructure, renewable energy and flexibility, including storage and recharging stations, across the EU. This will enable the EU to deliver on its energy and climate objectives, including ensuring energy affordability through better interconnectivity, leading to price convergence, reduced wholesale electricity prices and lower volatility of electricity prices as well as to accelerated connection of generation and demand.  1.3.2. Specific objective(s)  To achieve the general objective, four specific objectives (SOs) are addressed by this initiative:  i)  SO1: Ensure that projects included in network development plans and selected as PCI/PMIs address appropriately and effectively identified infrastructure needs ensuring timely and efficient development of energy infrastructure;  ii) SO2: Facilitate the use of cost-sharing tools for faster deployment of cross-border infrastructure projects, leading to an increased use of cost-sharing tools and a reduction in project deployment time;  iii) SO3: Shorten and simplify permitting procedures for energy infrastructure, renewable energy and storage projects, as well as recharging stations, leading to shorter time to obtain necessary permits, making it feasible to meet the existing deadlines, and simplified permit requirements;  iv)  SO4: Enhance physical and cyber security and resilience of cross-border energy infrastructure (PCIs/PMIs) by increasing the number of protection and resilience equipment and installations on critical network elements.  The proposal entails a new requirement for the Commission, which is linked to the achievement of SO1:  – Requirement 1 (linked to SO1): The Commission is tasked with the development of a comprehensive central scenario and sensitivity analyses, as necessary, at least every four years for the electricity, hydrogen and gas sectors to be used for the Union-wide ten year network development plans (TYNDP) (Article 11).  The proposal entails new requirements for ACER, which are linked to the achievement of SO1 and SO2:  – Requirement 2 (linked to SO1): For the purpose of the central scenario development, ACER is tasked with supporting as well as verifying the data collection by the Commission (Article 11). In addition, ACER is required to develop and publish a binding framework methodology for the identification of infrastructure needs (to be conducted by ENTSO-E and ENNOH).  – Requirement 3 (linked to SO2): ACER is mandated to update its Cross-Border Cost Allocation (CBCA) recommendation and establish a central repository of all CBCA decisions (Article 17).  1.3.3. Expected result(s) and impact  Specify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries / groups targeted.  The additional resources will allow the Commission and ACER to carry out the tasks necessary to fulfil their mandate under EU legislation as per the requirements under this proposal. The proposal is expected to have the following effects on the beneficiaries and groups targeted:  – Requirement 1: Tasking the Commission with central scenario development is expected to ensure greater transparency, scrutiny and coherence of inputs used in network planning both at European and national level, with the ultimate aim to ensure infrastructure needs are identified and addressed more effectively, leading to a reduction in the gap between planned infrastructure projects in the TYNDP and the identified cross-border infrastructure needs over time, to the benefit of all system and network operators and users by progressing faster towards an optimal grid.  – Requirement 2: Entrusting ACER with tasks related to the central scenario development and infrastructure needs identification will ensure the process and its outcomes are robust and credible, with similar benefits as Requirement 1.  – Requirement 3: Tasking ACER with updating its Cross-Border Cost Allocation Recommendation will create a more harmonised cost-sharing framework improving consistency across Member States and CBCA decisions and encourage greater involvement of non-hosting Member States, with the aim to facilitate the use of cost-sharing tools for faster deployment of cross-border infrastructure projects.  1.3.4. Indicators of performance  Specify the indicators for monitoring progress and achievements.  The indicators for monitoring progress and achievement of the initiative’s objectives are listed in Annex 8 of the Impact Assessment accompanying the Grids Package. They include in particular:  – the extent to which projects included in network developments and selected as PCIs/PMIs address appropriately and effectively identified infrastructure needs;  – the effective and increased use of cost-sharing tools;  – the simplification of permitting procedures, shortening of permitting lead times and meeting current deadlines;  – the enhanced physical and cyber security and resilience of energy infrastructure.  As regards the specific objectives which Requirements 1-3 are linked with, the following indicators apply:  – Indicators for Requirement 1 & 2 (linked to SO1): The number and total capacity of new cross-border interconnectors approved/implemented; the extent to which identified infrastructure needs are addressed by infrastructure projects (capacity) included in the TYNDP (planned, under construction or commissioned) or other non-wire solutions (presence of the gap between needs and projects, and decrease of the gap); the uptake of non-wire solutions in terms of number of projects and respective increase in grid capacity.  – Indicators for Requirement 3 (linked to SO2): The number of binding cost-sharing agreements enabling the implementation cross-border projects; the average duration for reaching a cost-allocation agreement; the number of non-hosting countries contributing to cost-sharing agreements; the number of projects being as part of bundles being submitted for PCI/PMI status  1.4. The proposal/initiative relates to:   a new action   a new action following a pilot project / preparatory action 70  X the extension of an existing action   a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action  1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative  1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative  Requirement 1:  A new provision is introduced requiring the Commission to develop a central scenario to be used for the Union-wide TYNDP after entry into force of the Regulation and at least every four years thereafter (Article 11). The Commission must also develop a methodology for the collection of data from the ENTSO-E, ENNOH and ENTSO-G and consult the relevant actors on the data collected. The Commission must also consult the draft central scenario with the TEN-E Group and adopt and publish the final central scenario. The Commission may also develop sensitivity analyses to the central scenario if necessary based on market of policy developments. The Commission will have to follow up on the identified needs in the relevant regional fora. Within the Commission, these tasks would be attributed to DG Energy and the JRC.  As regards DG Energy, the new requirement related to the central scenario development, would necessitate additional resources to manage the scenario development process which implies a large number of interactions with stakeholders, Member States, supporting services and partners etc. On the basis of the impact assessment accompanying this proposal, the execution of these tasks will result in an additional workload for DG Energy totalling 6 FTEs. These additional resources would cover the following needs:  Process steering:  – Coordinate the overall process between ENTSO/TSOs, the Commission and ACER as required by the TEN-E legislation; Consult with stakeholders and Member States during the different phases of the process (including hrough workshopes and meeetings) and appropriate follow-up (as described in Articles 11 to 13).  – Ensure the compatibility of grid scenarios within the overall policy architecture; Align the scenario design with ongoing policy scenario (e.g. related to 2040 targets, RED, EE, ETS, etc); Ensure alignment with NECPs and ERAA; Manage the assessment process of the draft and final infrastructure needs identification report (carried out by the ENTSOs).  – Coordinate the needs matching process (following the adoption of the infrastructure needs assessment) with ENTSO-E, TSOs, Member States, national regulatory authorities and relevant stakeholders and steer the process with the relevant regional groups. Closely follow the energy system wide cost-benefit analysis with ENTSOs and ensure propoer implementation including the inclusions of relevant stakeholders.  – Prepare and draft legal acts and manage the adoption process.  Scenario development and coordination:  – Ensure data collection with Member States, ENTSO-E, ENTSO-G, ENNOH, NRAs, and other stakeholders. Maintain repositories and ensure data quality process.  – Coordination of the assessment work. This will include all steps of the modelling process, i.e. ensuring data availability, setting critical assumptions, reviewing and quality controlling draft modelling results, following up on work plan and planning the interaction of modellers/analysts with relevant stakeholders.  – Document the different steps of the modelling exercise and disseminate the reports and data sets. The documentation will include methodology, data, key assumptions, results in different formats: reports, data files, online resources.  As regards the JRC , they would be tasked with supporting DG Energy in the central scenario development as well as executing the modelling. Data collection from Member States and TSOs for electricity, gas and hydrogen modelling will be the responsibility of DG ENER with support from the JRC. On the basis of the impact assessment this is expected to result in new workload for JRC totalling 12 FTEs.  – Working with DG Energy and providing technical and policy expertise in developing the methodology for the central scenario modelling as well as supporting DG Energy with the necessary data collection from the ENTSO-E, ENNOH and ENTSO-G.  – Energy system modelling: Construct scenarios and sensitivities; Data management required for the energy system modelling;  – Electricity modelling: Electricity dispatch modelling of the scenarios; Power flow calculations; Data management required for the electricity modelling  – Gas and hydrogen modelling: Updating the long-term expectations for gas and hydrogen; Gas market and network modelling of the scenarios; Modelling of gas/hydrogen flows; Data modelling included for gas/hydrogen modelling; Data management required for gas and hydrogen modelling.  Overall, it is estimated that the proposal will result in new workload for the Commission totalling 18 FTEs for (6 FTEs for DG Energy and 12 FTEs for JRC, of which 4 redeployed from its current resources and 9 financed via an administrative agreementI). In addition, EUR 1 million in one-off operational costs and 500,000 in recurrent, annual operational costs would be required for technical updates, extensions and maintenance of the electricity, gas and hydrogen models, for modelling of targets, NECPs and energy mixes, as well as organisation of workshops and missions.  ACER  Requirement 2:  ACER is tasked with supporting as well as verifying the all input data collected by the Commission as part of the central scenario development (Article 11). In addition, ACER is required to develop a binding methodology for the identification of infrastructure needs (Article 12) and assess the compliance of the draft infrastructure needs identification developed and submitted by ENTSO-E and ENNOH, with the developed framework methodology and report to the TEN-E Group. ACER is also required to update the framework methodology when necessary on its own initiative or upon the request of the Commission  The execution of these new tasks is estimated to result in an additional workload for ACER totalling 2 FTE. In addition, ACER would have operational expenditures including consultancy support for the development of the infrastructure needs methodology, the development of an IT tool to facilitate data verification and overheads, with estimated one-off cost of EUR 130 000 as well as recurrent operational costs of EUR 100 000 per year.  Requirement 3:  ACER is required to adopt a Cross-Border Cost Allocation Recommendation, identifying good practices for the treatment of investment requests for PCIs, taking into account the principles in the TEN-E Regulation (Article 17). That recommendation shall be regularly updated as necessary. In adopting or amending the recommendation, ACER shall carry out an extensive consultation process, involving all relevant stakeholders. That recommendation shall also include a non-binding cross-border cost-allocation template to facilitate the work of national regulatory agencies.  The development and adoption of a Cross-Border Cost Allocation Recommendation a\s well as the maintenance of a repository of CBCA Decisions is estimated to result in an additional workload for ACER totalling 1 FTE as well as an estimated one-off cost of EUR 70 000 for the development of the IT tool for the repository of CBCA decisions.  For DG Energy and, JRC and ACER, the requirements above to implementation of the legislative proposal extend beyond the current 2021-2027 MFF.  1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, great er effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this section 'added value of EU involvement' is the value resulting from EU action that is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.  Please see Explanatory Memorandum sections on subsidiarity and proportionality.  1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past  The evaluation of the previous TEN-E Regulation showed that it effectively improved integration of Member States’ networks, stimulated energy trade and hence contributed to Union competitiveness. PCIs have also strongly contributed to security of supply as a main contextual driver to the design of the TEN-E Regulation. Following its evaluation in 2020, the TEN-E Regulation was revised in 2022. The Implementation Report annexed to the Impact Assessment analyses lessons learned from the implementation of the revised TEN-E Regulation. The Implementation Report provides evidence of the need for further improvements, namely when it comes to scenario development, infrastructure needs identification and consequent TYNDP, PCI/PMI project selection and assessment, as well as CBCA and permitting frameworks.  1.5.4. Compatibility with the multiannual financial framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments  This Grids Package is a key deliverable under the Clean Industrial Deal and the Action Plan for Affordable Energy, which are part of the 2025 Commission Work Program. The proposal is complementary to other initiatives that aim to create a more integrated European energy market and lower energy costs for households and industries. Energy infrastructure is also crucial to achieve the proposed 2040 EU climate target, and to the EU’s objective of achieving climate neutrality by 2050.  The Commission proposal for the new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) 2028-2034 highlights “the vital importance of a genuine Energy Union and well-integrated EU infrastructure networks”, which is reflected in a substantially increased budget proposed for the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) for Energy. The TEN-E Regulation provides the basis for energy infrastructure projects funded under CEF.  1.5.5. Assessment of the different available financing options, including scope for redeployment  The Impact Assessment report acompanying this proposal analysed different policy options to achieve the initiative’s general and specific objectives. The preferred policy option which is pursued through this legislative proposal, was considered the most effective and cost-efficient approach and in line with the subsidiarity and proportionality principles.  DG Energy, JRC and ACER are considered best placed to execute the additional requirements stemming from the legislative proposal due to their previous experiences with the infrastructure planning process and energy system modelling.  DG Energy has developed significant experience in the infrastructure planning and coordination process since the TEN-E Regulation was first adopted in 2013. It is therefore best suited to coordinate the infrastructure needs identification and gap filling mechanisms at EU-level in an impartiall manner. The JRC has significant technical knowledge in energy system modelling and has developed its own modelling tools. It is therefore considered best placed to conduct the modelling tasks linked to the central scenario development.  Due to its mandate, ACER is best placed to implement requirements 1 & 2. It has developed substantial technical expertise as a key actor with a formal role in both the infrastructure planning process and the cross-border cost allocation framework at EU-level under the current TEN-E framework  The additional FTEs are needed for new tasks/requirements ensuing from this legisltive proposal, while existing tasks will not decrease in the foreseeable future.  1.6.

Comments  N.A.  2. MANAGEMENT MEASURES  2.1. Monitoring and reporting rules  DG Energy and the JRC  The tasks directly implemented by DG Energy will follow the annual cycle of planning and monitoring, as implemented in the Commission and the executive agencies, including reporting the results through the Annual Activity Report of DG ENER and the Annual Activity Report of the JRC.  ACER  According to its financial regulation, ACER has to provide, in the context of its Programming Document, an annual Work Programme including details on resources, both financial and human, per each of the activities carried out.  ACER reports monthly to DG Energy on budget execution, including commitments, and payments by budget title, and vacancy rates by type of staff.  In addition, DG Energy is directly represented in the governance bodies of ACER. Through its representatives in the Administrative Board, DG Energy will be informed of the use of the budget and the establishment plan at each of its meetings during the year.  Finally, also in line with financial rules, ACER is subject to annual requirements for reporting on activities and the use of resources through the Administrative Board and its Annual Activity Report.  2.2. Management and control system(s)  2.2.1. Justification of the budget implementation method(s), the funding implementation mechanism(s), the payment modalities and the control strategy proposed  Requirement 1:  The tasks under Requirement will be assigned to the Commission.  Subject to decision taken during the implementation, these tasks may be carried out internally or outsourced to a service provider, via a public procurement procedure. In the case the tasks are procured from a service provider, the procurement will be implemented under direct management, in full application of the provisions of the Financial Regulation. The control strategy for procurements in DG Energy and the JRC includes specific ex-ante legal, operational and financial controls on the procurement procedure (review by the advisory committee for procurement and contracts) as well as on the signature of contracts. In addition, expenditure made to procure goods and services is subject to ex ante and, when necessary, ex-post and financial controls.  Requirements 2 & 3:  Due to its mandate, ACER is best placed to establish expertise related to the implementation of requirements 4 and 3.  DG Energy established a control strategy for managing its relations with ACER, part of the 2017 Internal Control Framework of the Commission. The Agency revised and adopted its own Internal Control Framework in December 2018.  2.2.2. Information concerning the risks identified and the internal control system(s) set up to mitigate them  DG Energy  The elements directly managed by DG Energy may be subject to the usual risks affecting public procurement procedures. These risks are considered low level as regards legality and regularity of the expenditure. Appropriate and effective controls are in place at corporate and DG level.  Concerning performance, the main risk are wrong estimates as regards the workload created by this proposal, given that it introduces new tasks. This risk needs to be accepted, since, as experience has shown, if additional resources needs are not included in the initial proposal, it is very difficult to remedy this situation later on.  DG JRC  As part of the risk assessment process for its scientific activities, the JRC identifies potential risks, evaluates their level and plans necessary mitigating actions and identifies existing controls. The key risk identified refers to a) the estimation of the related workload for the new tasks associated to this proposal (the workload for some of the tasks might be underestimated); b) insufficient quantity or quality of the data to support the various new tasks. For a) the risk needs to be accepted; mitigation measures include careful staff planning throughout the duration of the activities to ensure appropriate expertise. For b) the actions include an early participation in designing and framing the data collection processes, as well as early identification, within each task requiring data intense activities, of the potential barriers to get access to the data of interest and early communication with DG ENER and relevant stakeholders to raise the issue of data availability.  ACER  As regards new tasks for ACER, the proposal includes several new tasks which mitigates this risk, since while the workload of some future tasks may be underestimated, others may be overestimated, providing scope for possible future redeployment.  2.2.3. Estimation and justification of the cost-effectiveness of the controls (ratio between the control costs  and the value of the related funds managed), and assessment of the expected levels of risk of error (at payment & at closure)  DG Energy  The tasks assigned for DG Energy will be implemented following already existing control system and the cost of control ratio is expected to remain stable (5 to 6% of the funds managed based on recent exercises).  ACER  The allocation of additional tasks for the existing mandate of ACER is not expected to generate specific additional controls at Agency level, therefore, the ratio of control costs over value of funds managed will remain unaltered for ACER.  2.3. Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities  DG Energy  DG Energy adopted a revised Anti-fraud Strategy in 2020 and, in 2023, a revised action plan covering the years 2023-2025. DG Energy is is currently revising its AFS for the years 2026-2028, in accordance with the OLAF methodology. The Energy AFS  are based on the Commission Antifraud Strategy and on a specific risk assessment carried out internally to identify the areas most vulnerable to fraud, the controls already in place and the actions necessary to improve DG Energy’s capacity to prevent, detect and correct fraud.  DG JRC  The JRC Anti-Fraud Strategy, along with its accompanying Action Plan, was adopted in 2020 and modified in 2024 to revise and update the plan for the period 2025-2027. The updated plan includes three new actions: an awareness-raising campaign focusing on Commission ethics issues and anti-fraud measures, with relevant examples tailored for JRC scientific staff, launched in the first half of 2025; an expanded training programme featuring thematic sessions on topics such as conflict of interest, authorship, the use of AI, whistleblowing and reporting channels, among others; updated Sharepoint pages dedicated to ethics issues and anti-fraud measures. These new actions complement the ongoing efforts from the 2021-2024 Action Plan and JRC participation in the Commission Antifraud Strategy Action Plan. The JRC values its cooperation with OLAF, the internal control team, and other stakeholders in our collective efforts to combat fraud.  ACER  ACER applies the anti-fraud principles of decentralised EU Agencies, in line with the Commission approach and the Guidelines by OLAF of 2024 for decentralised agencies and JUs. In December 2024 the Agency adopted a new Anti-Fraud Strategy, repealing Decision 15/2021 of the Administrative Board of the Agency. The new strategy, spanning the period 2025-2027, is based on the following strategic objectives: optimise existing fraud prevention measures, enhance timeliness and accuracy of existing detection systems, strengthen investigation protocols, and optimise corrective actions for swift recoveries.  3.

Digital dimensions  4.1. Requirements of digital relevance  Table: Row 1 — Requirements of digital relevance in the proposal: Requirement 1 (R1) relates to scenario development processes and infrastructure needs identification, which should consider the potential use of digital and smart solutions next to physical grid development already in the modelling part of the network development planning. As a related requirement, transmission system operators in electricity are required to consider with priority non-wire and digital solutions when proposing new infrastructure projects, with such requirements applicable on a European level (as part of the EU-wide ten-years network development plan) as well as on a national level (national network development plans on a transmission level). This will help ensuring  maximum efficiency in grid development and also incentivise use of digital solutions in practice. This requirement applies for EU institutions responsible for the modelling process, Member States, bodies representing transmission system operators on a European level (ENTSO for Electricity, ENTSO for Gas and ENNOH) as well as to transmission system operators on a national level. Requirement 2 (R2) relates to introduction of a new non-wire and digital transmission category for Projects of Common Interest. Such category aims to provide better incentives for use of grid enhancing and digital technologies by transmission system operators, to increase efficiency of grid utilisation and increase cross-border transmission capacity. When applying for the new category, transmission system operators are required to submit data related to technical characteristics of proposed digitalisation systems as well as expected impacts on the transmission system operation. ENTSO for Electricity, as a body proposed for calculating the costs and benefits of new projects, would be responsible for processing related data. Requirement 3 (R3) relates to the permitting application procedure for projects on the Union list of projects of common interest and of projects of mutual interest. Member States’ national competent authority must be able to receive permitting applications and all relevant documents in digital format (Article 8). Under the proposal, Member States are required to ensure a digital platform is available at national level to manage steps of the permit of the permit-granting procedure (including permitting applications, permitting processes, ongoing permitting decisions) and make available decisions issued in an easily accessible format (Article 10 (4)).  This should contribute to more uniform digitalisation and transparency across different permitting authorities in Member States and ultimately speed up permitting. This will be on top of the obligation on MS that all decisions are to be issued in an easily accessible format.  4.2. Data  Table: Row 1 — For Requirement 1: The requirement relates to existing data collection for purposes of grid modelling and scenario development and may lead to new data being collected on future use of digital technologies and their potential. While assumptions on potential of such technologies exist in literature, Member States’ data are currently not publicly available and are not collected for the same purpose (once-only principle has been duly followed). Transmission system operators will start assessing flexibility needs assessment pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2019/943 as of 2026 and some of the data being used can also be used for purposes of grid planning. However, the span of the former is only 10 years, while Union-wide grid planning covers upcoming 10-20 years. In this regard, data collection seems inevitable to ensure full coverage. Secondary legislation on concrete format of data will ensure existing collections for the purposes of Flexibility Needs Assessments are taken into account to avoid any duplication in requirements. Regarding the data flow, data are provided by transmission system operators, regulatory authorities and Member States to the Commission based on rule to be adopted via secondary legal acts. Additional data for grid modelling, if necessary, are to be provided by transmission system operators directly to the ENTSO for electricity. For Requirement 2: Data related to submission of application for the Project of Common Interest are unique for each project and hence must be collected at time of submission of the application (once-only principle hence fully complied to). Such data relate to scope of the project, financial estimates, technologies used, location, impact on environment and power grid, etc. Data will be submitted by project promoters (mostly transmission system operators) to the ENTSO for Electricity and the European Commission for the purpose of assessing costs and benefits under the evaluation processes for Projects of Common Interest. For Requirement 3: The digital platforms which Member States would be required to set up would store all data necessary for a complete permit or permits for projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest. These are personal data with connection to the applicant whether a natural or legal person, the characteristics of the project and all necessary supporting documents.  4.3. Digital solutions  Table: Row 1 — For Requirement 1: Platform related to requirement 1 relates to grid modelling and scenario modelling for future infrastructure development. ENTSO for Electricity already uses such platform, hence new requirement relates to upgrade of the platform to process more data. Regarding European Commission role in the scenario modelling process, data will be used in existing models, hence no new requirements to establish a separate platform are stipulated by changes. For Requirement 2: This requirement should not lead to establishment of new platforms of systems for processing the data, as the PCI selection process is well established and the aim is to broaden the scope of categories (while keeping the principles for the assessment, using existing systems for processing applications and calculating costs and benefits). For Requirement 3: The digitalisation and centralisation of permitting procedures will be facilitated by the digital platforms which Member States would be required to set up. By centralising this data, we expect to simplify procedures and prevent the duplication of the same data in different platforms. In the recitals, the Commission urges that the portal should present features, including by means of artificial intelligence, allowing the single contact point, other authorities and applicants to check the status of the application and where delays are, as well as check compliance with the permitting deadlines. In addition, it should allow for the extraction of statistics to check the overall progress of permitting-granting procedures in Member States. The portal should facilitate the duties of the single contact point who should have access to all relevant data and information.  4.4. Interoperability assessment  Table: Row 1 — Requirements 1 and 2 do not require interaction across Member State borders as the aim is to feed data for evaluations at the EU level, in a centralized way. They are also not related to cross-border interoperability as the data exchanged are on future estimates of project development, not on existing data flows related to operation of the system (which are already exchanged via other TSO cooperation platforms). There is an expectation that data will be shared only once, i.e. either to the ENTSO for Electricity (which will consequently share them with the Commission), or with the Commission directly (in case identical data are not needed by the ENTSO for Electricity). Information is exchanged via data files – not via mutual linking of two platforms. Requirement 3 does not require interaction across Member State borders, among EU entities or between EU entities and public sector bodies. It also does not have an effect on cross-border inter-operability as the data is of relevance for national, rather than EU-level decision-making procedures. A centrally defined data structure has been considered and discarded, since due to the mostly national character of the biggest percentage of the permitting procedures in each MS and the different permitting systems, it is logical that the actual decision on format for the implementation is left to MS, which can decide what fits best to their system and the new digital platform they will set up. While TEN-E Regulation requires national competent authorities in charge of permitting to cooperate in cross border projects to the extent possible, it gives Member States the freedom to decide on the most appropriate way to do so. Since part of the data in question may also be required and assessed for procedures related with projects not covered unde TEN-E regulation, it will also be proposed that these platforms are set up as multi-purpose platform that covers the permitting of a wide range of energy asets (grids,pipelines, renewables, storage, etc). The public services affected by these suggestions would be all national authorities involved in the permitting of energy assets, e.g. energy ministry and/or agencies, municipal/local administration and environmental authorities. Administrative bodies or entities responsible for opinion or approval on projects afecting spatiall planning and cultural heritage sites would also be affected.  4.5. Measures to support digital implementation  Table: Row 1 — Measures relate to Requirement 2, i.e. introduction of a new non-wire and digital transmission category for Projects of Common Interest. Such category aims to provide better incentives for use of grid enhancing and digital technologies by transmission system operators, to increase efficiency of grid utilisation and increase cross-border transmission capacity. Such investment, if granted a status of a Project of Common Interest, would benefit from accelerated permitting and if fulfilling all necessary conditions, may apply for a funding from Connecting Europe Facility.

The proposal emphasizes the development and integration of energy infrastructure through electrification and hydrogen systems, while also streamlining planning and permitting processes for cross-border energy projects to enhance network efficiency and resilience. This addresses challenges such as lengthy project completion times and permitting bottlenecks.

To ensure timely development, the proposal introduces measures to bolster both physical and cyber security, responding to recent incidents and the growing interest of third-country actors in EU energy infrastructure. Projects of common and mutual interest are selected for inclusion in the Union list through a unified process based on transparent and objective criteria aligned with EU energy policy objectives. These projects must be part of the latest Union-wide ten-year network development plan, with sustainability as a key criterion.

Specific criteria for these projects include contributions to sustainability through renewable energy integration, market integration, security of supply, network security, smart sector integration, and carbon dioxide emission reduction. For electricity transmission, distribution, and storage projects, contributions to sustainability, market integration, and security of supply are emphasized. Smart electricity grid projects must contribute to security of supply, market integration, network security, and smart sector integration. Carbon dioxide transport and storage projects should focus on sustainability and avoiding emissions.

The proposal outlines several priority corridors and thematic areas for development, including offshore electricity grid developments. It also emphasizes",
