CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  This proposal provides for a date of application as of 1 January 2028 and is presented for a Union of Member States.  · Reasons and objectives  The Single Market and Customs Programme is part of the post-2027 Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) package and aims to consolidate four individual funding programmes of the current MFF in a new programme to support activities in different policy areas) that  contribute to the smooth functioning of the Single Market, Customs Union, Taxation and Anti-Fraud. The programme will also cover the development, production and dissemination of European statistics, as it is defined in the Regulation (EC) 223/2009.  This programme has the potential to produce synergies with cross-cutting impacts covering several policy areas. It also aims to simplify access to funding for applicants and reduce the overall administrative burden. As a result of  the flexibility, the programme enhances the adaptability and responsiveness to unforeseen needs and should achieve its general and specific objectives more effectively than its predecessors, while ensuring coherence between all its components, ultimately producing greater EU value added.  The Single Market is governed by the fundamental principles of free movement of goods, services, people, and capital and has been a major contributor to growth, competitiveness, and employment. A well-functioning and safe-guarded Single Market is a pre-requisite for a competitive European economy . It has been key to bring ing prosperity , growth and solidarity , and supporting Europe’s resilience and preparedness against unforeseen challenges and crises such as the C OVID -19 pandemic. With a GDP of €18 trillion, the Single Market stands today as the world’s second-largest economy . 1  I n today’s uncertain world and volatile geopolitical challenges , t he importance of the S ingle M arket as our European home market of 450 million people and 26 million businesses is ever increasing . T he Political Guidelines for the 2024-2029 European Commission 2 and the recent reports by Enrico Letta and Mario Draghi stress the need to consolidate and exploit the potential of the S ingle M arket , including research and innovation drivers . 3 .  Moreover, t he Single Market Strategy 4 , the EU Startup and Scaleup Strategy 5 and the Savings and Investments Union Strategy 6 also set out a new approach to create a mor e simple, fair , seamless an d strong European home market with deep capital pools, simplifying regulations, stimulating reforms, removing barriers, including obstacles linked with differences among Member States legislation and administrative procedures, and promoting cross-border trade and investment to boost competitiveness and growth. A key additional condition for the success of the Single Market is an effective cohesion policy and harmonized legislation and administrative procedures.  EU tax policy is key to improving the functioning of the Single Market, its competitiveness and investments, including by avoiding distortions of competition through taxation. Digitalisation and modernisation of taxation are now key-factors to effectively implementing EU taxation policy, and supporting revenue collection for the EU and Member States’ budgets. Coordination on tax matters amongst Member States improve the fight against tax fraud, tax evasion and tax avoidance.  The Single Market is intrinsically linked with the continuously evolving EU Customs Union , which has been safeguarding the EU’s external borders since 1968. The Customs Union remains the foundation of the Union and a fundamental enabler and guardian of the Single Market and other EU political priorities, including contributing to Europe’s economic security strategy. It is key both for collecting duties for the Union budget and for ensuring external border and supply chain security, contributing to safety and security in the European Union.  To make the Customs Union work in practice, the Commission and the customs administrations of the Member States need to design and implement common solutions to common problems. Over the past decades, the responsibilities of Member States’ customs authorities have extended beyond their traditional role of supervising and facilitating EU trade and its economic interests to take on an increasing number of responsibilities in the field of safety and security in order to (i) protect the public against health, environment and civil security threats, and (ii) to  protect European businesses against unfair global competition from non-compliant goods. This broad mandate means the customs administrations are now effectively the lead authority for the control of goods entering the Single Market at the EU's external borders and underpin a highly performing Customs Union, capable of adjusting to challenges such as geopolitical uncertainties and to increasingly volatile international trade patterns.  The Schengen area is a strategic asset of the Union and a key enabler for the free movement of persons and labour mobility and for building resilience through coordinated responses to cross-border security challenges. By eliminating barriers to mobility, Schengen enhances cross-border business activity and plays an important role in advancing the Union’s strategic autonomy, reinforcing its capacity to remain resilient and interconnected in the face of global disruptions.  Safeguarding the Single Market and Customs Union from fraud and illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Union is key.  Article 325 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) establishes shared responsibility between, the Union and   the Member States for countering fraud, corruption and any other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Union. Protecting the financial interests of the Union should cover all aspects of the Union budget, on both the revenue and expenditure sides.  This Single Market and Customs Programme acts as an enabler for the infrastructure of the Single Market. It should encompass a regulatory and operational framework supporting competitiveness and growth covering policy areas such as market surveillance, standardisation, product conformity, consumer protection, intellectual property rights (IPR), public procurement, crisis management, financial services, competition policy, enforcement, implementing tools for administrative cooperation and access to information, and the production, development and dissemination of official European statistics.  In the aforementioned areas, EU level action is required to comply with legal obligations enshrined in the Treaties and secondary legislation. The Member States and the Commission share the responsibility for the correct implementation, application and enforcement of EU law. This includes ensuring compliance with Single Market rules, and respecting people’s and businesses’ rights. The Commission’s work on ensuring compliance in this area combines three main aspects: removing barriers within the Single Market, facilitating collaboration with Member States and facilitating collaboration between Member States; as well as corrective implementation, enforcement actions and stimulating reforms . Developing the tools to support action in these three areas is fundamental for ensuring and improving the functioning of the Single Market and Customs Union.  Furthermore, as part of the integration process for all enlargement countries towards fully functioning market economies, there is a need to support the approximation of legislation, to provide capacity building, including improving operational capacities and to provide targeted awareness raising.  Effectively implementing EU standards, policies and compliance with EU rules governing the Single Market and Customs Union, and cooperation between national authorities constitute challenges to be addressed, to support reforms, collaborative opportunities, human competency building and other initiatives. In particular, to reduce administrative burden on businesses and citizens, Single Market rules should be streamlined and simplified, where relevant, and be further underpinned by collaborative and innovative tools promoting a paperless Single Market.  Considering the interconnections and interactions between the respective policies outlined above, continuous funding must be ensured in the area of the Single Market and Customs Union, to support compliance with EU rules and cooperation among Member States.  The Single Market and Customs Programme addresses these policy needs by bringing together activities financed under four predecessor programmes in the area of (i) the Single Market (including market surveillance, product conformity, standardisation, consumer protection, competition policy, company law, contract law, intellectual property rights, crisis management, public procurement, financial services, and European statistics), (ii) customs, (iii) taxation and (iv) anti-fraud.  This programme integrates the following current programmes:  – parts 7 of the Single Market Programme (SMP) established by Regulation (EU) 2021/690 of the European Parliament and of the Council 8 ,  – t he Customs programme established by Regulation (EU) 2021/444 of the European Parliament and of the Council 9 ,  – the Customs Control Equipment Instrument established as part of the Integrated Border Management Fund by Regulation (EU) 2021/1077 of the European Parliament and of the Council 10 type interventions ,  – the Fiscalis programme established by Regulation (EU) 2021/847 of the European Parliament and of the Council 11 , and  – the Union Anti-Fraud P rogramme established by Regulation (EU) 2021/785 of the European Parliament and of the Council 12 .  Under the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) 2021-2027, the Single Market Programme offers funding opportunities, in line with the Union’s legal obligations, to deliver on a major policy priority of the Union namely the completion of the barrier-free Single Market. Its aim is to protect and empower citizens, consumers, investors and businesses, by enforcing Union law, facilitating market access (while ensuring a high level of consumer protection), and by enhancing cooperation between the competent authorities of Member States and between the competent authorities of Member States and the Commission and the decentralised Union agencies.  Another aim is to develop, produce and disseminate official European statistics that play a pivotal role in informing a wide range of EU policies including the objectives and functioning of the Single Market and the Union’s competitiveness. The European Statistical System is increasingly benefiting from new data sources and technologies that lead to more timely and relevant statistics in support of all EU political priorities. Reliable and comparable European statistics developed, produced and disseminated under the programme pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 are essential for evidence-based decision-making.  The EU Customs and Fiscalis programmes 2021-2027 accompany the customs and tax policies in the EU. Designed as cooperation programmes, both have a heavy digital component and face the same challenges mentioned above, including – on the customs policy side – ensuring adequate funding to secure the functioning of a well performing Customs Union and to address challenges in the digital age. The cross-border nature of infrastructure and services and the focus on system interoperability are evident both in the area of customs and taxation.  The Customs programme 2021-2027 supports the Customs Union and customs authorities working together and acting as one to:  – protect the financial and economic interests of the Union and its Member States,  – ensure security and safety within the Union , and  – p rotect the Union from unfair and illegal trade, while facilitating legitimate business activity.  Approximately 95% of its budget is dedicated to Commission procurement for central digital systems and solutions. The Customs programme also includes components for collaborative and human competency building activities that are at the disposal of all programme participating countries (Member States and candidate/potential candidate countries). These activities work to ensure EU customs authorities work together and act as one.  The Customs programme includes an objective of efficiency gains for EU customs policy and an increase in the agile use of data . 13 In this respect, the future programme will be the transition and implementation vector, aim ing to advanc e on creating efficiencies and moder n digital solutions f or the Customs Union 14 in a more centralised digital environment. Without central supply chain monitoring and control by customs, the EU does not have full visibility on which goods enter and leave its territory. This weakens not only the credibility of the EU sectoral policies, but also limits the EU ’s capacity as a geopolitical actor.  At present there are almost 70 central customs IT systems (developed and operated by the Commission) that form the backbone of the Customs Union. These must be maintained to ensure the uninterrupted operation of the Customs Union, in line with the EU’s legal obligations, up until their overhaul by the EU Customs Data Hub.  T he Customs Control Equipment Instrument (CCEI) , which is part of the Integrated Border Management Fund under the MFF 2021-2027 , shares the same general objective as the Customs programme . Funding under this instrument allows Member States to purchase, maint ain and upgrade of state-of-the-art customs equipment such as scanners, automated number plate recognition systems, sniffer dogs and mobile laboratories for sample analysis etc. Th e objective is to achieve adequate and equivalent results of customs c hecks , essential for the facilitation of legitimate trade, while ensuring sufficient level of protection at the external borders . The Customs R eform P roposal 15 has established the need for the future EU Customs Authority implementing the future CCEI - type interventions for the enlargement countries and addressing any crisis situations for the Member States.  The Fiscalis programme 2021-2027 support s the EU’s objectives for enhancing the functioning of the single market, for fostering the competitiveness of the Union and fair competition in the Union, for protecting the financial and economic interests of the Union and its Member States, including protecting those interests from tax fraud, tax evasion and tax avoidance, and for improving tax collection. In this context, t he programme supports the development, operation and modernisation of the key digital infrastructures for taxation 16 in line with the Commission’s legal obligations established by EU legislation . This represent s around 85% of the 2021-2027 programme’s budget, in the form of Commission procurement . The programme also supports project -based cooperation and human capacity building activities, to implement the EU tax policy objectives including enhancing the functioning of the Single Market . It also puts in place and operate s common tools to facilitate cooperation in the Single Market , particularly in relation to the fight against tax evasion and fraud. The massive rise of artificial intelligence, cryptocurrency, with yet unknown consequences calls for adjusting ambitions and needs for digitalising and updating existing digital systems and infrastructures. Changing tax policies also call for more and better digital solutions to complement the portfolio of the existing 30 established central tax IT systems funded by the programme in line with the established EU level legal obligation s .  The Union Anti-Fraud Programme (UAFP) 17 serves a dual and essential role: it helps the Commission fulfil its obligations under Article 325 TFEU to safeguard the Union budget against fraud, corruption, and other irregularities, while simultaneously supporting Member States in their efforts to uphold the same commitment.  The UAFP has three vital components, each strengthening the EU’s defence against financial wrongdoing.  (1) First, it funds anti-fraud activities across Member States and associated third countries . This in clud es funding investigative equipment and specialised anti-fraud training, aimed at empowering those on the front lines of fraud prevention.  (2) Second, it finances the Anti-Fraud Information System (AFIS), a secure IT platform that enables Member States and the Commission to safely store and exchange sensitive investigative information. This platform is grounded in the legal framework of Council Regulation (EU) No 515/97 18 , which ensures mutual administrative cooperation within the EU as well as with third countries .  (3) Third, it sets up the Irregularity Management System (IMS), which is a specialised part of the AFIS designed for reporting irregularities and suspected fraud to the Commission, in line with sector-specific legislation.  Both the AFIS and the IMS are essential pillars supporting the investigative mandate of OLAF and the Commission’s responsibilities. Their ongoing funding and development are therefore indispensable, ensuring the Union’s and Member States’ continued ability to detect, prevent, and address fraud at every level.  · Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  The importance of the Single Market considering the emerging political challenges is identified in the Political Guidelines and recent reports from Enrico Letta and Mario Draghi. The Political Guidelines 19 highlight the need to deepen the Single Market in general and to create a new momentum to complete the Single Market in sectors like services, energy, defence, finance, electronic communications and digital, research and innovation, and to tackle challenges linked with e-commerce in order to ensure consumers and businesses benefit from a level playing field based on effective customs and tax controls.  The Single Market and Customs programme is consistent with other existing and proposed Union action programmes and funds that pursue similar objectives in related fields of competence.  It contributes to addressing policy priorities for the Single Market and for the Customs Union , in line with the Single Market Strategy, the European Economic Security Strategy 20 , the Commission’s Customs Reform Proposal , European Data Strategy and the Savings and Investments Union Strateg y . A s highlighted by the European Parliament in its Resolution on the 30 th anniversary of the Single Market 21 , th is programm e is designed to be agile and continue to adapt to new challenges and evolving priorities.  The p rogramme is in line with the Single Market Strategy 22 and its objectives to mak e the Single Market simpler, fairer and strong er . The strategy aims to deepen and strengthen a data-based Single Market at the EU and national level , digit al ising administration and reducing administrative barriers, to increase coordination of market surveillance authorities and to improve cooperation with customs authorities , tapping into synergies with capacities of the EU and national customs and market surveillance authorities and potentially establishing an EU Market Surveillance Authority . The actions set out in the strategy will stimulate reform s , make and simplify rules to remove barriers to the free movement of goods and services and improve the implementation and enforcement of Single Market , with which the objectives of th is P rogramme are fully aligned . Shielding the Single Market from the disruptive impacts of crisis requires identifying weaknesses and ensuring appropriate, coordinated and swift responses . The Internal Market Emergency and Resilience Act (IMERA) aims to anticipate, prepare for and respond to the impact of future crise s . It establishes governance structures, a crisis framework, and tools to safeguard the free movement of goods, persons, and services in times of emergency.  The programme will also facilitate the free movement of capital, the access of firms to investment and the competitiveness of the Union’s economy by providing support for the implementation of Regulation 1606/2002 on the application of international financial reporting standards 23 and of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) 24 .  Regulation 1606/2002 requires the incorporation into Union law of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS Accounting Standards) adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board and related interpretations from the IFRS Interpretations Committee, so long as company accounts give a ‘true and fair view’ 25 and that the standards are conducive to the European public good. The programme will, therefore, continue Union support for the development of IFRS Accounting Standards and for the work of EFRAG 26 in assessing whether the requirements for their incorporation into Union law are satisfied.  The programme will also allow continued support for EFRAG’s involvement in the development of European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) in accordance with the CSRD.  The programme is consistent with the Union Customs Code 27 , the Commission’s proposal on the Customs Union Reform 28 and other legislation that the customs authorities apply. T h e p rogramme is furthermore in line with and supports the EU E conomic S ecurity S trategy 29 . It is consistent with the objective to support the functioning and modernisation of the C ustoms U nion in order to strengthen the S ingle M arket by means of cooperation between participating countries, their customs authorities and their officials.  Th e pro gramme will provide the operational, organisational, methodological and budgetary framework to implement EU customs policy objectives and activities. While the p rogramme incorporates the current stand-alone Customs programme, it is expected to maintain coverage for the interventions and objectives relevant for the Customs Union . It will have a critical role of ensuring the transition to the future EU customs policy landscape, introduced by the proposal of the Customs Union Reform , which includ es the establishment of an EU Customs Authority and the development and operation of an EU Customs Data Hub as well as operation of the legacy customs digital systems up until their overhaul by the EU Customs Data Hub . T he legacy customs digital systems must continue to be maintained up until they are replaced by the EU Customs Data Hub. T he programme will also integrate the 2021-2027 CCEI 30 type targeted interventions to be implemented by the new EU Customs Authority , pri marily to support the enlargement countries and address crisis situations .  The programme is in line with the Commission agenda to ensure a fair and efficient tax system in the Union with a view, inter alia, to enhancing the functioning of the Single Market, to fostering competitiveness and fair competition in the Union; protecting the financial and economic interests of the Union and its Member States, including protecting those interests from tax fraud, tax evasion and tax avoidance, and improving tax collection. Many of the initiatives adopted in this framework aim at increasing tax transparency and enhancing administrative cooperation, through measures such as the exchange of relevant tax information.  T he new p rogramme incorporates the current stand-alone Fiscalis programme, but is expected to maintain the same Fis c alis interventions and objectives. It will therefore provide the budgetary and other means to support and implement these regulatory interventions . Important features of this administrative cooperation are the relevant European electronic systems, which enable Member States tax authorities to exchange information on the implementation of the ‘ VAT in the Digital Age package ’ 31 , the Directive on Administrative Cooperation ( DAC ) 32 , the Faster and Safer Tax Relief of Excess Withholding Taxes Directive ( FASTER ) 33 and other priorities . Through the anti-fraud activities that it promotes, th is new p rogramme directly address es several of the EU ’ s priorities, as fraud , corruption and other illegal activities directly undermine the E U ’s goals in areas like financial stability, economic growth, rule of law, and public trust. T he funded anti-fraud initiatives will also advance other Commission policy priorities, particularly in relation to the enhanced digitalisation of national law enforcement authorities.  The p rogramme is expected to deliver substantial EU added value by co-financing activities aimed at improving the cross-border collection and exchange of data as well as providing Member States with EU-level intelligence on emerging patterns of fraud . The support provided for anti-fraud measures will promote cooperation and optimise the utilisation of Member States’ resources in the prevention and detection of fraud, corruption and other illegal activities , thereby safeguarding EU taxpayers’ funds. In the context of the ongoing review of the EU Anti-Fraud Architecture 34 , the programme will thus contribute to a strengthened and more efficient anti-fraud architecture to protect the EU’s financial interests .  · Consistency with other Union policies and initiatives  The programme is consistent with other proposed EU policies that pursue similar objectives in related fields of competence.  It aims for a strong integrated Single Market, which is critical for European competitiveness , resilience and economic security , as highlighted by the Competitiveness Compass , the 2025 Single Market and Competitiveness Report 35 , and the 2025 Single Market Strategy . The challenges underpinning competitiveness in all this are simplification, stimulating reforms, removing barriers in the Single Market, enabling more efficient financing and ensuring better coordination for implementation of shared EU policy objectives at EU and national level.  Activities under the programme are complementary and seek synergies with other proposals for EU action programmes under the next MFF such as National and Regional Partnership Plans, the European Competitiveness Fund, Horizon Europe and Global Europe . Actions supported by the programme seek to improve the functioning and shielding the external borders of the Single Market and Customs Union as the home market for EU industry and businesses and a vector for competitiveness. Similarly, actions supported by the programme to improve administrative and operational capacity through cross-border cooperation among Member States including EU level digital solutions and human competency building projects complement actions developed by Member States under the National and Regional Partnership Plans. Moreover, the programme is consistent with existing cohesion policy tools for addressing administrative and legal barriers hampering the functioning of the Single Market, such as the BridgeforEU Regulation.  Moreover, EU competition law has an essential role to play in ensuring the proper functioning of the single market, as is recognised explicitly in both the Treat y on the EU (TEU) and the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) 36 . The effectiveness of competition policy in the single market is in turn an essential driver of EU competitiveness, as competition stimulates productivity, investment and innovation . In the coming years the field of competition enforcement will face new or growing challenges, including at the global level, which are likely to significantly increase both threats to competition and, the complexity of enforcement.  The programme is also consistent with the Joint White Paper on Defence Readiness and the Commission Political Guidelines, which stress the importance of building a true European Single Market for defence products and services for achieving defence readiness.  The p rogramme also supports Union’s ambition on sustainability including climate , energy and environmental objectives and social responsibilities that are often delivered through product specific legislation or trade arrangements. It is consistent with the objectives of the European Green Deal and the Clean Industrial Deal , by ensuring the proper control of products being placed on the Single Market in relation to their compliance with environmental standards. The p rogramme may also support measures related to the polluter pays principle, including through green taxes. The p rogramme may also support customs authorities in the greening of their own operations. The programme is consistent with the CBAM 37 provisions.  The programme aims to make the Single Market and Customs Union more effective in the era of digitalisation providing funding to assist the digitalisation of services and businesses and facilitates Single Market access and international cooperation. Digital tools are fundamental for effective policy implementation and for supporting reforms. The programme will aim at increasing the relevance and timeliness of European statistics while limiting the reporting burden through leveraging new data sources and ethical use of digital technologies, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), implementing the once-only principle and further digitalisation of data collections.  To ensure consistency and complementarity of EU action, the programme should be implemented in synergy with other Union programmes, in particular the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) . Coordination with CEF – Transport should be promoted, especially in areas where customs digitalisation intersects with physical infrastructure investments, such as smart border crossings, multimodal logistics hubs, and cross-border transport corridors, including military mobility.  The free movement of persons, including for the purpose of employment, is one of the fundamental freedoms of the Single Market. While this programme does not directly support labour nor learning mobility, it complements Union instruments such as Erasmus+ and the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+), which contribute to facilitating lifelong learning mobility, mutual recognition of qualifications, and cross-border skills development. These instruments support the practical realisation of the free movement of people and help address labour market imbalances across the Union. A well-functioning housing market is also vital to ensure labour mobility . The present programme contributes to the legal, regulatory, and administrative framework underpinning this freedom, including by fostering cooperation between competent authorities and supporting rule enforcement in the Single Market.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  · Legal basis  The proposed new programme is expected to continue the interventions of the 2021-2027 programmes which will be merged, with some adjustments, into one programme, therefore keeping their respective legal bases. The legal bases of the programme are:  – Article 33 TFEU on customs cooperation in the Customs Union;  – Article 114 TFEU on achieving the objectives of the internal market;  – Article 169 TFEU c oncerning consumer protection;  – Article 197 TFEU on administrative cooperation ;  – Article 207 TFEU on common commercial policy;  – Article 325 TFEU on the protecti o n of the financial interests of the Union ; and  – Article 338 TFEU on statistics .  · Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  The EU faces global competition from other major economic blocs and needs to ensure that the Single Market remains competitive, performing, accessible and innovative and provides a level playing field for stakeholders. A more flexible and streamlined funding system could boost the Single Market’s global competitiveness and the level playing field.  The EU’s funding landscape needs to be resilient and agile to respond to emerging crises and changing needs and to adapt to the digital transition and rapid technological change. Rigid rules make it difficult to redirect funds quickly or pivot to new priorities and hamper the EU’s ability to tackle urgent issues.  More flexible funding boosts collaboration and cross-border projects . C ooperation and harmonisation offer transnational and cross-border   benefits and economies of scale for national authorities in the implementation of EU policies and for businesses, consumers, investors and citizens. Streamlined rules and faster approval processes could help share knowledge and co-develop solutions to challenges such as continuously evolving trade patterns, climate change, and digital transformation.  Today’s challenges require a collective and coordinated EU response due to their global nature and a high level of interdependence between Member States. This highlights the importance of coordinating policy actions. EU level funding is also essential to enable the Commission to fulfil its legal obligations (under the TFEU and related legislation) and address Single Market and Customs Union issues falling in its competence. It is also essential to support cooperation among Member States to fulfil their legal obligations (under the TFEU and related legislation) regarding the functioning of the Single Market in a number of areas, such as customs, market surveillance, product conformity, standardisation, consumer protection, public procurement, crisis management, taxation and anti-fraud. Moreover, the objectives of providing reliable, relevant and comparable European statistics necessary for performing Union activities cannot be achieved by Member States acting alone. Setting a programming framework at EU level is needed. The programming framework for European statistics will be implemented by coordinated statistical actions and partnership between Eurostat and the national statistical authorities, as foreseen in Regulation (EC) 223/2009 on European statistics. Hence, action at EU level is necessary to ensure that accompanying measures to ensure and improve the functioning of the Single Market are in place, complementing actions developed at Member States level.  Although the Customs Union is an area of EU exclusive competence with a single Union Customs Code 38 39 , the implementation of this legislation remains entirely with the Member States. The Customs Union can therefore only be as strong as its weakest link . Strong operational cooperation , including digital integration , is key to enable customs authorities to act as one and to ensure correct collection of customs duties , import VAT, excise , other duties and levies and to cover the non-financial tasks of increasing importance .  In the tax area , a versatile and complex legal and digital landscape, efforts on harmonisation and approximation of tax law and administrative actions, as well as rapidly emerging needs prompt the demand for EU interventions, inviting for support Member States in their effort and responsibility to implement Union law. A significant part of the EU tax legislation requires modern digital solutions to be put in place for allowing exchanging information in relation to taxpayers (citizens or businesses) or cross-border transactions, including on cryptocurrency. This exchange of information amongst Member States takes place because EU funding allows financing EU-level electronic systems, or their common components. Without such financial support no common electronic systems would be developed, and many EU legislative acts would remain unimplemented, or their implementation would suffer from important delays and technical obstacles.  Union action is needed to underpin the European dimension of single market, customs, taxation and anti-fraud authorities work, to avoid internal market distortions and to support the effective protection of the Union external borders. EU level funding is essential to enable the Commission to fulfil its various legal obligations (under the TFEU and related legislation) and address Single Market and Customs Union issues falling in its competence.  In addition,  g iven the strong digital dimension of the policy areas covered by the programme, strengthened collaboration between public sector organisations at EU, national, regional and local level across the EU is necessary to facilitate seamless data exchanges to improve policy implementation and reduce the administrative burden.  Consequently, this programme can only be established at EU level as the actions require active cooperation and coordination between Member States.  · Proportionality  The programme will help to effectively enforce and modernise the Union legal framework and to adapt it rapidly to the ever-changing environment. This will be done, among other things, through data-gathering and analyses, studies, evaluations and policy recommendations, administrative, operational (including digital), and capacity-building activities, a more centralised digital environment and joint actions between Member States and between their competent authorities and the Commission. The programme will also strengthen the exchange and dissemination of expertise and knowledge, support harmonised standard setting and contribute to rulemaking, implementation, monitoring and interpretation of EU law. It will also support mechanisms allowing individuals, consumers and business representatives to contribute to decision-making processes.  None of the actions goes beyond what is absolutely necessary to achieve the programme’s objectives in enhancing and deepening the functioning of the Single Market and a strong Customs Union, and protecting the financial and economic interests of the EU and its Member States.  T he actions are based on analysis of actual needs on the ground but also taking into account the legal requirements in the policy areas covered by the programme. The European Commission will exercise coordinating, executive and management functions, as laid down in the Treaties.  The European statistics programming framework will be implemented according to the principles of cost-effectiveness and limiting administrative burden, leveraging emerging technologies and re-use of existing administrative, publicly and privately available data sources.  Consequently, the objectives of the programme will be achieved in a much more proportionate manner at EU level than at the level of the Member States.  Section 3.3 of the Impact Assessment describes the European Union value added of the programme.  · Choice of the instrument  As the impact assessment concludes, EU action through a funding programme is appropriate.  Merging the four existing programmes into one single programme will improve the consistency and integration of actions in the respective policy areas. At the same time, it will reduce the number of divergent and fragmented financing rules and will streamline the implementation. In accordance with the legislative policy the Commission has adopted under the MFF, the funding programme is proposed as a Regulation.  3. RESULTS OF RETROSPECTIVE EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  · Retrospective evaluations of existing legislation  The programme builds on findings and lessons learned from the finalised and ongoing evaluations of its predecessor programmes.  The interim evaluation of the Single Market Programme (SMP) showed nuanced conclusions for the first three years of implementation (2021-2023). T he evaluation conclude d that the programme’s key activities contributed to a large extent to the achievement of its general and specific objectives. T he SMP has partially delivered on the flexibility and synergies 40 expected from designing an integrated programme .  P reliminary findings from the interim evaluations of the 2021-2027 Fiscalis and Customs 41 programmes , also confirm their overall positive contribution towards the objectives, while indicating that there is room for further simplification in the monitoring and evaluation framework procedures . The final evaluations of the 2014-2020 Customs and Fiscalis programmes have concluded the overall positive benefits of the EU level programme interventions 42 .  In line with Article 13 of Regulation 2021/785 43 on the U nion A nti- F raud P rogramme (UAFP) , the Commission ’s anti-fraud office (OLAF) performed an interim evaluation of the UAFP for the period between January 2021 and January 2024 44 , based on an external study 45 . The evaluation concluded that the UAFP effectively reduces the EU’s financial exposure to fraud and is aligned with broader goals, emerging fraud trends, and EU policy priorities, particular ly further digitalis ing fraud combating services . Its first component (‘Hercule’) enhances investigative and technical capacities through grants for equipment acquisition and training actions, which have resulted in high beneficiary satisfaction rates. Its anti-fraud information system ( AFIS ) facilitates fraud-related information exchange between EU and national law enforcement agencies, to a level that exceeds performance targets. Its irregularity management system ( IMS ) is an essential tool for reporting, tracking and monitoring irregularities or suspected fraud related to EU (structural) funds, and the user satisfaction with th is system is high. The UAFP remains relevant, as it is aligned with broader goals, emerging fraud trends, and EU policy priorities, particular ly further digitalis ing fraud combating services.  · Stakeholder consultations  A public consultation on EU funding for the single market, and cooperation between national administrations took place between 12 February and 7 May 2025. It targeted a wide range of stakeholders, including citizens, businesses, SMEs, public authorities, recipients of EU funding, civil society organisations, consumer organisations, academia, and international stakeholders. It included an online questionnaire and the option to submit position papers. In total, 747 survey responses and 161 position papers were received from EU citizens, public authorities, non-governmental organisations, and other stakeholders (including government bodies, banking institutions, chambers of commerce), predominantly from European countries. This input informed how the Commission designed this legislative proposal.  The most widely recognised challenges pertaining to the Single Market and cooperation between national authorities included (i) ensuring that rulemaking, standard setting, and enforcement at the EU level remain evidence-based, effective, and tailored to evolving needs; (ii) improving cooperation and collaborative efforts between Member States and the Commission; and (iii) empowering stakeholders by addressing knowledge and data gaps.  The respondents considered it important to address all the challenges identified, including regulatory fragmentation, differences in the interpretation of EU legislation, and the fragmented and complex digital environment. Additional challenges identified by respondents in an open-ended follow-up question include excessive bureaucracy and regulatory fragmentation, uneven enforcement of EU rules across Member States, and a need for greater harmonisation in areas such as taxation, accounting, environmental standards, and digital regulation.  Respondents to the public consultation expect policies in the scope of the public consultation to address to the highest extent the following challenges: improving cooperation, collaborative efforts, and integration; empowering stakeholders by addressing knowledge and data gaps; and overcoming barriers and ensuring evidence-based and adaptive EU rulemaking and enforcement.  As regards the structure and procedural barriers limiting the effectiveness of the EU budget in achieving its objectives, the most relevant challenges were administrative burdens, and fragmented and complex rules for accessing funding and compliance.  Respondents showed broad support for simplifying procedures and improving the design of funding instruments. The highest levels of support were expressed for simplifying access to and information about funding for beneficiaries and clearer, fewer and simpler rules.  The most important areas of EU-level action identified are: supporting fair competition; supporting standardisation efforts; and deploying common and/or interoperable digital solutions. When asked about other potential strategic areas to be covered by a well-functioning single market, Customs Union, and related measures, some respondents emphasised the need for harmonised tax and customs rules, reduced administrative burdens – especially for SMEs – and stronger digital infrastructure and cybersecurity across the EU. Member State authorities placed higher importance than other groups on several areas, including deploying common and/or interoperable digital solutions and supporting EU economic security.  Replies also indicated that an EU-level action would provide the most added value by supporting cross-border and multi-country projects and cooperation; strengthening the competitiveness and sustainability of EU businesses; and addressing transnational challenges.  Detailed results of the public consultation are presented in the Impact Assessment (Annex 2) accompanying the legal proposal.  Last, in accordance with the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 on European statistics, the draft programming framework for European statistics as set out in the Annex has been submitted to the European Statistical System Committee for prior examination.  Impact assessment  The impact assessment analysed the following two overall scenarios for the design of the programme:  (1) Integrated scenario  Under this scenario, current programmes related to Single Market, Customs Union, taxation, and anti-fraud policies would be brought together under a flexible framework with one single legal proposal. Further harmonisation of legal provisions would deliver a single, more streamlined flexible framework while still maintaining a clear division between existing programmes and policy areas. This scenario preserves existing policy objectives and governance models, avoiding disruptions and ensuring continuity. A horizontal programme structure could promote flexibility, simplification and more synergies. Bringing together programmes with a cross-thematic nature, including their complex and diverse activities, requires strengthened coordination and governance.  (2) Unified scenario  This scenario would consolidate policy priorities in the area of the Single Market, Customs Union, taxation, and anti-fraud policies, including cooperation between national authorities, in a single legislative act with one set of legal and institutional requirements for all activities.  Bringing together all concerned policy areas, objectives and expected results and impacts, the programme architecture and implementation procedures would ensure budget security for legal obligations as well as more flexibility and adaptability to emerging needs and shifting priorities.  A unified scenario was considered the preferred option. It was considered to best address all identified problems and problem drivers (both in terms of the programme design and the policy areas covered), bearing in mind that – along with simplifications and synergies - more flexibility is key in guaranteeing the budget’s ability to respond to a changing reality.  The impact assessment received an ‘opinion without qualification’ from the Regulatory Scrutiny Board on 13 June 2025. The Board’s recommendations were addressed in the revised version of the impact assessment.  · Simplification  The programme brings together four predecessor programmes notably, the Single Market Programme (excluding the SME and ‘food and feed’ pillars), the Customs programme including the CCEI-type interventions, the Fiscalis programme and the Union Anti-Fraud Programme  It will make it possible to streamline actions across a broader range of policy areas, thereby building and exploiting more synergies between the various actions and provide a more flexible and agile financing framework aimed at enhancing and deepening a well- functioning Single Market and a strong Customs Union, protecting the financial and economic interests of the EU and its Member States, most cost-efficiently. Public authorities (including competent authorities at national level) will benefit directly from better policymaking and law enforcement thanks to capacity building, enhanced cooperation and streamlined administrative procedures further enhancing policy synergies.  Stakeholders are expected to benefit from simplifications in the programme design, e.g. with joint procurement, or joint framework contracts, and from horizontal activities that would otherwise not take place at the same level. Simplification and flexibilities in the programme design and the implementation of new horizontal activities will make policy development and law enforcement more effective and will allow new or better services to be provided to citizens, consumers and businesses. Programme management may also be less burdensome for the Commission, and beneficial to applicants, facilitating access to funding as well as minimising administrative burden, for instance with harmonised legal provisions, common reporting templates, a single set of requirements, or a common rulebook.  · Fundamental rights  The programme ensures the full respect of the rights and principles set out in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and in other international human rights conventions to which Member States and the Union are party to, such as the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and contributes to the implementation of several of those rights. Its objectives are notably to ensure citizens’ health (in accordance with Article 35 of the Charter) and consumer protection (in accordance with Article 38 of the Charter). It also contributes to the right to effective remedy and fair trial as prescribed by Article 47 of the Charter. The programme also aims to improve the freedom to conduct a business in accordance with Union law and national laws and practices (Article 16 of the Charter).  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  On 16 July 2025, the Commission adopted a proposal for the next Multiannual Financial Framework for the period2028-2034. In accordance with this proposal, this Regulation contains a budgetary framework of EUR 6 238 112 000 (in current prices) for the period 2028-2034.  5. OTHER ASPECTS  · Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  The programme will be implemented under direct management in accordance with the Financial Regulation, particularly through grants and procurement (some of which will potentially be managed by an executive agency), and/or under indirect management with bodies referred to in Article 62(1), first paragraph, point (c), and Article 157/158/159.  The Commission’s C ustoms R eform proposal – under negotiation s between the co-legislators – s pecifies that the Commission may entrust the EU Customs Authority with tasks for implementing of the customs-related funding programmes such as the development, operation and maintenance of the EU Customs Data Hub . The Authority may also be tasked with activities relating to the allocation, funding and procurement of customs control equipment, including the assessment of needs, joint procurement and co- sharing of equipment 46 .  The 2025 Single Market Strategy presents several actions to address structural problems and improve the governance of the Single Market in the policy areas of standardisation, conformity assessment and market surveillance and, to take effective action to increase product compliance by tapping into synergies between the EU and national customs and market surveillance authorities and potentially establishing an EU Market Surveillance Authority.  · Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  The scope of the programme covers the area of the Single Market and cooperation between national administrations in a comprehensive manner. The general objective of the programme is to enhance and deepen the functioning of the Single Market and a strong Customs Union, to protect the financial and economic interests of the EU and its Member States, with a design fostering flexibility, simplification and synergies.  The programme will be open to participation by the Member States, European Free Trade Association (EFTA) members which are the members of the European Economic Area (EEA), acceding countries, candidate countries and potential candidate countries. In line with overall Union policy, countries covered by the European Neighbourhood Policy and other non-EU countries will also have the possibility to take part in the programme under certain conditions. In addition, the programme will be open to Switzerland in accordance with the conditions established in the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on cooperation in the field of statistics.  The programme will be implemented through public procurement and grants .  Generic types of actions will apply to all specific objectives. These include:  – d igital capacity building, development and operation of centralised and decentralised European electronic systems and digital solutions , implementation tools and data  – s upport for policy and regulatory work ( studies, communication, impact assessment, evaluation and simplification proposals etc.)  – c ollaboration and cooperation between Member States , the Commission, EU agencies and national authorities , as well as cooperation between Member States, the Commission and third countries  – a dministrative and o perational/technical capacity building ( including purchase , maintenance, upgrade of equipment – notably customs control equipment – infrastructure etc. and related costs )  – human competency building , including training  – development of joint tools, methods, data and statistics to support policy making  _            other actions to achieve the general and specific objectives (innovation, testing etc.).  In implementing actions to deliver on the European statistics programming framework, synergies will be developed within the European Statistical System through collective networks by sharing expertise and results or by fostering specialisation on specific task. The outcomes of those actions, such as joint tools, methods and infrastructures, will be made available throughout the European Statistical System.  Implementation of the programme should be based on annual or multiannual work programmes. The mid- to long-term nature of the objectives pursued and the need to build on experience gained over time, work programmes may cover several years. Multiannual work programmes will reduce the administrative burden without hampering the implementation of the programme.  2025/0590 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  establishing the Single Market and Customs Programme for the period 2028-2034 and repealing Regulations (EU) 2021/444, (EU) 2021/690, (EU) 2021/785, (EU) 2021/847 and (EU) 2021/1077  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articl e 33, Article 114(1), Article 169(3), Article 197(2), Article 207(2), Article 325(4), Article 338(1) thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the Court of Auditors 47 ,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 48 ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) This Regulation lays down a n indicative financial envelope for th e ‘Single Market , and Customs Programme for the period 2028-2034 ’ ( the ‘ p rogramme’ ) . For the purpose of this Regulation, current prices are calculated by applying a fixed 2% deflator.  (2) In a rapidly changing economic, social and geopolitical environment, recent experience has shown the need for a more flexible multiannual financial framework and Union spending pr ogrammes. To that effect, and in line with the objectives of this regulation, the funding should consider the evolving policy needs and Union’s priorities as identified in relevant documents published by the Commission, in Council conclusions and Parliament resolutions while ensuring sufficient predictability for the budget implementation.  (3) Regul ati on (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 of the European Parliament and of the Council 49 applies to th e p rogramme. It lays down the rules on the establishment and the implementation of the general budget of the Union, including the rules on grants, prizes, non-financial donations, procurement, indirect management , financial assistance, financial instruments and budgetary guarantees.  (4) In accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509, Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council 50 , Council Regulation s ( EC, Euratom) No 2988/95 51 , ( EC, Euratom) No 2185/96 52 and (EU) 2017/1939 53 , the financial interests of the Union are to be protected through proportionate measures, including the prevention, detection, correction and investigation of irregularities and fraud, the recovery of funds lost, wrongly paid or incorrectly used and, where appropriate, the imposition of administrative sanctions. I n accordance with Regulation s (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 and ( EC, Euratom) No 2185/96 , the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) may carry out investigations, including on-the-spot checks and inspections, with a view to establishing whether there has been fraud, corruption or any other illegal activity affecting the financial interests of the Union. In accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017/1939, the European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO) may investigate and prosecute fraud and other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Union as provided for in Directive (EU) 2017/1371 of the European Parliament and of the Council 54 . In accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509, any person or entity receiving Union funds is to fully cooperate in the protection of the Union’s financial interests, to grant the necessary rights and access to the Commission, OLAF, the EPPO and the European Court of Auditors and to ensure that any third parties involved in the implementation of Union funds grant equivalent rights.  (5) The p rogramme is to be implemented in accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) 202 5 /XXXX of the European Parliament and of the Council 55 establishing a budget expenditure tracking and performance framework and other horizontal rules for the Union programmes and activities , including rules for ensuring a uniform application of the principles of ‘do no significant harm’ and gender equality referred to in Article 33(2), points (d) and (f), of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 respectively , the principles of preparedness and climate resilience by design, rules for monitoring and reporting on the performance of Union programmes and activities, rules for establishing a Union funding portal, rules for the evaluation of the programmes, as well as other horizontal provisions applicable to all Union programmes such as those on information, communication and visibility.  (6) Pursuant to Article 85(1) of Council Decision (EU) 2021/1764 56 , persons and entities established in overseas countries and territories (OCTs) are eligible for funding under the p rogramme and subject to possible arrangements applicable to the Member State to which the relevant overseas country or territory is linked.  (7) T he S ingle Market is governed by the fundamental principles of free movement of goods, services, people, and capital and has been a major contributor to growth, competitiveness and emp loymen t . A well-functioning and safe-guarded Single Market is a pre-requisite for a competitive , safe and secure Union economy and for advancing the Savings and Investments Union . A s stressed by the new approach proposed by the Single Market Strategy , more action is needed to address the barriers , stimulate reforms, reduce fragmentation and complete the Single Market , especially in the context of new global challenges .This has been and will continue to be reinforced by an effective cohesion policy as an additional key condition for the success of the Single Market. The Member States and the Commission share the responsibility for enforcing Union law to ensure compliance with Single Market rules and to protect people’s and business es ’ rights. The Union -level responsibility combines three main aspects: removal of barrier s , collaboration between Member States, and corrective implementation and enforcement actions and stimulating reforms . Barriers such as knowledge and data gaps , and gold plating are obstacles for citizens, consumers, businesses, investors, economic operators to access and operate within the S ingle M arket . Capacity building, administrative and operational cooperation , including digital cooperation, and integration among Member States and between Member States and the Commission remain suboptimal and could be reinforced to improve efficiency and a level-playing field. Low efficiency and lack of flexibility in rulemaking, standard setting and enforcement may hamper their adaptability . There is a need to combine the infrastructure accompanying and enabling the lifting of internal barriers and the infrastructure protecting the external borders of the Single Market.  (8) Under the multiannual financial framework for the years 2021 to 2027 laid down in Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2020/2093 57 , t he Single Market Programme ( ‘ SMP ’ ) established by Regulation (EU) 2021/690 of the European Parliament and of the Council 58 supports the design, implementation and enforcement of Union legislation underpinning the proper functioning of the Single Market , so that it can reach its full potential . The Customs programme established by Regulation (EU) 2021/444 of the European Parliament and of the Council 59 and the Fiscalis programme established by Regulation (EU) 2021/847 of the European Parliament and of the Council 60 accompany the customs and tax policies in the Union by supporting Union level digital solutions for customs and taxation, project based collaborative activities as well as human competency building activities . In addition, the Customs Control Equipment Instrument established as part of the Integrated Border Management Fund by Regulation (EU) 2021/1077 of the European Parliament and of the Council 61 , contributes to increasing the efficient and effective customs controls, essential for the facilitation of legitimate trade, while ensuring sufficient level of protection at the external borders . The Union Anti-Fraud Programme ( ‘ UAFP ’ ) established by Regulation (EU) 2021/785 of the European Parliament and of the Council 62 funds actions which aim to prevent and combat fraud, corruption and other illegal activities such as money-laundering , affecting the Union 's financial interests and to foster Member States’ cooperation in this field among one another and with the Commission .  (9) W ith economic and security uncertainty caused by geopolitical challenges and trade tensions, the Single Market is our anchor for stability and resilience . T h o se challenges require a collective and coordinated Union response considering their scale and the high levels of interdependence among Member States and regions . I n addition, an adequate level of protection and resulting benefits for citizens, consumers , investors and businesses could not be achieved solely through actions at national level , nor could it generate economies of scale , especially given the cross-border nature of th o se benefits.  (10) Union funding is required to enable the Commission to meet legal obligations of the Union that cannot be delegated to Member States, ensuring obligations under Union law are fulfilled , in particular in the areas of customs, market surveillance, product conformity, consumer protection, financial services, standard setting, competition policy, the provision of European statistics, taxation and anti-fraud .  (11) It is therefore appropriate to establish a p rogramme to enhance and deepen the functioning of the Single Market and a strong Customs Union and to protect the financial and economic interests of the Union and the Member S tates, with a design fostering flexibility, simplification and synergies , and supporting the horizontal policy mainstreaming priorities including what is set out in Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2025/XXXX of the European Parliament and of the Council 63 establishing a budget expenditure tracking and performance framework and other horizontal rules for the Union programmes and activities . The following four programmes should therefore be merged in one single p rogramme : parts of the Single Market Programme, excluding the small and medium-sized enterprises and food and feed strands, the Customs programme, including the Customs Control Equipment Instrument type interventions, the Fiscalis programme and the Union Anti-Fraud programme. A continuous and agile funding should be ensured in the area s of the Single Market, customs, taxation and anti-fraud, including funding for cooperation between national administrations encompassing activities such as streamlin ing administrative processes, harmonis ing rules across Member States, or facilitat ing quicker responses to evolving challenges with a comprehensive preparedness and crisis-response framework .  (12) In this regard, t he p rogramme should enable the implementation of the following generic types of actions : (a) digital capacity building, development and operation of centralised and decentralised European electronic systems and digital solutions, implementation tools and data; (b) support to policy, regulatory and enforcement work, for example, through studies, communication, impact assessment, evaluation and simplification proposals; (c) collaboration and cooperation between Member States, the Commission, Union agencies and national authorities and with stakeholders ; (d) administrative and operational/technical capacity building, including purchase, maintenance, upgrade of equipment – notably customs control equipment – infrastructure and related costs; (e) human competency building; ( f ) joint tools, methods, data and statistics to support policy making (g) other actions to achieve the general and specific objectives, such as innovation, testing.  (13) In light of the growing digitalisation of the economy and society, t here is a n increasing need for citizens, consumers, investors, economic operators, businesses, and public administrations to have timely, accurate and a ccess ible information and advice on the functioning of the Single Market and their rights and obligations under Union law. Furthermore , reinforced cooperation and integration to ensure digitally enabled, seamless implementation, consistent and effective enforcement across the Union and to prevent barriers and limitations hindering the proper functioning of the Single Market , tax ation , anti-fraud policies and the Customs Union should be enabled . Union authorities and bodies should maintain effective rulemaking, standard setting, as well as implementation and enforcement of Union law in the face of changing circumstances and to ensure enforcement of restrictive measures in the management of Union funds.  (14) The p rogramme should therefore further improve the functioning of the Single Market , including the external dimension, protect and empower citizens, consumers and businesses . Th at should be achieved by developing, implementing and enforcing Union law, offering digital tools and solutions , facilitating market access and public procurement, ensuring resilience , management of emergencies and security threats or crisis , s tandard s etting , and supporting the development of the Union regulatory f ra m e work . Th e p rogramme ’s actions should cover the areas of intellectual property rights, company law , anti-money laundering , and contract law, and by ensuring a high level of consumer protection , including protection of passenger rights, and market surveillance , financial literacy, the free movement of capital and financial services, effective and efficient competition enforcement , customs, anti-fraud , effective and efficient enforcement of Union restrictive measures and taxation . The p rogramme should also enhanc e cooperation between the competent authorities of Member States and the Commission, in parti cular cooperation and increased synergies between various national authorities, including national enforcement bodies, as well as cooperation between Member States , the Commission and third countries, including by providing digital solutions to improve information sharing among national authorities and with relevant stakeholders. It should allow to develop, produce and disseminate high-quality, comparable, timely and reliable European statistics . There is a need to implement cohesive digital solutions that facilitate and simplify doing business in the Union and with third countries and seize opportunities offered by the Single Market and Customs Union for citizens , consumers , investors and businesses , while respecting the Union’s climate objectives . Union coordinated platforms ensure cooperation among Member State’s authorities reducing fragmentation and duplication of efforts. Digital implementation tools reduce administrative burdens and create transparency . Different tools are designed to create synergies that facilitate and simplify doing business in the Union and in their international trade operations , enhancing day-to-day efficiency for businesses, fostering greater economic integration and drive innovation throughout the Union .  (15) European statistics are essential, as they underpin the design, monitoring and evaluation of all Union policies and empower all members of society to make informed decisions and to actively participate in the democratic process. Relevant and comparable official European statistics should be produced and disseminated to provide valuable insights and address knowledge gaps, allowing citizens, consumers, investors and businesses to benefit fully from the Single Market . In view of its horizontal character, the legal framework for the development, production and dissemination of European statistics established by Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council 64 is subject to specific requirements, and in particular those laid down in that Regulation, with regard to respect for statistical principles, as well as the functioning of the European Statistical System and its governance, including the role and tasks assigned to the European Statistical System Committee and to the Commission (Eurostat), and the establishment and implementation of the programming of the statistical activities.  (16) The p rogramme should ensure that the interests of consumers, including the end users of financial services, are represented at the Union level so that developments in the Single Market also respond to their needs and foster investor trust in the Single Market .  (17) The p rogramme aims to foster consumer and investor trust in the Single Market and the Customs Union by ensuring a high-level of consumer protection , including the protection of passengers, product safety and consumer empowerment , thereby enabling consumers to fully benefit from the Single Market and to contribute to a competitive, innovative, and dynamic Single Market. The p rogramme should safeguard consumers’ safety and rights as well as their legal and economic interests through concrete and effective measures which support, supplement and monitor the policy implemented by the Member States. Moreover, consumers should be empowered and encouraged to make sustainable and informed c hoices . It is necessary to ensure that consumer protection , rights and product safety requirements are effectively i mplemented, uniformly enforced, and consistently upheld across the Union, thereby contributing to the creation of a level-playing field for consumers , investors and businesses. Consumer organisations at both national and Union -level play a crucial role in promoting the interests of consumers, representing the interests of consumers in policy making, providing independent advice , raising awareness, and supporting consumers, in particular in-court and out-of-court in dispute resolution and in helping them understand and exercise their rights effectively. The p rogramme should strengthen the role and capacity of consumer organisations and European Consumer Centres to enable them to offer tailored guidance and advice to individual consumers . Furthermore , the p rogramme should support cooperation between national competent authorities, including those entrusted with the enforcement of consumer law and operating in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017/2394 and those carrying out enforcement tasks with regard to passenger rights in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2021/782, Regulation (EU) No 181/2011, Regulation (EU) No 1177/2010, Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 and Regulation (EC) No 1107/2006 . Capacity building measures are required to adapt investigation techniques and enforcement tools to the technological developments, such as the use of arti ficial intelligence. Measures are also necessary to strengthen the capacity of, and cooperation between market surveillance authorities responsible for monitoring product safety, notably through the Union’s Safety Gate Rapid Alert System for dangerous products operating in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2023/988 of the European Parliament and of the Council 65 and the Information and Communication System for Market Surveillance (ICSMS) under Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 of the European Parliament and of the Council 66 .  (18) Activities in market surveillance are instrumental in meeting the objectives of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 of the European Parliament and of the Council 67 and other Union legal acts requiring the Commission to recognise accreditation bodies and support networks . Such activities should improve the cooperation between Member States and support the harmonisation of ways of working and e-commerce surveillance. Market surveillance activities contribute to protect ing competitiveness of Union businesses, consumer safety and facilitate cross-border collaboration and sharing of expertise. Market surveillance ensures that non-food products on the Union market do not endanger Union consumers and workers. It also ensures the protection of other public interests such as  environment al protection and climate action , security and fairness in trade. Market surveillance has an important role to play in helping the EU delivering its Green Deal agenda, for example by ensuring that prohibitions and restrictions related to sustainability are properly implemented on imported products. The governance of the Single Market could be improved to address structural problems in the area of standardisation, conformity assessment and market surveillance . The Single Market Strategy proposes to t ake effective action to increase product compliance by tapping into synergies with capacities of the EU and national customs and market surveillance authorities and potentially establishing an EU Market Surveillance Authority .  (19) European standards play a pivotal role in fostering harmonisation across the Union and supporting key policy objectives . It is essential to ensure Union interests are represented in international standardisation landscape . Harmonisation of standards and digital regulation can address the fragmentation in Union rulemaking and enforcement as a barrier to a well-functioning Single Market. The p rogramme should deliver stronger coordination mechanisms, harmonised regulatory standards, and enhanced Union-level oversight.  (20) The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union ( TFEU ) includes a system of rules ensuring that competition is not distorted in the internal market and provides that the Union has exclusive competence in establishing competition rules. The p rogramme should contribute to the Union’s competition policy and , in particular, tackle the significant implications for competition and the functioning of the S ingle M arket resulting from the clean , just , competitive and digital transition of the economy and business environment . Using the right technology and skills to monitor markets, collect, process and analyse information more effectively is crucial for strengthening and speeding up the enforcement of competition rules . Th o se technologies should modernise competition policy and help to enhance the analysis and assessment of market developments. It is also essential that the p rogramme supports networks, reinforces cooperation with national authorities and courts, strengthens international cooperation, and ensures an outreach to a wider group of stakeholders in communicating and explaining the rights, benefits and obligations of the Union’s competition policy. The p rogramme should contribute to fair competition and a level playing field, including at global level, and empower businesses, and consumers to reap the benefits of the S ingle M arket. Overall, th at should also contribute to achieving the significant macroeconomic impacts of effective Union competition enforcement.  (21) The p rogramme should support the development and implementation of high-quality European and international corporate financial and non- financial reporting standards and a well-functioning common  reporting framework which are essential for the internal market, for the effective functioning of the capital markets and for the realisation of the integrated market for financial services in the context of the Savings and Investment s Union.  (22) The development of the Union regulatory framework in the areas of c ompany law and corporate governance, and contract law, is essential to mak e businesses more efficient and competitive, while providing protection for stakeholders affected by company operations, and to re spond to emerging policy challenges . The support to appropriate evaluation, implementation (including digital development) and enforcement of the relevant acquis , which inform and assist stakeholders , facilitate secure information exchange and ensure legal certainty with regard to the companies in the Single Market . The upcoming European Innovation Act and 28 th 68 regime for companies will directly contribute to the Union competitiveness. A clear and well-adapted legal framework for the data economy and innovation is necessary including digitalisation and sharing between companies and administrations using the European B usiness W allet , the Single Digital Gateway or other digital means for placing products in the Single Market such as the Digital Product Passport . It would enhance legal certainty with regard to contractual and extra contractual obligations, in particular with regard to liability, security, ethics and privacy in the context of advanced and emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence and quantum technologies. .  (23) The Customs Union remains the foundation of the Union and a fundamental enabler and guardian of the competitive Single Market and other Union political priorities , including European economic secu rity . The Customs Union is instrumental in implementing the Union’s commercial policy, in protecting the financial and economic interests of the Union and its Member States as well as ensuring safet y and security within the Union . I n response to the need to address the challenges , including the necessity to facilitat e legitimate international trade, the Customs Union and the related economic operators, as well as the national customs authorities face, i n light of the evolution of their role and of the business models in which they operate , on 17 May 2023, the Commission put forward a proposal 69 for the most ambitious and comprehensive reform of the Customs Union since its establishment in 1968. A more cost-efficient and effective cooperation framework governing the Customs Union is to be established , based on a new partnership among customs authorities and between customs and business es , and by establishing the EU Customs Authority which should devel op and manage the EU Customs Data Hub .  (24) Union tax policy plays a key role in the seamless functioning of the competitive internal market . I t support s consistent tax practices across Member States, fostering a level playing field and minimi s ing barriers to cross-border trade. Union tax policy does not only combat fragmentation and discrimination but also safeguards the financial interests of the Union and its Member States, promoting economic growth and encouraging investment within a competitive framework. Tax policy also contributes to the EU’s climate and environmental objectives. Fighting tax fraud, tax evasion and tax avoidance through enhanced cooperation and exchange of information is crucial for safeguarding th os e interests, alignment with the Union 's wider objectives and maintaining the trust of citizens and businesses in the integrity of the internal market. An efficient functioning of the S ingle M arket also requires simplification of tax systems and digitali s ation of public administrations to improve transparency and consistency, thereby promoting a competitive economic environment across Member States. Acknowledging the impact of digitali s ation on public administrations, including tax authorities, Union tax policy should leverage th o se digital opportunities to ensure fair taxation and efficient tax collection while offering a leaner and more efficient framework that reduces compliance burdens.  (25) In line with the established and future legal commitments at Union level , it is crucial to continue developing and operating Union components of digital solutions in the customs and taxation fields . Th o s e common components are essential for establishing a modern and efficient Customs Union and tax systems across the Union , and for enhancing the Union ’ s competitiveness at global level.  (26) The p rogramme should enable the continuation of the Customs programme including customs control equipment support interventions deployed in the 2021-2027 period by the Customs Control Equipment Instrument , and the Fiscalis programme and their predecessors. In th at respect, t he p rogramme should enable the continuation of supporting the work of the customs and tax authorities not only by ensuring a solid digital customs and tax environment but also by reinforcing expert networks, the shar ing of know-how and good practices, as well as by complementing the national efforts for training customs and tax officials and professionals with U nion level solutions . In that sense, the p rogramme should support the continued collaboration and cooperation between the national customs authorities as well as between national tax authorities and their cooperation with the Commission and with other national authorities, and their digital, administrative, human and operational capacity building (development and operation of electronic systems and digital solutions and tools, equipment, infrastructure, training, innovation, studies, evaluations , etc.). The importance of ensuring adequate and equivalent results of customs controls , – amongst other aspects – calls for the availability and optimal use of relevant and state-of-the-art customs control equipment, which should be facilitated by the p rogramme , in particular in case of crisis situations and in the countries neighbouring the Union’s external borders. Joint procurement should be encouraged as much as possible to achieve further efficiencies and economies of scale. The p rogramme should also enable the transition to a renewed Customs Union 70 .  (27) T he p rogramme should also contribute to ensuring th at EU customs control systems are equipped and interoperable to facilitate the smooth movement of military goods and equipment , in the light of the growing importance of military mobility . To this end, support could be pro vided for the digitalisation and coordination of the customs procedures, including the enhancement of civil-military customs cooperation.  (28) In accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509, the work programmes and the call documents are the appropriate place to set out more technical implementation details for the budget across the set of policies supported by the p rogramme, including specific eligibility and award criteria depending on the instrument of budget implementation, whether grant or procurement, and the specific policy objectives pursued. In accordance with Article 136 of the Financial Regulation, security requirements should be applied. Rest ric tions to high-risk supplier s should apply according to the relevant applicable provisions .  (29) Europe must protect its security interest against suppliers which could represent a persistent security risk due to the potential interference from third countries as well as their security, notably cybersecurity. It is therefore necessary to reduce the risk of persisting dependency on high-risk suppliers in the internal market, including in the ICT supply chain, as they could have potentially serious negative impacts on security for users and companies across the Union and the Union’s critical infrastructure in terms of the integrity of data and services as well as the availability of service. This restriction should be based on a proportionate risk assessment and associated mitigation measures as defined in the Union policies and laws.  (30) Union legislation setting out rules for Union funds under shared management and for pre-accession assistance regarding the programming period for the years 2014 to 2020 and onwards provides for an obligation on Member States, candidate countries and potential candidate countries to report irregularities and fraud affecting the financial interests of the Union. Based on that legislation and on related implementing regulations, the Commission is obliged to maintain the Irregularity Management System (IMS) as a secure electronic communications tool, which also supports the management and analysis of irregularities.  (31) Article 325 TFEU requires the Union and the Member States to counter fraud , corruption and any other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Union. The Union should support activities in those fields. In accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 515/97 71 and Council Decision 2009/917/JHA 72 the Union is to support mutual assistance between the administrative authorities of the Member States and cooperation between the latter and the Commission, to ensure the correct application of the law on customs and agricultural matters. That support covers not only anti-fraud activities in relation to customs fraud but also in relation to illicit trade in the fields of safety and security, health and the protection of the environment and is provided to a number of operational activities. Th o se include the Anti-Fraud Information System (AFIS), an information technology platform which consists of a set of applications operated under a common information system , managed by the Commission. Th at common information system comprising AFIS and IMS requires stable and predictable financing over the years in order to ensure its sustainability , which should be made available under the p rogramme, given the Commission’s legal obligations in th at respect and the importance of the system for the protection of the Unions and the Member States economic and financial interests.  (32) Third countries which are members of the European Economic Area (‘ EEA ’) may participate in the p rogramme in the framework of the cooperation established under the Agreement on the EEA 73 , which provides for the association to the programmes on the basis of a decision adopted under that Agreement. Third countries may also participate on the basis of other legal instruments. T hird countries should be required to grant the necessary rights and access required for the authorising officer responsible, OLAF and the Court of Auditors to comprehensively exercise their respective competences.  (33) In line with the Commission’s commitment to ensure the coherence and simplification of funding programmes, set out in its Communication of 11 February 2025 on ‘The road to the next multiannual financial framework’ 74 , resources should be shared with other Union funding instruments if the actions envisaged under the p rogramme pursue objectives that are common to various funding instruments, excluding double financing. Actions under the p rogramme should ensure coherence in the use of the Union’s resources supporting tax policy and tax authorities .  (34) Since the objectives of this Regulation , namely to enhance and deepen the well-functioning of a competitive Single Market and a strong Customs Union, and to protect the financial and economic interests , security and the safety of the Union and its Member States , cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States alone but can rather , by reason of legal obligation, scale and effects of the action , be better achieved at Union level, t he Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.  (35) T he draft part of the p rogramme regarding the framework for the development, production and dissemination of European statistics has been submitted for prior examination to the European Statistical System Committee in accordance with Article 13(4) Regulation (EC) No 223/2009.  (36) T h is Regulation replaces the p rogrammes established by Regulation s (EU) 2021/444, (EU) 2021/690, (EU) 2021/785, (EU) 2021/847 and (EU) 2021/1077 . T hose Regulations should therefore be repealed .  (37) To ensure the continuation of fulfilment of actions related to Union legal obligations and other actions or modification of the actions carried out under th ose Regulations , until their closure, transitional arrangements should be laid dow n ,  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Article 1 Subject matter  This Regulation establishes the Single Market and Customs Programme (the ‘programme’) and lays down the objectives of the programme, its budget for the period from 1 January 2028 to 31 December 2034 , the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding.

FRAMEWORK OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE  1.1. Title of the proposal/initiative  Single Market and Customs Programme  1.2. Policy area(s) concerned  Policy area: Single Market - Heading 2  Activity: Market surveillance, product conformity, standardisation, consumer protection, competition policy, company law, contract law, intellectual property rights, crisis management, public procurement, digital solutions, free movement of capital and financial services, anti-money laundering, European statistics, Union restrictive measures, customs including acquisition of customs control equipment, taxation, and anti-fraud.  1.3. Objective(s)  1.3.1. General objective(s)  The general objective of the programme is to enhance and deepen the functioning of a competitive Single Market and a strong Customs Union, to protect the financial and economic interests and security, safety of the Union and its Member States, with a design fostering flexibility, simplification and synergies, and supporting the Union’s horizontal policy mainstreaming priorities.  1.3.2. Specific objective(s)  The programme has the following specific objectives:  (a) to empower citizens, consumers, investors, economic operators and businesses by providing  information, guidance and advice enabling them to make informed decisions and to fully access the opportunities of the Single Market for goods, people, services and capital, to improve related digital and financial literacy, to ensure access to redress mechanisms, by  supporting representative organisations in their participative role; to improve the understanding of the Single Market and its challenges by supporting data collection and acquisition activities, analyses and tools;  (b) to foster cooperation among Member States national authorities, and between Member States national authorities, the Commission and other Union bodies in all programme areas, including the preparedness and economic security of the Single Market, and response to crises; to design, deploy, implement, run, maintain and support the common components of Union-level digital solutions and support the connection to them; to boost the operational, technical, and administrative capacities of national authorities, including customs and tax authorities;  (c) to facilitate harmonised standard-setting and reinforce the development of European and international standards, to ensure the effective design, uniform interpretation and implementation as well as the enforcement of Union law and monitoring of market fragmentation risk, also in relation with the verification of the conformity with the EU acquis by acceding countries, candidate countries and potential candidates;  (d) to support the Customs Union and customs authorities working together and acting as one in achieving their mission and contributing to Europe’s economic security, to ensure an effective market surveillance and a high level of consumer protection, product conformity and safety;  (e) to protect the Union’s and its Member States’ economic, financial and other interests  from fraud, corruption and other illegal activities, including risks related to expenditure, revenue and assets, as well as reputational risks, support Member States’ operational cooperation and investigation activities; to support tax policy and implementation of Union law relating to taxation and improve the Union taxation systems and tax collection in view of enhancing Europe’s competitiveness and investments;  (f) to improve evidence-based and digital-ready policymaking, and the use of digital implementation tools, as well as mutualisation of public data, to support the specific objectives set out in point (a) to (e) ;  (g) to provide relevant and comparable official European statistics as set out in the Annex.  1.3.3. Expected result(s) and impact  Specify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.  By addressing challenges and barriers the programme should cover various single market areas and would further unlock the potential, stimulate reforms and strengthen the Single Market and the Customs Union thereby enhancing Europe’s competitiveness and economic security and protecting safety, security and the financial and economic interests of the Union and its Member States.  1.3.4. Indicators of performance  Specify the indicators for monitoring progress and achievements.  The output and result indicators for the purpose of monitoring progress and achievements of this programme will correspond to the common indicators provided under the Regulation establishing a budget expenditure tracking and performance framework and other horizontal rules for the Union programmes and activities [Performance Regulation] 85 .  1.4. The proposal/initiative relates to:   a new action   a new action following a pilot project / preparatory action 86   the extension of an existing action   a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action  1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative  1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative  Set up of an internal governance structure for the coordination between European Commission Services, common approach at the establishment of a work programme, monitoring and reporting on programme implementation and achievement of results.  Delegation of powers to executive agencies. Assignment/delegation of tasks (for implementation) to decentralised authority(ies), such as EU Customs Authority, once such authority is established and operational to take over these tasks (using contribution agreements) including related to the development of the EU Customs Data Hub and suport to the acquisition of customs control equipment in the enlargement countries and addressing the crisis situations, preparation of programme documentation and standard documents for implementation, and the adaptation of programme management systems.  The programme should enable the implementation of the following generic types of actions: (a) digital capacity building, development and operation of centralised and decentralised European electronic systems and digital solutions, implementation tools and data; (b) support to policy and regulatory work, for example, through studies, communication, impact assessment, evaluation and simplification proposals; (c) collaboration and cooperation between Member States, the Commission, Union agencies and national authorities; (d) administrative and operational/technical capacity building, including purchase, maintenance, upgrade of equipment – notably customs control equipment – infrastructure and related costs; (e) skills development, human competency building (training); (f) development of joint tools, methods, data and statistics to support policy making; (g) other actions to achieve the general and specific objectives, such as innovation, testing.  1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, greater effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this section 'added value of EU involvement' is the value resulting from EU action, that is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.  Reasons for action at EU level (ex-ante): The EU faces global competition from other major economic blocs and needs to ensure that the Single Market remains competitive, performing, accessible and innovative and establishes a level playing field for stakeholders. A more flexible funding system — where programmes adapt to different needs and are easier to navigate for stakeholders — can foster and boost the single market’s global competitiveness and level playing field as well as strengthen the Customs Union. Flexible funding structures make it easier for stakeholders to collaborate across borders. In addition to streamlining, the EU’s funding landscape needs to display resilience and agility to respond to emerging crises situations — such as recently witnessed pandemics or energy shocks to adapt to digital transition and rapid technological change and to contribute to economic security. Intervention at EU level provides cooperation and harmonisation at EU level and offers relevant transnational and cross-border benefits and economies of scale for businesses, consumers and citizens, as well as national authorities. EU level funding is also needed to enable the Commission to fulfil its legal obligations (TFEU and related legislation) and address Single Market issues falling in its competence, as well as the Customs Union, EU taxation policy and the anti-fraud related priorities.  Funding with a focus on single market activities is essential to advance EU-wide objectives and facilitate the implementation of EU legislation across Member States. It generates an EU added value that funding at Member Stateational level could not achieve alone.  Expected generated EU added value (ex-post):  The programme’s EU added value is to enable the implementation of actions pursuing the specific objectives seeking to address the (1) knowledge and data gaps, gold plating and other barriers which are obstacles for citizens, consumers, investors and businesses, and investors to access and operate in the Single Market; (2) the need for capacity building, administrative and operational cooperation and integration among Member States and between Member States and the European Commission, which remains suboptimal; and the (3) need to ensure the effectiveness of EU rulemaking, standard-setting and enforcement at EU level.  To continue the support at EU level is essential to improve the functioning of the single market by enforcing Union law, and facilitating market access . EU action protects and empowers citizens, consumers and businesses. It helps them to adjust to the reforms and policy changes necessary for the functioning of the single market by providing information, advice tools and services.  Digital tools reduce administrative burdens and create transparency for citizens, consumers and businesses. Portals dedicated to single market topics provide information or helps businesses or citizens and consumers affected by breaches of EU law to obtain out-of-court redress, enabling them to overcome barriers. They overall help advance a paperless Single Market.  Similarly, EU coordinated platforms in different Single Market areas are needed to ensure cooperation among Member State’s authorities reducing fragmentation and duplication of efforts. These platforms enable to enhance co-operation between civil society organisations, businesses, entrepreneurs and industry bodies. Member States and the Commission can co-invest to develop key digital interoperability enablers for innovative cross-border digital public services. For instance, the structured collaboration between high level representatives from Member States through the Interoperable Europe Act 87 governance will steer public authorities’ digital transformation and cross-border interoperability.  European trans-European services and platforms enable cross-border data sharing and collaboration between national authorities, investors, businesses, and consumers , delivering benefits that individual Member States may have neither the incentive nor capacity to establish independently.  A coordinated response at the EU level avoids the risk of overlapping efforts, which would occur if Member States would independently provide information and advisory services to businesses and consumers on the single market.  Similarly, in the area of customs and taxation it has been confirmed that the EU level intervention, deployed under the current MFF via Customs including the CCEI, and Fiscalis programmes, is achieving efficiencies of scale in general and efficiency gains in IT capacity building, operational capacity building, while the collaborative activities and human competency building (including training) are providing opportunities for cooperation, communication and networking across the EU that could not be achieved without the EU level action and are essential to ensure harmonisation. Implementing common components of digital systems at EU level contributes to mitigating the challenges of national customs and tax administrations’ unequal capacities in terms of IT infrastructure and equipment availability, human resources and operational processes, uneven interpretation and implementation of relevant legislation by customs and tax administrations, and geographic, administrative, legal and strategic obstacles to cooperation. Equally so, supporting the acquisition of the customs control equipment in the enlargement countries (and for addressing crisis situations) will strengthen the Customs Union and Single Market.  The current Union Anti-Fraud Programme (UAFP) brings significant EU added value in the field of protecting the EU’s financial interests against fraud, corruption or any other irregularities, as identified by the programme’s interim evaluation. UAFP funding proved to be a vital resource helping Member States stay up to date with the latest technologies, equipment and expertise needed in their fight against fraud and other offences detrimental to the EU’s financial interests.  In the context of the EU Anti-Fraud Architecture, coordination with Member States and the Commission is essential in addressing increasingly complex cross-border fraud having an impact on the financial and other interests of the EU. Coordinated operational activity, EU-level anti-fraud intelligence and administrative tools to exchange sensitive investigative-related information including with third countries, are essential tools that strengthen the Union’s Customs Union and Single Market.  The Irregularity Management System (IMS) is the only database in the EU that consolidates reported information about irregularities, including fraud, in the shared management and pre-accession funds. It allows for various types of analyses and helps further develop an evidence-based EU anti-fraud policy. Through the analyses developed by OLAF, it also feeds into the Member States’ fraud risk assessments  Regarding the Single Market areas falling in the scope of the programme, the EU also has exclusive competence in respect of establishing and enforcing competition rules necessary for the functioning of the single market and with significant  macroeconomic impacts. Digital tools (for case work, investigations, secure exchange of information) and studies are necessary conditions for effective and efficient enforcement of competition rules. The effective enforcement of EU competition policy, which has a significant positive impact on customer savings and on the EU economy overall, requires the Commission to have the necessary expertise and digital tools to support its enforcement activities. The necessary expertise is necessary to modernise the EU's competition policy to ensure it supports European companies to innovate, compete and lead world-wide.  EU-level coordination as regards policies related to businesses , is by nature based on a cooperation between Member States and the Commission, which could not be triggered on the national level alone. These instruments should continue to address gaps in financing, stimulate growth, enhance competitiveness across the EU and contribute to harmonising such approaches across the Member States. They should also continue to ensure that the interests of consumers and investors, including the end users of financial services, are represented at the European level so that developments in the single market also respond to their needs.  The production of European standards is crucial to align standards with EU legislation. It is also important to keep ensuring stakeholder participation in international standard-setting (for example in the area of corporate financial and non-financial reporting standards involving EFRAG and the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation).  Standardisation activities allow to replace 27 national standards with a harmonised standard, setting common rules across the single market.  This harmonisation is crucial, as not all Member States share the same level of interest or are equally affected by specific policy initiatives due to diverse geographical, climate, environmental, industrial, financial and commercial factors.  Activities in market surveillance are instrumental in meeting the objectives of the   legal requirements. They aim to enhance the effectiveness of market surveillance, improve the cooperation between Member States, harmonisation of ways of working and e-commerce surveillance. Market surveillance activities avoid that the less resourceful Member States would become the weak links of the single market, via which all kind of dangerous product could enter the single market and circulate freely. This would threaten the competitiveness of EU businesses, but also consumer safety. Market surveillance includes financing joint testing of products and facilitates cross-border collaboration and sharing of expertise. EU Testing Facilities for products are an example of initiatives that demonstrates how EU-wide approach minimises duplication and creates economies of scale.  The programme should provide significant EU-added value by ensuring consumers across the EU have access to fair, effective, and cross-border dispute resolution. European Consumer Centres (ECC) Network and Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) mechanisms activities contribute to reducing legal costs, strengthening enforcement, and enhancing consumer confidence in the single market. The programme would support cross-border initiatives that national efforts alone could not achieve.  European statistics have strong EU added-value, due to their impartiality, reliability, and comprehensive coverage, as well as to their significantly improved comparability and harmonisation across EU Member States. Activities enable to align statistical data production standards, ensuring high-quality, comprehensive, and reliable statistics.  1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past  The interim evaluation of the Single Market Programme (SMP) showed that the potential for flexibility, synergies, and simplification, resulting from its integrated design, has not been fully exploited. The feasibility of initiating more joint actions was pointed out as an area of improvement, as well as the simplification of the eGrants tool.  There is a need for information evidenced during the interim evaluation of the SMP by the effectiveness and level of use of digital information tools (Your Europe, Your Europe Advice (YEA)) and services. The SMP interim evaluation showed it is crucial continue to focus on raising consumer education and awareness of consumer law, especially in countries where evidence suggests gaps, with specific emphasis on financial literacy and digital rights. Significant progress is still needed, notably for making procedures accessible to cross-border users. Communication and knowledge sharing between different stakeholders was assessed satisfactory by the interim evaluation of the SMP, nevertheless, it can be further improved.  There is also a need for continuous action to strengthen the financial literacy of citizens and raise awareness regarding aspects of the financial services that affect consumers in their day-to-day life such as the increase of digitalisation and digital finance or savings and financial planning through retail investments. This will also contribute to further the Savings and Investments Union.  There is a need to continue investing in new technologies and innovative data sources, expanding data coverage and granularity, to enhance timely European statistical production and dissemination.  In some policy areas, there is sub-optimal administrative cooperation and integration between Member States and between Member States and the European Commission that impacted consistent levels of enforcement of EU policies, law and rules. To avoid the creation of de facto barriers to free movement there is a need for reinforced operational and administrative cooperation and integration between authorities, and between the national administration and the Commission.  In the area of anti-fraud, administrative cooperation and effective anti-fraud tools to support investigation activities, as well as to prevent and detect fraud, is essential to allow Member States and OLAF, as well as third countries, to exchange sensitive operational information in a safe and timely manner to address fraud at an early stage to prevent losses to the Union budget. It is also vital to reinforce and develop the AFIS and IMS infrastructures, allowing an enhancement of the data management and data exploitation functionalities. This would increase the operational capacity of Member States investigations and data analyis in fraud prevention and detection activities.  The setting of standards necessitates support for European Standardisation Organisations (ESOs). Harmonised European standards allow economic operators to demonstrate compliance with EU law with one standard across the single market.  Capacity building for Consumer Protection Cooperation (CPC) authorities, other public authorities enforcing consumer rights and ADR bodies is required, backed by regular needs assessments to keep pace with evolving legislation. Upskilling of ADRs will be essential to tackle new categories of consumer disputes, making workshops and events for exchanging best practices essential. Enhance cooperation among Member States to address the fragmented ADR landscape across EU and promote collaboration among sector-specific ADR networks. This will help reduce administrative challenges by sharing resources, exchanging best practices.  In line with the established legal commitments at Union level, it is crucial to continue developing and operating Union components of digital solutions in the area of customs and taxation . Those common components are essential for establishing a modern and efficient Customs Union as well as tax systems across the Union and for enhancing the Union’s competitiveness at global level. The Programme should enable the continuation of the Customs programme including customs control equipment support interventions , and of the Fiscalis programme. In this respect, the p rogramme should enable the continuation of supporting the work of the customs and tax authorities not only by ensuring a solid digital customs and tax environment but also by reinforcing expert networks, the sharing of know-how and good practices, as well as by complementing the national efforts for training (human competency building) customs and tax officials and professionals with Union level solutions. In that sense, the Programme should support the continued collaboration and cooperation between the national customs authorities as well as between national tax authorities and their cooperation with the Commission and with other national authorities, and their digital, administrative, human and operational capacity building (development and operation of electronic systems and digital solutions and tools, equipment, infrastructure, training, innovation, studies, evaluations etc.). The importance of ensuring adequate and equivalent results of customs controls – amongst other aspects – calls for the availability and optimal use of relevant and state-of-the-art customs control equipment, which should be facilitated by the Programme, in particular in case of crisis situations and in the p countries neighbouring the Union’s external borders. Joint procurement should be encouraged as much as possible to achieve further efficiencies and economies of scale. In this way, the Programme should also enable the transition to a renewed Customs Union 88 .  1.5.4. Compatibility with the multiannual financial framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments  There is no significant duplication or overlap with other EU policies or programmes.  The Programme is consistent with other proposed Union action programmes and funds that pursue similar objectives in related fields of competence.  Activities under the Programme are complementary and seek synergies with several proposals such as National and Regional Partnerships, the European Competitiveness Fund, the Horizon Europe and the Global Europe Fund .  1.6. Duration of the proposal/initiative and of its financial impact   limited duration  –  in effect from 01/01/2028 to 31/12/2034,  –  financial impact from 2028 to 2034 for commitment appropriations and from 2028 to 2039 for payment appropriations.   unlimited duration  – Implementation with a start-up period from YYYY to YYYY,  – followed by full-scale operation.  1.7.

Comments  Indirect management may be used on occasion in the course of the programme, if a specific need arises and indirect management represents the most adequate way of funding, e.g. international organisations, public law bodies. In the field of customs, indirect management will be used with the involvement of the EU Customs Authority, in line with the approach established in the EU Customs reform proposal under negotiations between the co-legislators. The proposal stipulates that the Commission may entrust to the EU Customs Authority tasks for the implementation of the customs-related funding programmes such as the development, operation and maintenance of the EU Customs Data Hub and activities relating to the allocation, funding and procurement of customs control equipment, including the assessment of needs, joint procurement and co-sharing of equipment.  In the policy areas of standardisation, conformity assessment and market surveillance, the 2025 Single Market Strategy presents several actions to address structural problems and improve the governance of the Single Market  and to take effective action to increase product compliance by tapping into synergies between the EU and national customs and market surveillance authorities considering “EU level market surveillance in strategic priority areas, notably concerning e-commerce imports from third countries where measures taken by individual Member States may not be sufficient and potentially establishing an EU Market Surveillance Authority.  2. MANAGEMENT MEASURES  2.1. Monitoring and reporting rules  The monitoring and reporting rules for this programme will follow the requirements laid down in Regulation xxx [Performance Regulation].  2.2. Management and control system(s)  2.2.1. Justification of the budget implementation method(s), the funding implementation mechanism(s), the payment modalities and the control strategy proposed  The programme shall be implemented under direct management or indirect management. Part of the actions will be implemented by the Commission services with the possibility for delegation to an executive Agency and implementation by decentralised authority(ies).  Union funding may be provided in any form, in particular grants,  procurement, non-financial donations, and remuneration and reimbursements to experts . Joint procurement shall be encouraged to achieve further efficiencies and economies of scale.  All methods of funding can potentially be applied, including simplified forms of grants (lump sums, unit costs, flat rate financing) and financing not linked to costs. This ensures maximum flexibility for the duration of the Programme.  Specific rules for eligibility for funding are limited to a minimum in order to give full flexibiliy to the development of crosscutting and joint actions in the course of the programme. Specific provisions are made only where the continuation of existing funding structures with proven added value and impact requires it.  Where the programme ensures continuity of ongoing actions, the envisaged implementation methods and internal controls are identified by the Commission Services currently responsible for the activities concerned. In specific:  Activities related to competition will be implemented mainly through procurement under direct management, in particular for the financing of IT projects. This includes effective IT-governance processes, which actively involve the systems’ users.  In the field of contracts/grants awarded in the area of financial services, financial stability and capital markets union and Savings and Investments Union, the Programme will be implemented under direct management. There will be a constant link with policy work on financial services including Savings and Investments Union which, in specific fields, depends on the outputs of the contracts/grants funded under the programme. Such management mode ensures the necessary flexibility for adapting the programme to actual policy needs in an area subject to frequent changes.  The management mode for the provision and dissemination of statistics is central direct management by the Commission. From a financial point of view, the programme will be implemented by awarding contracts mainly in the domains of statistics and IT services, and via grants mainly donated to national statistical authorities. The standard payment modalities of the European Commission will be applied. A multi-annual control strategy covering the lifetime of the programme will be established in order to reduce the risks related to the financial transactions of the programme to an acceptable level taking into account its cost-efficiency. The control strategy will foresee a combination of mandatory ex ante controls with complementary ex post controls.  The part of the programme that concerns consumer policy, company law, contract law and anti-money laundering will be implemented through mainly through public procurements and grants under direct management. Direct management enables effective monitoring of programme objectives and implementation by providing greater flexibility for modifications and adjustments, including those related to evolving policy needs. Some activities under the consumer policy will be carried out through indirect management, involving cooperation with international organisations such as the OECD and UNCTAD. Actions related to consumer policy may be implemented by an Executive Agency, mainly through grants although procurement activities will also be possible.  The Single Market Strategy 2025 presents the possibility to take effective action to increase product compliance by tapping into synergies with capacities of the EU and national customs and market surveillance authorities and potentially establishing an EU Market Surveillance Authority  The Commission’s Customs Reform proposal – under negotiations between the co-legislators – stipulates that the Commission may entrust to the EU Customs Authority tasks for the implementation of the customs -related funding programmes such as the development, operation and maintenance of the EU Customs Data Hub and activities relating to the allocation, funding and procurement of customs control equipment, including the assessment of needs, joint procurement and co-sharing of equipment. Some parts of interventions will remain under direct management by the Commission, notably the management of the legacy digital systems, until they will be integrated in the EU Customs Data Hub. Under direct and indirect management, there will be grants to the national customs authorities as well as procurement, including related to human competency building activities.  Activities related to taxation will be implemented mainly through procurement under direct management, in particular for the financing of IT projects but also human competency buiding activities. This includes effective IT-governance processes, which actively involve the systems’ users.  Intervention will be complemented by grants involving national taxation authorities.  Some procurement activities will be managed directly by the Commission, as this allows to better adapt to the needs of the policy and will allow for instance to do legislative conformity checks, studies, and implement some prerogative activities of the Commission.  2.2.2. Information concerning the risks identified and the internal control system(s) set up to mitigate them  The internal control framework is built on the implementation of the Commission's Internal Control Principles, procedures for selecting the best projects and translating them into legal instruments, project and contract management throughout the project lifecycle, ex-ante checks on claims, including receipt of audit certificates, ex-ante certification of cost methodologies, ex post audits and corrections, and evaluation.  The internal control processes on the authorisation of expenditure are aimed to ensure the adequate management of the risks relating to the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions, and the nature of payments. Furthermore, the control system consists of different building blocks, such as reporting to senior management, ex-ante verification by central financial team, internal advisory committee for procurements and contracts, ex-post controls and audits from the Internal Audit Service and the European Court of Auditors.  2.2.3. Estimation and justification of the cost-effectiveness of the controls (ratio between the control costs  and the value of the related funds managed), and assessment of the expected levels of risk of error (at payment & at closure)  A cost-effective internal control system will be ensured by the responsible authorising officer. The objective for the internal control system is to maintain the expected levels of risk of error (at payment & at closure) below the materiality threshold of 2% on an annual basis.  It is estimated that the cost of controls will remain below 10%   of total expenditure and is expected to decrease .  2.3. Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities  The financial interests of the Union must be protected through proportionate measures throughout the expenditure cycle, including the prevention, detection and investigation of irregularities, the recovery of funds lost, wrongly paid or incorrectly used and, where appropriate, administrative and financial penalties. Effective anti-fraud actions require active cooperation, including knowledge-sharing and information exchange, between the relevant involved authorities at both national and EU levels. Where necessary, such cooperation may also extend to third countries.  In addition to these general measures, and given that the programme will be implemented by several Commission Directorates - General, including by executive and decentralised authorities, each entity will apply measures for the prevention of fraud and irregularities that are most suited to the policy and intervention areas under their responsibility.  The Commission maintains robust antifraud strategy, complemented by the local antifraud strategies of the Commission services that cover the activities falling under their remit. The Commission or its representatives shall have the power of audit, based on documents and on the spot, over all grant beneficiaries, contractors and subcontractors who have received Union funds. OLAF is  authorised to carry out on-the-spot checks and inspections on economic operators concerned directly or indirectly by such funding.  The Court of Auditors and the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (‘the EPPO’) and, for the processing of personal data, the European Data Protection Supervisor have the same rights as the contracting authority, particularly right of access, for the purpose of checks, audits and investigations.  The Commission also implements a series of measures such as:  - decisions, agreements and contracts resulting from the implementation of the programme will expressly entitle the Commission, including OLAF, EPPO and the Court of Auditors to conduct audits, on-the-spot checks and inspections;  - during the evaluation phase of a call for proposals/tender, the proposers and tenderers are checked against the published exclusion criteria based on declarations and the Early Detection and Exclusion System (EDES);  - the rules governing the eligibility of costs will be simplified in accordance with the provisions of the Financial Regulation.  - regular training on issues related to fraud and irregularities is given to all staff involved in contract management as well as to auditors and controllers who verify the beneficiaries' declarations on the spot.  3.

The once-only principle is respected. User identity and organisational data is collected once during registration and reused across modules. Row 7 — European statistics; Micro data, aggregated data; European statistics cover all key EU policy areas – Eurostat receives data in more than 2000 datasets and metadata sets and disseminates more than 7500 datasets, supported by the Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange (SDMX) standard. The data transmissions from the Member States to Eurostat are almost exclusively based on legal requirements laid down in the EU acquis on European statistics, as well as some voluntary data transmissions. Disseminated datasets help Eurostat deliver on its mission of providing high-quality statistics for Europe, making trust-worthy statistics widely available to users. Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 on European Statistics includes legal provisions to ensure sustainable access to new data sources for the purposes of official statistics. Such new data sources include among others: · Privately held data, such as location data from mobile network operators or web data on enterprises or on labour market trends. · Administrative data held by European or national administration These provisions are in line with the principles of the European Data Strategy , and specifically with its emphasis on facilitating use of privately-held data by government authorities and the sharing of data between public authorities. The implementation of these new provisions aims to reduce administrative burden on citizens and businesses by reducing reliance on traditional surveys and by making sure that the ‘once only’ principle is respected. The necessary regulatory, administrative, technical and organisational measures are in place for European statistics to protect the security and integrity of statistical data and their transmission, in accordance with best practices, international standards, as well as European and national legislation. Strict protocols apply to external users accessing statistical microdata for research purposes. The data sought from businesses is, as far as possible, readily available from their accounts and electronic means are used where possible to facilitate its return. Administrative and other data sources are used whenever possible to avoid duplicating requests for data. Data sharing and data integration, while adhering to confidentiality and data protection requirements, are promoted to minimise response burden. Row 8 — Competition policy; Business-related information, case-investigation information; To enforce EU competition rules, the European Commission manages ever-increasing amounts of data, sometimes involving millions of documents or even several terabytes of information in a single case.

This initiative consolidates four existing funding programs into a single, streamlined effort, focusing on improving the movement of goods, services, people, and capital across the EU. The proposal seeks to simplify access to funding, reduce administrative burdens, and enhance adaptability to unforeseen needs, particularly in today's uncertain geopolitical climate.

Key principles upheld by the program include 'do no significant harm' and gender equality, with provisions for preparedness and climate resilience. It also includes rules for monitoring and reporting on performance and supports overseas countries and territories linked to EU Member States, ensuring their eligibility for funding. The proposal emphasizes the need for more action to address barriers, stimulate reforms, and reduce fragmentation, especially in light of new global challenges.

The program has specific objectives, such as empowering citizens, consumers, investors, economic operators, and businesses by providing information, guidance, and advice to make informed decisions and fully access the opportunities of the Single Market. It aims to foster cooperation among Member States' national authorities and between these authorities, the Commission, and other Union bodies. The program will support the design, implementation, and enforcement of Union legislation underpinning the Single Market, customs, and tax policies.

A significant component of the proposal is the development and integration of European electronic systems for customs and taxation. These systems are designed"

CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  Farming and food are strategic sectors for the Union, providing safe and high-quality food to 450 million Europeans at affordable prices and playing a key role for European as well as global food security. At the same time, they are essential for sustaining the economy and life in rural areas, as well as an important part of the solution in the protection of climate, nature, soils, water, and biodiversity currently under stress. The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is at the heart of the European project and has committed more than 60 years ago to ensuring food security and a fair standard of living for the agricultural community, in line with the EU Treaties’ objectives.  Such commitment is as relevant today as it was then, as the EU agricultural sector continues to face significant challenges. Uneven global playing fields, some import dependencies and vulnerability to geopolitical uncertainties add to the long-term uncertainty faced by EU farmers. At the same time, farmers must get a better revenue from the market, enabling them to make the necessary investments for future-proof and resilient farms. For this to materialise, current imbalances in the food chain where an unfair distribution of revenues, risks and the burden of costs often disproportionately affect primary producers, must be addressed.  These challenges justify public intervention for the sector and at the same time call for a robust and adaptive policy response to ensure a competitive, resilient, and sustainable agricultural sector. In line with the Commission Communication ‘A Vision for Agriculture and Food ’ 1 , such policy response would also contribute to ensure a more attractive and predictable sector where incomes enable farmers to thrive and attract future generations. In this context, defining proper enabling conditions at EU level together with an ambitious set of tools would help farmers to leverage their entrepreneurial potential, reinforce their position in the value chain, including incentives for farmers to share risks (e.g., via producer organisations or cooperatives). At the same time, by supporting investments in training, exchange of best practices, uptake of innovative production methods and proper risk management practices at farm level, farmers are thereby supported to explore different income sources and grasp new market opportunities, such as those linked to the growing bioeconomy applications of hemp.  This is why specific support for certain sectors is considered of strategic nature to contribute to achieving the CAP objectives and to reinforce synergies with other CAP instruments. Equally important is EU support for protein crops considering the agronomic challenges and climatic vulnerability limiting the interest by farmers to engage in this sector. At the same time, this particular attention is also determined by the need to reduce the Union dependence on imports for high-quality proteins, and reinforce, in line with the Vision, the EU open strategic autonomy.  In this context and as recalled by the Vision, sustainable livestock remains an essential part of the Union’s agriculture, competitiveness and cohesion. The Union livestock sector is particularly vulnerable to various shocks and global competition, and it is required to meet high production standards that are not always rewarded by the market. Recognising the natural composition of meat and meat products, in the interest of both Union producers and consumers becomes important as meat-related terms often carry cultural significance.  In line with t he Niinistö Report on the Preparedness and Readiness of the EU 2 and in the Preparedness Union Strategy 3 , preparedness considerations should be integrated into all Union policies. This new reality has been marked by significant shocks, from the pandemic, the Russian war of aggression and market disturbances to animal and plant diseases and a volatile geopolitical situation. This is why, to ensure the delivery of EU Treaty objectives when it comes to ensuring the availability of supply, also in time of emergencies and severe crises , preparedness in the agricultural sector across Member States should be enhanced. This should be achieved by complementing national initiatives, enhancing coordination among Member States and between Member States and the Commission and improving efficiency and fostering a culture of preparedness and resilience, while fully respecting national competences and the specific circumstances of each Member State as well as the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. In particular, the Commission Communication ‘ Union Stockpiling Strategy : Boosting the EU’s material preparedness for crisis’ 4 stresses that in severe, long-term, complex, and cross-border crises, it is crucial to coordinate national measures to ensure a steady supply of essential goods and the continuation of vital societal functions .  At the same time, in line with the Vision for Agriculture and Food, reconnecting EU consumers - especially vulnerable groups such as children - with food and local territories remains essential for the future of farming in Europe. For this reason, efforts to promote the quality of EU food on European markets, including in the outermost regions, as well as on the international markets should continue. Such initiatives would enhance both the competitiveness of the agricultural sector as well as encourage healthier eating habits among the general public. In this respect, the aid for the supply of fruit and vegetables and of milk and milk products in educational establishments (‘EU school scheme’) has proven to be effective in increasing the consumption of selected agricultural products, but its effectiveness and coherence with other CAP instruments should be further strengthened.  Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council 5 sets forth the fundamental rules for the common organisation of the markets in agricultural products (CMO). For the period 2028 to 2034, financial support for measures laid down in that Regulation will be governed by the legal framework set out in Regulation (EU) …/ … of the European Parliament and of the Council [NRPF] 6 . This support will also be subject to the rules specified in Regulation (EU) .../ … of the European Parliament and of the Council [Performance Regulation] 7 , which establishes a budget expenditure tracking and performance framework along with other horizontal rules for Union program mes and activities, unless otherwise specified.  Similarly, the EU school scheme and support for specific agricultural sectors will receive financial backing through National and Regional Partnership Plans (the ‘NRP Plans’) under Regulation (EU) …./… [NRPF Regulation]. However, since these are connected to agricultural product markets, the specific rules on the type of interventions should be laid down in Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013.  In addition, in order to take into account developments in the agricultural sector and to improve the implementation of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013, certain provisions of that Regulation need to be amended and updated.  Moreover, following the repeal of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council 8 and in view of the proposals for Regulations (EU) .../... [NRPF Regulation] and (EU) .../... [Performance Regulation] , certain empowerments laid down in Regulat ion (EU) No 1306/2013 and in Regulation (EU) 2021/2116 of the European Parliament and of the Council 9 concerning public intervention , aid for private storage, tariff rate quotas , producer organisations and securities should be integrated into Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013. Furthermore, following the integration of certain provisions of Regulation (EU) No 228/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council 10 into Regulation (EU) …./ … [NRPF Regulation], some of its provisions should also be integrate d into Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 .  To align with the provisions of the WTO Agreement on Agriculture it is necessary to update certain provisions for calculation of additional import duties.  As a part of this initiative, provisions on the conditions for production and marketing of hemp products should be laid down. The existing rules on imports of hemp should also be updated for consistency.  Finally, provisions on the availability of supplies of agricultural products in time of emergencies and severe crises should be provided for in Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  This proposal is fully consistent with the CAP Treaty objectives laid out in Article 39 TFEU. The objectives of the amendments are consistent with rules on the common market organisation for agricultural products . They aim at improving the existent common market organisation.  • Consistency with other E U policies  The amendments are consistent with other EU policies and reinforce the role of the CMO rules and related instruments in contributing to the objectives of the common agricultural policy .  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  Articles 42, 43(2) and 349 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) are the basis for the proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013.  The legal basis provides for: the establishment of the common organisation of agricultural markets and other provisions that are necessary for the pursuit of the objectives of the common agricultural policy, and rules on specific measures in outermost regions.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  Under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, agriculture is a field of shared competence between the Union and the Member States, and the principle of subsidiarity therefore applies.  Given the EU-wide dimension of the common market organisation and the fact that it regulates the free movement of goods of agricultural products in the internal market, the different issues need to be addressed at EU level than at the level of the Member States acting individually. Moreover, the proposed changes are amendments of the existing common market organisation for agricultural products.  • Proportionality  The proposal comprises limited and targeted changes to the current legislation, which are necessary for the good functioning of the existent common market organisation.  • Choice of the instrument  Given the objectives and content of the proposal, an amendment to the existing regulations is the most appropriate instrument.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  The proposal is part of the review of the CAP for post-2027 for which an overall impact assessment and stakeholder consultations have been carried out.  • Fundamental rights  The proposed amendments respect the rights and observe the principles enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, as laid down in Regulations (EU) .../... [NRPF Regulation]. The provisions of Regulations (EU) .../... [NRPF Regulation] concerning the respect of fundamental rights and the rule of law will apply also to the EU school scheme and the support for agricultural sectors.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  The EU school scheme and the support for agricultural sectors will be supported by the Fund for which rules are laid down in Regulations (EU) .../... [NRPF Regulation] and (EU) .../... [Performance Regulation]. As regards the EU school scheme, Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2023/106 fixes the indicative allocations of Union aid to Member States for school fruit and vegetables and for school milk for the period from 1 August 2023 to 31 July 2029, thus it encroaches on the next multiannual financial framework (‘MFF’) period, for the years 2028 to 2034. As with the CAP post-2027 a new school scheme will be set up from 2028, a specific reduced allocation must be defined for the 5-month period, from 1 August to 31 December 2027, for school year 2027/2028, as its implementation and financing will still fall under the current MFF.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  This initiative will be monitored through the performance framework applicable for the 2028- 2034 multiannual financial framework which is set out in the proposal for a Regulation (EU) .../… [Performance Regulation], which establishes a budget expenditure tracking and performance framework along with other horizontal rules for Union programmes and activities, unless otherwise specified.  EU school scheme interventions  The legal provisions provide the basic policy parameters, such as the objectives of the scheme and its basic requirements, while Member States would bear greater responsibility as to how they meet the objectives and achieve targets. Enhanced subsidiarity makes it possible to better take into account local conditions and needs. Regulation (EU) .../... [NRPF Regulation] rules should apply to the EU school scheme while specific rules on that type of intervention should be laid down in Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013.  In order to reduce the intake of free sugars and fats by schoolchildren, the distribution of products high in free sugars and fats should be limited. In order to raise awareness of children of the variety of products that are cultivated in the Union as well as their different qualities, the distribution of products originating in the Union should be prioritised combined with criteria linked to higher environmental and social sustainability standards . Member States should ensure the implementation of awareness raising measures on certain topics. As the case may be and to avoid duplications, the national curriculum can be used instead of the scheme. In view of the increased concern over processed foods and products potentially high in added sugars, which do not meet children’s nutritional needs, those products should be excluded from the EU school scheme. Those new elements emerge from the evaluation of the scheme, as thoroughly analysed in the impact assessment.  Sectoral interventions  The legal provisions define minimum requirements concerning the contents and policy objectives for such types of intervention which have the overall aim to ensure the efficient functioning and stability of agricultural markets. This would ensure a level playing field in the internal market and lay down conditions of equal and fair competition. When including interventions in certain sectors in their NRP Plans, Member States should ensure consistency with other interventions at a sectoral level. The types of intervention in certain sectors should provide support to the fruit and vegetables, wine, protein crops, apiculture products, olive oil and table olives and hops sectors, as well as for other sectors and products listed in Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 and, for which the establishment of specific interventions is deemed to have beneficial effects on the achievement of some or all of the general and specific objectives of the CAP pursued by Regulation (EU) .../... [NRPF Regulation].  Protein crops  The legal provisions introduce specific rules for the mandatory recognition of producers and interbranch organisations in this sector. This would help to strengthen the value chain at regional, national and transnational level, and address agronomic challenges jeopardising farmers’ interest in this sector.  In order to support the production of protein crops and reduce the Union dependence on imports for high-quality proteins, a distinct protein crop sector should be created in Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013. For that purpose, the protein crop sector will replace the current dried fodder sector. Products belonging to the protein crop sector will be moved from Part XXIV of Annex I to a new Section 1 in Part IV of Annex I, to Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013. Dried fodders which are not protein crops will be moved from the current Part IV of Annex I to Part XXIV of that Annex. The reference to the dried fodder sector should be removed from Article 6 on marketing years.  Transitional provisions should be added in Articles 154 and 158 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 for the recognition of existing producer organisations (POs) and interbranch organisations (IBOs) already recognised for products that fall under the new protein crop sector.  The protein crop sector should be added to the list of sectors for which Member States are obliged to recognise, on request, producer organisations and interbranch organisations (Article 159, points (a) and (b), respectively of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013).  Marketing standards  In line with the conclusions of the Commission report on new marketing standards for dried leguminous vegetables and soya bean 11 , it is appropriate to provide for the possibility to lay down marketing standards for protein crop s to better inform consumers about the origin of the protein crops products they purchase. For the same reason, beef, pigmeat, sheep and goat me a t should be added to the list for which marketing standards can be adopted. In addition, with the objective of possibly harmonising the definition and composition of certain cheeses to ensure a common basis for quality across the internal market, it is also appropriate to provide for the possibility to lay down marketing standards for cheese.  Hemp  Hemp falls under the CMO of the CAP, with Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 expanding its scope beyond fibre use. Farmers can receive area-based CAP payments if they meet standard and hemp-specific criteria, including growing varieties with Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (‘THC’) content below 0,3 % to prevent illicit crop cultivation.  The European Court of Justice 12 ruled that cannabidiol ( ‘ CBD ’ ) from the whole Cannabis Sativa plant is not a drug under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. However, inconsistencies among Member States' regulations limit full plant utili s ation and economic potential, especially concerning flowering tops. These discrepancies can hinder farmers from accessing CAP support or marketing hemp products across Member States.  To address this, Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 will include rules on hemp production and marketing. Article 189 will be amended, and Annex I, Part VIII will be expanded to encompass all hemp plant parts as agricultural products, provided CAP requirements are met. This aims to align with the EU hemp market's growth, offering legal certainty to farmers.  New legal provisions will also uphold public health protection, keeping strict seed certification and a 0,3 % THC limit, ensuring compliance with international drug conventions. Scientific evidence supports low health risk from hemp varieties with up to 0,3 % THC. To harmonise Annex I, Part VIII, changes will also apply to linseed, moving relevant products from Annex I, Part XXIV, Section 1.  Transitional provisions will protect existing producer organisations and allow farmers to market hemp sown before new rules apply. With a deferred application, stakeholders will have time to adjust to the new regulatory framework.  Sugar  Article 125 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 requires that the terms for buying sugar beet and sugar cane are to be governed by written agreements within the trade, as described in Part II, Section A, point 6, of Annex II to that Regulation. Article 125(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 requires the agreements within the trade to conform to the purchase terms laid down in Annex X to that Regulation. Those provisions should be amended for the sake of clarity and consistency as regards the parties to the agreements within the trade and as regards the products concerned by those agreements and subject to purchase terms.  Furthermore, in order to enhance legal clarity and reinforce the protection of the rights of beet sellers in contractual relationships with sugar undertakings, it is necessary to amend point VIII of Annex X to Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 to explicitly provide that the ownership of the beet pulp remains with the beet seller unless otherwise agreed.  To give stakeholders from the sugar sector sufficient time to adapt, the application of the changes concerning the agreements within the trade should be deferred until 1 October after the year of entry into force of the Regulation.  Additional import duties  Article 182(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 lays down rules for the calculation method that may be used to fix the tigger volume for the purpose of the application of additional import duties. In order to correctly reflect the calculation method set out in Article 5(4) of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Agriculture, Article 182(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 should be amended to specify that the calculation should be based on the average yearly imports in the three preceding years. Furthermore, Article 182(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 provides that additional duties are not to be imposed where imports are unlikely to disturb the Union market, or where effects would be disproportionate to the intended objective. However, demonstrating that imports are likely to disturb the Union market is difficult and, in case of perishable seasonal products, where such safeguard currently applies, often unfeasible or not sufficiently timely. Since this requirement goes beyond obligations set out in the WTO Agreement on Agriculture, and in order to address stakeholders’ concerns and simplify the procedure, the referred paragraph 2 should be deleted.  Rules on the availability of supplies in time of emergencies and severe crisis  Legal provisions introduce obligations for Member States to adopt baseline preparedness measures that should include the establishment of national and/or regional preparedness and response plans concerning agricultural products, regular sharing of information on stocks of agricultural products, the designation of competent authorities and participation in EU-level stress testing exercises. These efforts should be complemented by enhanced obligations during crises or high-risk situations, including mandatory reporting.  The Union Stockpiling strategy aims to combine centralised reserves with contributions from Member States, supported by public-private partnerships to ensure efficiency, scalability and cost-effectiveness. Where Member States establish and manage reserves of agricultural products, rules should be introduced to ensure that such measures are designed in a manner that minimises market distortions.  Meat designations  Specific legal provisions should be introduced to protect meat-related terms in order to enhance transparency in the internal market as regards food composition and nutritional content and ensure that consumers can make well-informed choices, particularly for those seeking a specific nutritional content that is traditionally associated with meat products.  POSEI  In view of the proposals for Regulations (EU) .../... [NRPF Regulation] and (EU) .../... [Performance Regulation], provisions laid down in Regulation (EU) No 228/2013 concerning the use of a logo for the marketing of quality agricultural products in the outermost regions and the State aid derogation for national payments for the sugar sector in the French outermost regions should be integrated into Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013.  Reinsert missing rules and empowerments  Rules as well as empowerments relevant for measures provided for by Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 were laid down in Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 and are currently laid down in Regulation (EU) 2021/2116. Following the repeal of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 and in view of the proposals for Regulations (EU) .../... [NRPF Regulation] and (EU) .../... [Performance Regulation], rules and empowerments laid down in Regulation (EU) 2021/2116 concerning public intervention and aid for private storage, tariff quotas, recognition of producer organisations and securities should be integrated into Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013.  Deferred application and transitional rules  In order to allow Member States and operators sufficient time to comply with the new rules, the date of application should be postponed for amendments related to agreements within the trade for the sugar sector, conditions for the marketing, production and imports of hemp, and the provisions on the availability of supplies in time of emergencies and severe crisis. Furthermore, in order to ensure a smooth transition to the new EU school scheme, the deletion of the provisions relating to the EU school scheme laid down Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 should apply from 1 January 2028, but should continue to apply in respect of measures implemented until 31 December 2027. Moreover, as the current EU school scheme will be discontinued on 31 December 2028, a specific reduced allocation must be defined for the 5-month period, from 1 August to 31 December 2027, for school year 2027/2028, as its implementation and financing will still fall under the current MFF.  2025/0237 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 as regards the school fruit, vegetables and milk scheme (‘EU school scheme’), sectoral interventions, the creation of a protein sector, requirements for hemp, the possibility for marketing standards for cheese, protein crops and meat, application of additional import duties, rules on the availability of supplies in time of emergencies and severe crisis and securities  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 42, Article 43(2) and Article 349 thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 13 ,  Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions 14 ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) The Commission Communication of 19 February 2025 entitled ‘A V ision for Agriculture and Food’ 15 announces that the c ommon a gricultural p olicy (CAP) post-2027 will provide for further responsibility and accountability for Member States on how they meet the CAP objectives, supporting and stabilising farmers’ incomes and attracting a future generation of farmers, and guaranteeing food security. It should be a simpler and more targeted policy with more flexibility for farmers and a shift from requirements to incentives for farmers.  (2) The m ultiannual f inancial f ramework for the years 2028 to 2034 legislative package includes Regulation (EU) .../... of the European Parliament and of the Council [NRPF Regulation] 16 establishing the National and Regional Partnership Fund (the ‘Fund’) for the period 2028 to 2034, grouping the nationally pre-allocated funds under the Fund, including the European Agriculture Guarantee Fund (EAGF) and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD). In accordance with that Regulation t he Fund is to be implemented through National and Regional Partnership Plans (the ‘NRP Plans’) and the EU Facility (the ‘Facility’).  (3) Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council 17 provides for all basic elements of the common organisation of the markets in agricultural products.  (4) The CAP support provided for in Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 for the period post-2027 will be supported by the Fund and subject to the rules laid down in Regulation s (EU) .../... [NRPF Regulation] and (EU) .../... of the European Parliament and of the Council [Performance Regulation] 18 , as complemented by Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 .  (5) The production of protein crops in the Union faces persistent difficulties, due in particular to volatile supply and demand at local level and the agronomic challenges of their cultivation, which make them a higher-risk option for farmers. In order to support their production and reduce the Union dependence on imports for high-quality proteins, it is appropriate to create a distinct protein crop sector in Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013. Furthermore, in order to facilitate the setting up of producer and interbranch organisations in the protein crop sector, and thereby strengthen the value chain at regional, national and transitional level, its recognition should be made mandatory. As the main products of the dried fodder sector listed in Part IV of Annex I to that Regulation should be included in the protein sector, the dried fodder sector should be removed from Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 .  (6) By its judgment of 7 September 2016 in Case C-113/14 19 , the Court of Justice of the European Union (‘the Court’) annulled Article 7 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 determining the reference thresholds for agricultural products on the grounds that those thresholds should have been adopted by the Council only, on a proposal from the Commission, on the basis of Article 43(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). It is therefore appropriate to delete Article 7 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013.  (7) Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 lays down rules for public intervention. Regulation (EU) 2021/2116 laid down rules for public intervention expenditure and empowered the Commission to supplement that Regulation with rules on the type of measures eligible for Union financing and the reimbursement conditions, the eligibility conditions and calculation methods based on the information actually observed by the paying agencies, on flat rates determined by the Commission, or on flat-rate or non-flat-rate amounts provided for by the agricultural legislation in specific sectors, the valuation of operations in connection with public intervention, the measures to be taken in the case of loss or deterioration of products under the public intervention, and the determination of the amounts to be financed. Since these rules are necessary for the functioning of the system of public intervention, the existing empowerments should be integrated in Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 .  (8) In addition to the rules on public intervention, Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 lays down rules on aid for private storage. Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1238 20 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/1240 21 lay down rules on checks and penalties adopted pursuant to empowerments for delegated and implementing acts laid down in Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council 22 . Following the repeal of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 and in view of Regulations (EU) .../... [NRPF Regulation] and (EU) .../... [Performance Regulation], the empowerments laid down in Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 and in Regulation (EU) 2021 /2116 of the European Parliament and of the Council 23 to adopt delegated and implementing acts concerning checks and penalties related to public intervention and aid for private storage should be integrated into Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013.  (9) In particular, the Commission should be empowered to adopt delegated acts to supplement Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 with rules on reduction of payment of aid in case operators do not comply with their obligations relating to the conditions for public intervention or for private storage. The Commission should also be empowered to adopt, by way of implementing acts, uniform rules for Member States for the tests and methods to be applied in order to establish the eligibility of products for public intervention and private storage and the use of tendering procedures for public interventions or for private storage, on administrative and on-the-spot checks to be conducted by Member States with regard to the respect of obligations, commitments and eligibility criteria for public intervention or for private storage as well as on the application and calculation of administrative penalties by Member States when operators do not comply with the eligibility criteria, commitments or other obligations relating to the conditions for public intervention or for private storage.  (10) The aid for the supply of fruit and vegetables and of milk and milk products in educational establishments laid down in Part II , Title I, Chapter II, of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 (‘EU school scheme’) has proven to be effective in increasing the consumption of selected agricultural products. In order to contribute to achieving the CAP objectives, the EU s chool s cheme should be continued. However, in order to increase its effectiveness and to ensure coherence with other CAP instruments, the EU s chool s cheme should be based on delivery of performance and should be implemented as a type of intervention supported by the Fund . The Union should set the basic policy parameters, such as the objectives of the EU school scheme and its basic requirements, while Member States should bear greater responsibility as to how they meet the objectives and achieve targets. Enhanced subsidiarity makes it possible to better take into account local conditions and needs. Rules laid down in Regulation s (EU) .../... [NRPF Regulation] and (EU) …/… [Performance Regulation] should apply to the EU s chool s cheme , as complemented by this Regulation . T he EU s chool s cheme being a market intervention measure, the specific rules on the type of intervention should be laid down in Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013.  (11) The objective of the EU school scheme is to reconnect children with agriculture and increase healthy eating habits. As children from vulnerable groups are more prone to have unhealthy diets, Member States should be given the possibility to focus on these groups according to socio-economic considerations. In order to reduce the intake of free sugars and fats by schoolchildren, the distribution of products high in free sugars and fats should be limited. In order to raise awareness of children of the variety of products that are cultivated in the Union as well as their different qualities, the distribution of products originating in the Union should be prioritised combined with criteria linked to higher environmental and social sustainability standards. Member States sh ould ensure the implementation of awareness raising measures on certain topics. T o avoid duplicates, the national curriculum can be used instead of the EU school scheme. In view of the increased concern over processed foods and products potentially high in added sugars, which do not meet children’s nutritional needs, it is appropriate to exclude those products from the EU school scheme.  (12) Considering that the EU school scheme implemented under the Fund is to cover the period from 1 January 2028 to 31 December 2034, the deletion of the provisions relating to the EU s chool s cheme laid down in Part II, Title I, Chapter II, of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 should apply from 1 January 2028 . In order to ensure a smooth transition, it should be provided that the deleted provisions continue to apply in respect of measures implemented until 31 December 2027. Furthermore, considering that the EU school scheme laid down in Part II, Title I, Chapter II, of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 will therefore be discontinued before the end of school year 2027/2028 , which runs from 1 August 2027 until 31 July 2028, the overall limit of Union aid laid down per school year in Article 23a of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013, should be proportionally reduced for that school year .  (13) Types of intervention in certain sectors are needed to contribute to achieving the CAP objectives and reinforce synergies with other CAP instruments. Minimum requirements concerning the contents and objectives for such types of intervention should be established at Union level in order to ensure a level playing field in the internal market and avoid conditions of unequal and unfair competition. When including interventions in certain sectors in their NRP Plans, Member States should ensure consistency with other interventions at sector level. The types of intervention in certain sectors should provide support to the fruit and vegetables, wine, protein crops, apiculture products, olive oil and table olives and hops sectors, as well as for other sectors and products listed in Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013. In particular, given the Union’s deficit on plant protein and the environmental benefits their production brings, legumes should be included among the products eligible for support while respecting the EU WTO schedule on oilseeds.  (14) In order to protect the financial interests of the Union’s budget , and ensure that penalties are proportionate, effective and dissuasive, the Commission should be empowered to adopt delegated acts to supplement Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 with rules on the suspension, reduction and recovery for payments of aid for sectoral interventions in case of non-respect of the recognition criteria by the producer organisations. In addition, the Commission should be empowered to adopt, by way of implementing acts, rules on administrative and on-the-spot checks to be conducted by Member States on producer organisations or associations of producer organisations to verify compliance with the recognition criteria, as well as rules on a unique identification system of recognised producer organisations and associations of producer organisations.  (15) In line with the conclusions of the Commission report on new marketing standards for dried leguminous vegetables and soya bean 24 , i t is appropriate to provide for the possibility to lay down marketing standards for protein crops to better inform consumers about the origin of the protein crops products they purchase. For the same reason, beef, pigmeat, sheep and goat meet should be added to the list for which marketing standards may be adopted. In addition, with the objective of possibly harmonising the definition and composition of certain cheese s to ensure a common basis for quality across the internal market, it is also appropriate to provide for the possibility to lay down marketing standards for cheese.  (16) The Commission Communication ‘A Vision for Agriculture and Food’ recalls livestock is an essential part of the Union’s agriculture, competitiveness and cohesion. Sustainable livestock systems are essential for the Union economy, the viability of rural areas and the preservation of the environment and rural landscapes. The Union livestock sector is particularly vulnerable to various shocks and global competition and it is required to meet high production standards that are not always rewarded by the market. In this context, it is necessary to acknowledge the natural composition of meat and meat products, in the interest of both Union producers and consumers. Meat-related terms often carry cultural and historical significance. It is therefore appropriate to protect meat-related terms to enhance transparency in the internal market as regards the food composition and nutritional content and ensure that consumers can make well-informed choices, particularly for those seeking a specific nutritional content that is traditionally associated with meat products.  (17) Regulation (EU) No 228/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council 25 introduced a logo to encourage farmers in the outermost regions to continue to supply high-quality products and to promote their marketing. In view of Regulations (EU) .../... [NRPF Regulation] and (EU) .../... [Performance Regulation], provisions laid down in Regulation (EU) No 228/2013 concerning the use of the logo should be integrated into Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 and apply from 1 January 2028 .  (18) Article 125(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 requires that the terms for buying sugar beet and sugar cane are to be governed by written agreements within the trade, as described in Part II , Section A, point 6, of Annex II to that Regulation. Article 125(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 requires the agreements within the trade to conform to the purchase terms laid down in Annex X to that Regulation. For the sake of clarity, Article 125, Part II , Section A, points 5 and 6, of Annex II, and Annex X to Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 should be amended to ensure consistency between those provisions as regards the parties to the agreements within the trade and as regards the products concerned by those agreements and subject to purchase terms. In particular, it should be clarified that the rules on sugar agreements and purchase terms apply not only to sugar beet but also to sugar cane.  (19) Innovation and the growth of the bioeconomy have led to new applications for hemp biomass derived from all parts of the plant. This provides farmers with additional opportunities to valorise the plant beyond fibre production, making hemp a more attractive and competitive crop. In addition, growing hemp has environmental and climate benefits as it does not require pesticides or fertilisers and improves soil structure . Several hemp products, including raw hemp (CN 5302), hemp seeds (CN 1207 99 91) and other hemp parts (CN 1211 90 86) are listed as agricultural products in Annex I to the T FEU . In the interest of clarity, the products covered by the flax and hemp sector listed in Annex I, Part VIII, to Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 should be amended to include hemp products other than raw hemp.  (20) Some Member States have adopted national measures, on grounds of health protection, that prohibit the production or marketing of specific hemp products. These divergent national approaches undermine the proper functioning of the common market organisation, create legal uncertainty and barriers in the internal market and cause unfair competition between farmers in different Member States .  (21) In compliance with various international instruments which the Member States have cooperated on or acceded to, as the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 and the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971, the marketing of narcotic drugs should be prohibited , w ith the exception of strictly controlled trade or use for medical and scientific purposes. However, it follows from the reasoning of the Court in Case C - 663/18 26 that non-psychoactive products as cannabidiol derived from hemp varieties with a low Δ9- tetrahydrocannabinol content are not to be considered narcotic drugs under these conventions.  (22) Scientific evidence also suggests that hemp products obtained from varieties containing a maximum tetrahydrocannabinol content of 0.3 % are unlikely to pose a risk to human health. Therefore, to ensure legal certainty, promote the development of the sector, guarantee a level playing field across the Union and support the proper functioning of the common market organisation, while protecting public health interests, it is necessary to lay down harmonised rules at Union level for the production and marketing of hemp agricultural products that provide public health safeguards. In particular, these rules should include a uniform maximum limit of tetrahydrocannabinol content, as well as other appropriate safeguards.  (23) Furthermore, i t is also appropriate to amend Article 189 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 that lays down rules on the imports of hemp in order to ensure consistency with the new Union rules on the marketing of hemp products.  (24) In order to ensure legal certainty and to avoid disproportionate disruption for farmers , transitional arrangements should be put in place for the placing on the market of hemp products derived from hemp plants sown before the date of application of the new marketing conditions. Those products should be allowed to continue to be marketed subject to the rules in force prior to that date and only until [31 December of the year after the entry into force of th is amending Regulation]. After that date, all hemp products should comply with the new marketing conditions .  (25) In order to ensure a smooth transition following the creation of the protein crop sector, and to provide legal certainty and continuity for recognised producer or interbranch organisations, it is appropriate to provide that producer or interbranch organisations already recognised before [date of entry into force of this amending Regulation] for products that fall under the new protein crop sector should be deemed to be recognised in that sector. Such producer organisations should also retain their recognition for other products listed under other sectors. However, in cases where they no longer meet the relevant conditions for recognition in one or more sectors, Member States should withdraw the corresponding recognition no later than [31 December 20XX at least 2 full years after the date of entry into force of this amending Regulation].  (26) In order to ensure a smooth transition following the amendment of the products listed in the flax and hemp sector in Point VIII of Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013, and to provide legal certainty and continuity for recognised producer or interbranch organisations, it is appropriate to provide that producer or interbranch organisations already recognised before [date of entry into force of this amending Regulation] for products that fall under the amended flax and hemp sector should be deemed to be recognised in that sector. Such producer organisations should also retain their recognition for other products listed under other sectors. However, in cases where they no longer meet the relevant conditions for recognition in one or more sectors, Member States should withdraw the corresponding recognition no later than [31 December 20XX at least 2 full years after the date of entry into force of this amending Regulation].  (27) Article 182(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 lays down rules for the calculation method that may be used to fix the tigger volume for the purpose of the application of additional import duties. In order to correctly reflect the calculation method set out in Article 5(4) of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Agriculture, Article 182(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 should be amended to specify that the calculation should be based on the average yearly imports in the three preceding years. Furthermore, Article 182(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 provides that additional duties are not to be imposed where the imports are unlikely to disturb the Union market, or where the effects would be disproportionate to the intended objective. However, demonstrating that imports are likely to disturb the Union market is difficult and, in case of perishable seasonal products, where such safeguard currently applies, often unfeasible or not sufficiently timely. Since this requirement goes beyond the obligations set out in the WTO Agreement on Agriculture, and in order to address the stakeholders’ concerns and simplify the procedure, that paragraph 2 should be deleted.  (28) Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 lays down rules on the management of tariff quotas. Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/760 27 lays down rules on penalties for operators for cases of non-compliance with the conditions and eligibility requirements that an operator has to fulfil to submit an application within the tariff quota, that were adopted pursuant to an empowerment for the adoption of delegated acts laid down in Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013. Following the repeal of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013, the empowerment to adopt delegated acts in this respect should be integrated in Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013.  (29) Article 214a of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 allows Finland to grant, under certain conditions, national aid in Southern Finland until 2027, subject to the authorisation of the Commission. In view of the specificities of Finnish agriculture, the granting of that national aid should continue to be allowed for the period 2028 to 2034.  (30) Regulation (EU) No 228/2013 granted a state aid derogation for national payments for the sugar sector in the French outermost regions in order to mitigate the specific constraints on sugar farming in those regions linked to their extreme remoteness, specifically their isolation, insularity, small surface areas, mountainous terrain and climate and their economic dependency on sugar production. In view of Regulations (EU) .../... [NRPF Regulation] and (EU) .../... [Performance Regulation], provisions laid down in Regulation (EU) 228/2013 granting that derogation should be integrated into Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 and apply from 1 January 2028 .  (31) As underlined in the Joint Communication on the European Preparedness Union Strategy 28 , the Union should strengthen its preparedness in response to growing risks and deep uncertainty, with the objective of establishing a secure and resilient Union equipped with the capacities to anticipate, respond to and manage threats and hazards, regardless of their nature or origin. Preparedness considerations should be integrated into all Union policies. The Commission Communication ‘ EU stockpiling strategy: Boosting the EU's material preparedness for crises ’ 29 stressed that in severe, long-term, complex, and cross-border crises, it is crucial to coordinate national measures to ensure a steady supply of essential goods and the continuation of vital societal functions.  (32) To ensure the availability of supply, set out as one of the objectives of the CAP in the TFEU, also in time of emergencies and severe crises, preparedness in the agricultural sector should be enhanced. This should be achieved by complementing national initiatives, enhancing coordination among Member States and between Member States and the Commission and improving efficiency and fostering a culture of preparedness and resilience, while fully respecting the national competences and the specific circumstances of each Member State and the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.  (33) Member States should therefore be required to adopt baseline preparedness measures that should include the establishment of national and/or regional preparedness and response plans concerning agricultural products, regular sharing of information on stocks of agricultural products, the designation of competent authorities and participation in Union -level stress testing exercises. Where Member States establish and manage reserves of agricultural products, they should be implemented as part of their national and/or regional preparedness and response plans and should be designed in a manner that minimises market distortions. Those preparedness efforts should be complemented by enhanced obligations during crises or high-risk situations, including mandatory reporting.  (34) In order to ensure the uniform conditions for the implementation of the provisions concerning the availability of supplies in time of emergencies and severe crises, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission as regards reporting requirements concerning the food security preparedness and response plans, cross-border cooperation in the framework of development and application of the food security preparedness and response plans , coordinated actions for the establishment and management of reserves, such as the identification of categories of products for the establishment of the reserves and the development of joint risk assessments and early warning mechanisms to mitigate cross-border supply risks and ensure continuity of supply during disruptions, voluntary solidarity and mutual assistance mechanisms by which Member States make parts of their reserves available to another Member State facing severe shortages, real-time reporting on stocks and other relevant information as well as technical and procedural requirements for the secure handling and exchange of information. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council 30 .  (35) Various provisions of agricultural legislation require that security be lodged to ensure the payment of a sum due if an obligation is not met. This is in particular the case for the management of tariff quota s and of public intervention and private storage. In view of Regulations (EU) .../... [NRPF Regulation] and (EU) .../... [Performance Regulation], provisions laid down in Regulation (EU) 2021/2116 concerning securities should be integrated in to Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013. The empowerments to adopt delegated and implementing acts concerning securities should also be maintained and therefore integrated into Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013.  (36) In particular, in order to ensure non-discriminatory treatment, equity and the respect of proportionality when lodging a security, that delegation of power should cover rules on securities specifying the responsible party in the event that an obligation is not met, laying down the specific situations in which the competent authority may waive the requirement of a security, the conditions applicable to the security to be lodged and the guarantor, the conditions for lodging and releasing that security, the specific conditions related to the security lodged in connection with advance payments, and setting out the consequences of breaching the obligations for which a security has been lodged. Furthermore, the implementing powers of the Commission should cover the form of the securities to be lodged and the procedure for lodging the securities, for accepting them, and for replacing the original securities; the procedures for the release of securities; and the notification to be made by Member States or by the Commission in the context of securities.  (37) Regulation (EU) .../... [NRPF Regulation] provides that as regards expenditure for public intervention, the Commission has in certain cases to fix the uniform standard amounts for material operations arising from storage and, where appropriate, for the processing of the products eligible for public intervention referred in Article 11 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/201 3 . The relevant implementing acts are to be adopted in accordance with the advisory procedure laid down in Regulation (EU) No 182/2011. For the adoption of these implementing acts the Commission should be assisted by the Committee for the Common Organisation of the Agricultural markets established by Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013. Since that Regulation does not contain any reference to the advisory procedure of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011, a reference to th at procedure should be inserted in Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013.  (38) Section B, point IV, of Annex IV to Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 lays down that the grading methods to assess the lean-meat content for the purposes of the Union scale for the classification of pig carcasses are to be authorised by the Commission. Considering that the pig grading methods to assess the lean-meat content are authorised per Member State, f or the sake of simplicity and reduction of administrative burden, the grading methods should be authorised by Member States instead of the Commission.  (39) Point VIII of Annex X to Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 provides that delivery contracts between beet sellers and sugar undertaking are to set out the arrangements for the return or compensation of beet pulp. In order to ensure greater legal clarity and reinforce the protection of the rights of beet sellers, it is appropriate to amend Annex X to that Regulation to explicitly provide that the beet pulp obtained from the beet delivered remains the property of the beet seller unless otherwise agreed. To ensure transparency and balanced contractual relations, delivery contracts should explicitly stipulate the arrangements for the return, retention or processing of the pulp, including, where applicable, the quantities concerned, the sharing of pressing or drying costs, and the price or calculation method for any compensation due.  (40) Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 should therefore be amended accordingly.  (41) In order to give stakeholders sufficient time to adapt to the changes, the amendments related to agreements within the trade for the sugar sector should apply from [1 October of the year after the date of entry into force of this Regulation].  (42) In order to give stakeholders sufficient time to adapt, the rules on the conditions for the marketing , production and imports of hemp should apply from [1 January after the date of entry into force of this Regulation ] and the rules on meat-related terms should apply from [12 months after the date of entry into force of this Regulation] .  (43) In order to give Member States time to start implementing the provisions on the availability of supplies in time of emergencies and severe crises, these provisions should apply from [12 months after the date of entry into force of this Regulation] ,  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Article 1  Amendments to Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013  Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 is amended as follows:  (1) in Article 1 (2) , point (d) is replaced by the following:  ‘(d) protein crop sector, Part IV’;  (2) Article 2 is replaced by the following:  ‘Article 2  General common agricultural policy (CAP) provisions  Regulation (EU) .../... of the European Parliament and of the Council [NRPF Regulation]* and Regulation (EU) …/… of the European Parliament and of the Council [Performance Regulation]** and the provisions adopted pursuant to them shall apply in relation to the measures laid down in this Regulation.  ___________  * Regulation (EU) .../... of the European Parliament and of the Council [NRPF Regulation] (OJ L …, ELI: ).  ** Regulation (EU) .../... of the European Parliament and of the Council [Performance Regulation] (OJ L …, ELI: ).’;  (3) Article 3 is amended as follows:  (a) paragraph 3 is deleted ;  (b) in paragraph 5, the following point is added:  ‘(c) “outermost regions” means the regions referred to in Article 349 TFEU.’;  (4) in Article 6, point (b) is replaced by the following:  ‘(b) 1 April to 31 March of the following year for the silkworm sector;’;  (5) Article 7 is deleted;  (6) the references to ‘Article 229(2) or (3)’ in Articles 13(1)(c), 13(2), 21, second subparagraph, 116, 149(6), second subparagraph, 152(1c), second subparagraph, 175, second subparagraph, 179, second subparagraph, 183, second subparagraph, 193a(2), 213 and 216(2), should be replaced by ‘Article 229(2), (3) or (4)’;  (7) in Part II, Title I, Chapter I, Section 2, the following Article is added:  ‘Article 16a  Public intervention expenditure  The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 227 supplementing this Regulation with rules on:  (a) the type of measures eligible for Union financing and the reimbursement conditions;  (b) the eligibility conditions and calculation methods based on the information actually observed by the paying agencies, on flat rates determined by the Commission, or on flat-rate or non-flat-rate amounts provided for by the agricultural legislation in specific sectors;  (c) the valuation of operations in connection with public intervention, the measures to be taken in the case of loss or deterioration of products under the public intervention, and the determination of the amounts to be financed. ’;  (8) in Article 19(5), the following point is added:  ‘(d) laying down the rules on payment of aid and identifying cases where no aid is paid or the aid is reduced in case operators do not comply with their obligations relating to the conditions for public intervention or for private storage as referred to in Sections 2 and 3.’;  (9) i n Article 20, first subparagraph, the following points are added :  ‘(v) rules necessary for the tests and methods to be applied in order to establish the eligibility of products for public intervention and private storage and the use of tendering procedures for public interventions or for private storage;  (w) rules on administrative and on-the-spot checks to be conducted by Member States with regard to the respect of obligations, commitments and eligibility criteria for public intervention or for private storage as referred to in Sections 2 and 3;  (x) detailed rules for the application and calculation of administrative penalties by Member States when operators do not comply with the eligibility criteria, commitments or other obligations relating to the conditions for public intervention or for private storage as referred to in Sections 2 and 3.’;  (10) in Part II, Title I, Chapter II is deleted ;  (11) in Article 23a , the following paragraph is inserted:  ‘1a.

Article 32  Beneficiaries  1. Member States shall establish in their NRP Plans which operators may benefit from interventions in the sectors referred to in Article 30(1).  2. In their NRP Plans, Member States shall establish that producer organisations and association of producer organisations recognised under this Regulation and producer groups as referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article are the sole beneficiaries of the interventions referred to in Article 30(2).  3. Member States may decide that producer groups and entities representing other form of cooperation between producers that are constituted at the initiative of producers and controlled by them, may be beneficiaries of the interventions in the sectors referred to in Article 30(1). Such forms of cooperation shall be identified by the competent authority of a Member State as producer groups for the duration of their first operational programme. An operational programme and a recognition plan with a view to be recognised as producer organisations in accordance with the requirements laid down in Articles 152, 153, 154, 156 or 161 prepared by those producer groups shall be submitted to the competent authorities simultaneously.

Article 34  Value of marketed production  1. Member States shall indicate in their NRP Plans how the value of marketed production is calculated for each sector.  2. The value of the marketed production for a producer organisation, association of producer organisations or producer group shall be calculated on the basis of the production of the producer organisation or producer group or association of producer organisations and its producer members that has been put on the market by this organisation, association or producer group and shall only include the production of those products for which the producer organisation, association or producer group is recognised or identified.  In addition, the value of marketed production shall be calculated at fresh stage or at the first processing stage on which the product is normally marketed, in bulk, where products are allowed to be marketed in bulk. It shall be further calculated at the ‘ex-organisation, association or producer group’ stage or at ‘ex-subsidiary’ stage, provided that at least 90 % of the shares or capital of the subsidiary is owned by the producer organisation, association or producer group.  The value of marketed production shall include the value of the by-products, of market withdrawals for free distribution, of outsourced activities or of the insurance indemnification received in respect of harvest and production insurance actions.  Cost of processing in case of processed products, VAT and costs of transport internal to the organisation or producer group for distance exceeding 300 km shall not be included in the calculation of the value of marketed production.  Doubled counting of the values of marketed production shall be prohibited. In order to avoid double counting of values of marketed production, the production of the members of a producer organisation, association of producer organisations or producer group which is marketed by another such organisation shall only be counted in the value of the marketed production of the latter organisation.  3. Member States shall determine a 12-month calendar reference period during the three years prior to the year for which the aid is requested.  Where historical data on marketed production for newly recognised producer organisations, association or producer group is insufficient for the purposes of the first subparagraph, Member States shall accept the value of marketed production communicated by the producer organisation, association or group for the purpose of its recognition.  4. Where for a product a reduction of at least 35 % in the value of marketed production for a given year in relation to the average of the three previous 12-month reference periods has occurred due to natural disasters, climatic events, plant diseases or pest infestations or any other reasons falling outside the responsibility and control of the organisation, association or group, the value of marketed production of that product shall be deemed to represent 85 % of the average value in the three previous 12-month reference periods. If preventive measures were undertaken, the value of marketed production of that product shall be deemed to represent 100 % of the average value in the three previous 12-month reference periods.

These changes are designed to enhance the strategic role of farming and food production, ensuring food security for 450 million Europeans, supporting rural economies, and promoting environmental sustainability. The proposal addresses challenges such as global competition, import dependencies, and geopolitical uncertainties that impact EU farmers.

Key elements of the proposal include enhancing the EU school scheme for fruit, vegetables, and milk, and introducing sectoral interventions to support specific agricultural sectors like protein crops and hemp. A new protein crop sector is proposed to reduce reliance on imports and promote sustainable livestock farming, crucial for the EU's agricultural competitiveness and cohesion. The proposal also emphasizes preparedness in the agricultural sector to ensure supply availability during emergencies and crises, advocating for better coordination among EU Member States and the Commission.

To address supply chain vulnerabilities, the proposal introduces legal provisions requiring Member States to adopt baseline preparedness measures, including the establishment of national and/or regional preparedness and response plans for agricultural products. This includes regular sharing of information on stocks, designation of competent authorities, and participation in EU-level stress testing exercises. Enhanced obligations during crises or high-risk situations, such as mandatory reporting, are also proposed. The Union Stockpiling strategy aims to combine centralized reserves with contributions from Member States, supported by public-private partnerships to ensure efficiency, scalability, and cost-effectiveness.

CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  Regulation (EU) No 472/2013, adopted on 21 May 2013, establishes a comprehensive policy framework for addressing situations where Member States in the euro area (a) experience or are threatened with serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability, leading to potential spill-over effects on other Member States in the euro area, or (b) request or receive financial assistance. Specifically, Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 principally concerns three regimes. Firstly, that Regulation empowers the Commission to subject a euro area Member State to enhanced surveillance in case of threats to a Member State’s financial stability which are likely to have adverse spill-over effects on other euro area Member States, or when a euro area Member State is in receipt of precautionary financial assistance. Under this surveillance, the concerned Member State’s fiscal situation is monitored more closely, and it is required to adopt measures aimed at addressing the source of difficulties, taking into account recommendations stemming from the Union’s economic governance framework. Finally, upon request from the Commission, the concerned Member State can also be required to provide additional information related to its financial sector. Secondly, Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 also sets out the legal framework for macroeconomic adjustment programmes associated with financial assistance from the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) or the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), ensuring that they are properly aligned and synchronised with the Union’s economic governance framework. Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 exempts the concerned Member State from submitting a stability programme, which is instead integrated into the macroeconomic adjustment programme. In addition, the concerned Member State is exempted from submitting reports when it is subject to an excessive deficit procedure, and from the monitoring and assessment under the European Semester, to avoid overlaps and duplication of reporting. Thirdly, Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 establishes the rules governing post-programme surveillance, applicable once a macroeconomic adjustment programme ends and until 75% of the received assistance is repaid.  Since the adoption of Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 in 2013, the regulatory landscape has undergone significant changes. In particular, the Union’s economic governance framework was reformed in 2024 with the adoption of Regulations (EU) 2024/1263, 2024/1264 and Directive (EU) 2024/1265. The reform introduced new concepts and made changes to the structure of the Union’s economic governance framework. In particular, national medium-term fiscal-structural plans, introduced by Regulation (EU) 2024/1263, are the cornerstone of the 2024 reform. They replaced the Stability and Convergence Programmes and the National Reform Programmes, thereby bringing together the fiscal, reform and investment commitments of each Member State within a common framework. Given the urgency at that time for the co-legislators to agree on a reform of the EU economic governance framework, the Commission did not propose amendments to other pieces of legislation that form part of the Union’s economic governance framework.  Other relevant changes to the application of Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 have also occurred since 2013. In particular, the creation of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) has led to a new division of responsibilities for the supervision of credit entities. Furthermore, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), which was created as a temporary crisis resolution mechanism by euro area countries in June 2010, may no longer engage in new financing programmes as of 1 July 2013.  There is thus a need to ensure consistency between Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 and the reformed EU economic governance framework, as well as to reflect the institutional developments that have occurred since 2013.  In addition , since the adoption of Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 in 2013 , the Commission has gained valuable insights and experience regarding the activation of both enhanced surveillance when a euro area Member State i s in receipt of precautionary financial assistance and post-programme surveillance when a Member State exits a macroeconomic adjustment programme . In particular, experience has shown that the current design of enhanced surveillance may have a deterrent effect on Member States seeking precautionary financial assistance and may result in the application of additional surveillance when not warranted. Similarly, with regards to post-programme surveillance , the European Court of Auditors, in its Special Report No 18/2021 1 , has identified certain shortcomings in the effectiveness of post-programme surveillance, including a lack of clear focus and objectives, as well as overlaps with other economic surveillance processes, such as the European Semester. The amendments to Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 , required to reflect the reforms to the EU e conomic g overnance f ramework and recent institutional developments , also provide an opportunity to improve and fine-tune enhanced surveillance and post-programme surveillance, by incorporating the lessons learned and making targeted improvements to ensure their continued effectiveness. In doing so, the proposed amendments will introduce several simplifications to Regulation (EU) No 472 / 2013 , thus simplifying the broader EU e conomic g overnance framework, reducing administrative burden for Member States, and contributing to the Commission’s simplification agenda.  Considering the above, the objective of this proposal is first to ensure consistency between Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 and the reformed Union economic governance framework. Secondly, the proposal aims at reflecting the institutional developments that have occurred since 2013, including regarding the creation of the SSM and the fact that the EFSF can no longer enter into new financing programmes. Thirdly, in light of the experience accrued through the application of Regulation (EU) No 472/2013, the proposal also seeks to clarify the application of enhanced surveillance when a Member State whose currency is the euro is in receipt of precautionary financial assistance, explicitly linking its application to precautionary support that requires new policy measures. Similarly, the proposal seeks to clarify the objective and scope of post-programme surveillance, in order to increase its coherence with the reformed Union economic governance framework, as well as to achieve targeted streamlining, in order to avoid a duplication of reporting requirements.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  The proposed amendments to Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 are consistent with the existing policy provisions in the policy area, considering the significant changes that have occurred in the regulatory landscape since its adoption in 2013. The EU economic governance framework, which entered into force on 30 April 2024, following the amendments to Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 and the adoption of Regulation (EU) 2024/1263, introduces important modifications to the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact, and the proposed amendments to Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 ensure consistency with these changes. Specifically, the proposed amendments take into account the introduction of the medium-term fiscal-structural plan and the interaction with the enhanced surveillance procedure, as set out in Article 32 of Regulation (EU) 2024/1263. Furthermore, the proposed amendments are consistent with the creation of the SSM under Council Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013.  • Consistency with other Union policies  The proposal to amend the regulation will contribute to the Commission’s simplification agenda aimed at boosting competitiveness and safeguarding economic, social and environmental goals by reducing regulatory burdens and simplifying EU laws thereby making their implementation easier.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  The legal basis of the proposal is Article 136 in combination with Article 121(6) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Article 136 provides that in order to ensure the proper functioning of economic and monetary union, and in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Treaties, the Council shall, in accordance with the relevant procedure from among those referred to in Articles 121 and 126, adopt measures specific to those Member States whose currency is the euro: (a) to strengthen the coordination and surveillance of their budgetary discipline; (b) to set out economic policy guidelines for them, while ensuring that they are compatible with those adopted for the whole of the Union and are kept under surveillance. Article 121(6) provides that the European Parliament and the Council may, acting by means of regulations in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, adopt detailed rules for the multilateral surveillance of Member States.  Articles 136 and 121(6) TFEU have been used as the legal basis for Regulation (EU) No 472/2013, which would be amended by the current proposal.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  The economic and financial stability of the euro area has a Union dimension, as the implications of macroeconomic imbalances and financial distress in one Member State can have consequences for the entire euro area. Given the interconnectedness of the European economy, Member States acting alone would not be able to adequately address the complexities and spill-over effects of economic instability. Furthermore, the objectives of the amendments, namely, to ensure consistency with the reformed EU economic governance framework and streamline that framework, cannot be achieved at the level of the Member States as they require changes to EU legislation. The proposal is therefore in conformity with the subsidiarity principle set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU).  • Proportionality  The proposal respects the proportionality principle set out in Article 5 of the TEU, as it aims to update and refine the existing framework for enhanced surveillance, macroeconomic adjustment programmes, and post-programme surveillance, while ensuring that the proposed measures are limited to what is necessary to achieve these objectives. The policy choices outlined in the proposal, such as clarifying the objectives of post-programme surveillance and making enhanced surveillance more reactive to risks, are designed to address specific deficiencies and limitations identified in the current framework. These changes are necessary to achieve the objectives of preventing and correcting macroeconomic imbalances, ensuring the financial stability of the euro area, and promoting economic convergence. The proposal does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the consistency of the EU economic governance framework and the simplification of that framework, as it builds upon existing structures and processes, and introduces targeted adjustments to address specific challenges, such as the lack of clear objectives for post-programme surveillance and the need for more differentiated surveillance regimes.  • Choice of the instrument  Article 121(6) TFEU provides for the adoption of regulations. Therefore, a regulation amending Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 is the appropriate legal instrument.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  Backward looking assessments of the EU e conomic g overnance framework , also comprising an assessment of Regulation (EU) 472/2013 , were published in February 2020 2 and November 2022 3 . The Commission Communication of February 2020 was accompanied by a Commission Staff Working Document 4 .  The Commission's February 2020 communication found that the framework for surveillance of Member States experiencing, or threatened with, serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability had led to a number of improvements and generally worked well. Nonetheless, the importance of retaining adequate national ownership of programmes was highlighted, as well as that issues of transparency and accountability also persist. In particular, the Commission Staff Working Document found that Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 allowed to preserve the financial stability of the euro area, notably by establishing procedures related to macroeconomic adjustment programmes. It also found that Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 contributed to a closer coordination of economic policies and a sustained convergence of euro area Member States by ensuring consistency between the normal surveillance cycle of the European Semester and the strengthened surveillance under Regulation (EU) No 472/2013. In its communication of November 2022, the Commission suggested to make changes to the application of post-programme surveillance, by focusing the scope of surveillance on (i) assessing repayment capacity through considering the economic, fiscal and financial situation; (ii) monitoring the implementation of unfinished reforms that begun under the adjustment programme; and (iii) assessing whether corrective measures are needed in the context of concerns for repayment capacity or continued market access. It was also suggested to link the intensity of post-programme surveillance with the change in focus and with the assessment of risks.  The European Court of Auditors, in its Special Report No 18/2021, found that while post-programme surveillance was an appropriate tool, its efficiency was hampered by unclear objectives and insufficient streamlining and focus on implementation. This report also highlighted the need for a clearer focus and objectives for post-programme surveillance, as well as a reduction in administrative burden and overlaps with other economic surveillance processes, such as the European Semester.  • Stakeholder consultations  Since the adoption of Regulation (EU) No 472/2013, in 2021, the European Court of Auditors issued its Special Report 18/2021 on the Commission’s surveillance of Member States exiting a macroeconomic adjustment programme. This report recommended streamlining and improvements to the scope and procedure of post-programme surveillance in order to avoid duplications of reporting and to limit administrative burden on Member State’s authorities.  Discussions have taken place between the Commission and Member States in the Economic and Financial Committee (EFC) and the Eurogroup Working Group (EWG) on the main elements of amendments to Regulation (EU) No 472/2013, where Member States expressed an openness to examine the proposals for simplification that would be put forward by the Commission. Furthermore, a discussion took place with the ECON committee of the European Parliament , which emphasised the objectives of the simplification package, namely, to provide legal clarity and targeted simplification, and sketched out the main elements of amendments to Regulation (EU) No 472/2013, similar to the information provided to the Member States in the respective committees.  • Collection and use of expertise  N/A  • Impact assessment  This proposal does not create a new instrument but amends existing legislation to ensure consistency of the economic and budgetary surveillance of Member States in the euro area experiencing or threatened with serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability with other elements of the reformed EU economic governance framework. The proposal also aims to simplify existing procedures and to reduce the reporting requirements for Member States. The proposed amendments focus on targeted changes to the existing Regulation (EU) No 472/2013. As stated above in the section dedicated to compliance with the principle of subsidiarity, there are no other options for eliminating these inconsistencies between this regulation and other elements of the framework. For these reasons, no formal impact assessment was carried out.  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  N/A  • Fundamental rights  The proposal does not have consequences on fundamental rights.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  The proposal does not have implications for the EU budget.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  The proposed amendments to Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 do not require measures to facilitate their implementation and do not pose implementation challenges for Member States.  Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 requires that the Commission produce a report every five years on the application of the regulation, reviewing the following elements: (1) the effectiveness of the regulation in promoting its objectives; (2) the progress in ensuring closer coordination of economic policies and sustained convergence of economic performance of the Member States; (3) the contribution of the regulation to achieving sustainable and inclusive growth and social and economic resilience. The report of the Commission should be accompanied, where appropriate, by a proposal to amend the regulation.  • Explanatory documents (for directives)  N/A  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  The proposal makes targeted changes to Regulation (EU) No 472/2013. They consist in eliminating inconsistencies with the pieces of legislation that resulted from the 2024 reform of the EU economic governance framework, and institutional developments that have occurred since 2013, as well as in simplifying and clarifying elements in line with the Commission’s simplification agenda aimed at reducing regulatory burdens and simplifying EU laws to make their implementation easier.  Inconsistencies in Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 largely concern outdated references to other acts and financial assistance frameworks that are no longer applicable, including as a result of the 2024 reform of the EU economic governance framework, requiring amendments to Articles 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10 and 12. More specifically: (i) a number of cross-references to former Regulation (EU) No 1466/97 and Regulation (EU) No 1467/97 became outdated and are proposed to be updated to reflect the 2024 reform of the EU economic governance framework which consisted in repealing Regulation (EU) 1466/97 and replacing it with Regulation (EU) 2024/1263, and in amending Regulation (EU) No 1467/97; (ii) outdated references to Stability and National Reform Programmes of Member States have been removed, as they have been merged into national medium-term fiscal-structural plans following the 2024 reform; (iii) outdated references to the exemption of Member States subject to a macroeconomic adjustment programme under Article 7 of Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 from submitting a stability programme under Article 3 of Regulation (EU) No 1466/97 have been replaced by references to national-medium term fiscal structural plans, where the obligations outlined in the national medium-term fiscal-structural plan should be integrated into the design of the macroeconomic adjustment programme; and iv) Article 12 on the exemption of monitoring and assessment of the European Semester for economic policy coordination when a Member State is subject to a macroeconomic adjustment programme is removed as this exemption became obsolete following the reform to the EU economic governance framework. Additionally, references to the EFSF have been removed with respect to future financial assistance obtained by Member States from this Facility, as it is no longer active as a lending institution for new financial assistance programmes.  The proposed amendments to Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 align its provisions with the new division of tasks introduced by Council Regulation (EU) 1024/2013, which conferred specific prudential supervision responsibilities to the ECB. To ensure consistency with this new framework, the proposed amendments to Article 3 make a reference to this new division of tasks, particularly when a Member State under enhanced surveillance is required to carry out stress test exercises or sensitivity analyses to assess the resilience of the financial sector or submit regular assessments of its supervisory capacities over the financial sector.  Furthermore, the proposed amendments to Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 aim at addressing the concern that the current design of enhanced surveillance may deter Member States from seeking precautionary financial assistance when needed. To strike a balance between effective surveillance and the need to avoid disincentivising Member States to seek precautionary assistance, when necessary, the amendments aim to clarify the circumstances under which enhanced surveillance applies to Member States receiving precautionary financial assistance. Specifically, Articles 2 and 3 propose that enhanced surveillance should only be automatically triggered when a Member State receives financial assistance that requires the adoption of new policy measures, regardless of whether the assistance is provided by other Member States, third countries, the EFSM, ESM, or international financial institutions like the IMF. This means that Member States receiving financial assistance with conditions, such as an ESM Enhanced Conditions Credit Line (ECCL), as established in Article 14 of the Treaty establishing the European Stability Mechanism, should be subject to enhanced surveillance, even if the assistance has not yet been drawn. For new ESM precautionary financial assistance instruments, the Commission should assess on a case-by-case basis whether the receipt of such assistance warrants enhanced surveillance, ensuring a more nuanced and targeted approach to surveillance. The additional ability for the Commission to voluntarily subject Member States to enhance surveillance, if warranted, remains.  The proposed changes to Article 14 clarify the scope and objective of post-programme surveillance, where post-programme surveillance would focus on monitoring and assessing the repayment capacity of Member States that have received financial assistance, as well as the implementation of relevant reforms not already covered by the national medium-term fiscal-structural plan. The surveillance will also identify the need for corrective measures to mitigate any risks to repayment. By clarifying the objectives and focus of post-programme surveillance, the amended regulation provides a simplified and proportionate framework for the surveillance of Member States exiting a macroeconomic adjustment programme.  Furthermore, the amendments introduce a tiered system of post-programme surveillance that differentiates the level of scrutiny according to repayment risk and the need for corrective measures. This enables a more reactive and targeted approach to post-programme surveillance. A key feature of this system is a specific assessment of the Member State's capacity to repay the financial assistance received, which will be carried out by the Commission five years after the application of post-programme surveillance. This assessment will consider factors such as debt sustainability, debt-to-GDP ratio, excessive deficit procedures, borrowing conditions and financial stability conditions. If the Commission concludes that there are no material risks to repayment and after the Economic and Financial Committee has delivered an opinion, it would be possible to suspend regular assessments for a period of five years, subject to certain conditions. This facilitates a more effective use of resources in supporting the Member State's efforts to exit a macroeconomic adjustment programme and promote a more efficient and targeted application of post-programme surveillance, in line with the Commission’s overall simplification efforts.  A new Article 18a provides for the establishment of administrative arrangements between the Commission and relevant providers of financial assistance to euro area Member States, including the ESM. The purpose of these arrangements is to facilitate close cooperation and information-sharing between the Commission and these providers, thereby ensuring a coordinated and cohesive approach to economic surveillance and financial assistance.  The application of Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 to Member States that were in receipt of financial assistance on 30 May 2013 (Article 16) and the transitional provisions (Article 17) are proposed to be deleted as they are outdated.  Finaly, the future reviews of the functioning of Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 were aligned to the reviews on the functioning of Regulation (EU) 2024/1263 (Article 19).  2025/0312 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 as regards the economic and budgetary surveillance of Member States in the euro area experiencing or threatened with serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 136 in combination with Article 121(6) thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank 5 ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) Regulation (EU) No 47 2 /2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council 6 lays down provisions for strengthening the economic and budgetary surveillance of Member States whose currency is the euro, where those Member States (a) experience or are threatened with serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability or to the sustainability of their public finances, leading to potential adverse spill-over effects on other Member States in the euro area; or (b) request or receive financial assistance.  (2) The Union’s economic governance framework was reformed in 2024. The reform aimed to facilitate effective economic surveillance, anchored in a common framework that ensures equal treatment and multilateral policy coordination. The objectives of the reform were to further promote sound and sustainable public finances, sound and inclusive growth and resilience through reforms and investment, prevent the occurrence of excessive deficits, and strengthen national ownership. To achieve those objectives, the reform introduced new concepts and made changes to the structure of the Union’s economic governance framework. The reform was implemented with the adoption of Regulation (EU) 2024/1263 of the European Parliament and of the Council 7 , Council Regulation (EU) 2024/1264 8 and Council Directive (EU) 2024/1265 9 .  (3) In its Communication of 11 February 2025 entitled ‘A simpler and faster Europe: Communication on implementation and simplification’ 10 , the Commission set out a vision for an implementation and simplification agenda that aims to boost competitiveness and safeguard economic, social and environmental goals by reducing regulatory burdens and simplifying Union law thereby making its implementation easier.  (4) In the context of the 2024 reform of the Union’s economic governance framework and with the view to simplifying, consolidating and codifying legislation, amendments to Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 are necessary to ensure consistency with other acts of the economic governance framework and contribute to its streamlining and simplification.  (5) The national medium-term fiscal-structural plans, introduced by Regulation (EU) 2024/1263, are the cornerstone of the 2024 reform. They replaced the Stability and Convergence Programmes and the National Reform Programmes, thereby bringing together the fiscal, reform and investment commitments of each Member State within a common framework. Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 should be amended to take into account the introduction of the national medium-term fiscal-structural plans in the common framework. In particular, the obligations arising from a national medium-term fiscal-structural plan should be duly taken into account in the design of a macroeconomic adjustment programme, with a view to ensuring a coherent and effective approach to addressing the Member State's fiscal and macroeconomic challenges. Furthermore, in accordance with Article 32 of Regulation (EU) 2024/1263, where a Member State is subject to a macroeconomic adjustment programme, it should not be required to submit a national medium-term fiscal-structural plan or an annual progress report.  (6) The European Financial Stability Facility ( ‘ EFSF ’ ) was created as a temporary crisis resolution mechanism by euro area countries in June 2010. As of 1 July 2013, the EFSF may no longer engage in new financing programmes . Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 should be amended to take that into account.  (7) Experience has shown that the current design of enhanced surveillance may have a deterrent effect on Member States seeking precautionary financial assistance and may result in the application of additional surveillance when not warranted. In order to strike a balance between the need for effective surveillance and the need to avoid disincentivising Member States to seek precautionary assistance when necessary, Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 should be amended to clarify the circumstances under which enhanced surveillance applies when a Member States is in receipt of precautionary financial assistance.  (8) A Member State that receives financial assistance on a precautionary basis from one or several other Member States or third countries, the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism ( ‘ EFSM ’ ), the European Stability Mechanism ( ‘ ESM ’ ) or another relevant international financial institution, such as the International Monetary Fund ( ‘ IMF ’ ), which requires the adoption of new policy measures, should be subject to enhanced surveillance under Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 , including if that financial assistance is not yet drawn. An ESM Enhanced Conditions Credit Line ( ‘ ECCL ’ ) requires such new policy measures and, as such, a Member State receiving such financial assistance on a precautionary basis should be subject to enhanced surveillance. With regard to new ESM precautionary financial assistance instruments, the Commission should assess on a case-by-case basis whether there are such new policy measures and, as such, whether the receipt of such financial assistance by a Member State warrants the application of enhanced surveillance under Regulation (EU) No 472 /2013 .  (9) Council Regulation (EU) 1024/2013 11 conferred specific tasks on the European Central Bank (‘ECB’) concerning policies relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions.  In order to respect the division of responsibilities between the ECB and national competent authorities of participating Member States as established by that Regulation, the provisions in Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 concerning information on or supervisory measures regarding the financial sector should be clarified to respect that division of responsibilities.  (10) Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 provides that a Member State exiting a macroeconomic adjustment programme is subject to post-programme surveillance until 75% of the received financial assistance is repaid. The European Court of Auditors, in its Special Report No 18/2021 12 , has identified certain shortcomings in the effectiveness of post-programme surveillance, including a lack of clear focus and objectives, as well as overlaps with other economic surveillance processes, such as the European Semester.  (11) In light of th o se findings, it is necessary to amend Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 to clarify the objective and scope of post-programme surveillance, in order to increase its coherence with the European e conomic g overnance framework and avoid a duplication of reporting requirements. Specifically, post-programme surveillance should focus on monitoring and assessing the repayment capacity of the concerned Member State regarding the financial assistance received , taking into account the economic, budgetary and financial condition of that Member State . That surveillance should also cover the implementation of certain reforms, to the extent that those are not already subject to monitoring under the national medium-term fiscal-structural plan. Finally, post-programme surveillance should identify the need for corrective measures to mitigate risks to the repayment of the financial assistance received.  (12) It is also necessary to amend Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 to make post-programme surveillance more proportionate to risks, by introducing a tiered system of surveillance that differentiates the level of scrutiny according to repayment risk of the financial assistance received and the need for corrective measures. In particular, five years after the application of post-programme surveillance, the Commission should be allowed to carry out a specific assessment of the Member State's capacity to repay the financial assistance received. If the Commission concludes that there are no material risks to the Member State's capacity to repay the financial assistance over the medium-term, it should be possible to suspend the regular assessments for a period of five years, subject to no material change of the circumstances . Before concluding its assessment, the Commission should ask the Economic and Financial Committee for its opinion.  (13) To ensure close cooperation with the ESM and other relevant international financial institutions when implementing Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 , the Commission should continue to seek to establish the necessary administrative arrangements. Such arrangements help to ensure that the activities of the different institutions and bodies involved in the provision of financial assistance are coordinated and mutually reinforcing.  (14) Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 should therefore be amended accordingly,  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Article 1  Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 is amended as follows:  (1) in Article 1 (1) , point (b) is replaced by the following:  ‘(b) request or receive financial assistance from one or several other Member States or third countries, the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM), the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), or another relevant international financial institution such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF).’;  (2) Article 2 is amended as follows:  (a) i n paragraph 3 , the first subparagraph is replaced by the following:  ‘Where a Member State is in receipt of financial assistance on a precautionary basis from one or several other Member States or third countries, the EFSM, the ESM, or another relevant international financial institution such as the IMF that requires the adoption of new policy measures, the Commission shall subject that Member State to enhanced surveillance.’;  (b) paragraphs 4 and 5 are deleted;  (3) Article 3 is amended as follows:  (a) in paragraph 1 , the first subparagraph is replaced by the following:  ‘A Member State subject to enhanced surveillance shall, after consulting, and in cooperation with, the Commission, acting in liaison with the ECB, the ESAs, the ESRB and, where appropriate, the IMF, adopt measures aimed at addressing the sources or potential sources of difficulties.

FRAMEWORK OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE  1.1. Title of the proposal/initiative  Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on amending Regulation (EU) No 472/2013.  1.2. Policy area(s) concerned  Strengthening of economic and budgetary surveillance of Member States in the euro area experiencing or threatened with serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability.  1.3. Objective(s)  1.3.1. General objective(s)  A first objective of the proposal is to align the legal framework established by Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 with the reformed EU economic governance framework which entered into force on 30 April 2024, repealing  Regulation (EU) No 1466/97 (and replacing it with Regulation (EU) 2024/1263) and amending Regulation (EU) No 1467/97, as well as to reflect the institutional developments that have occurred since 2013.  A second objective is to take into account the valuable experience and insights accrued through the application of Regulation (EU) No 472/2013, by clarifying the scope and application of both enhanced surveillance and post-programme surveillance. In doing so, the proposal will also contribute to the streamlining and simplification of the EU economic governance framework.  1.3.2. Specific objective(s)  To ensure consistency with the reformed EU economic governance framework, the proposed amendments to Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 will (i) update references to documents and concepts introduced by the 2024 reform, as well as cross-references to the pieces of legislation that were amended as part of that reform; (ii) remove obsolete procedures and the requirement for Member States to produce documents and additional reporting obligations that are no longer necessary following the 2024 reform.  In addition, taking into account the accrued experiences with the application of enhanced surveillance, the amendments will seek to clarify the application of enhanced surveillance when a euro area Member State is in receipt of precautionary financial assistance. Finally, taking into account relevant findings from the European Court of Auditors, the proposed amendments to Regulation (EU) No 472/2013 will clarify the scope and objective of post-programme surveillance, as well as its application, with a potential to streamline surveillance when warranted.  1.3.3. Expected result(s) and impact  The proposal should prevent duplication of reporting and lead to a reduction of administrative burden for euro area Member States threatened with financial stability issues. Furthermore, the proposal should avoid disincentivising euro area Member States from requesting precautionary financial assistance when required. Finally, the proposal should clarify the scope and objective of post-programme surveillance, resulting in a better implementation of the EU economic governance framework.  1.3.4. Indicators of performance  The Commission will produce a report every five years, reviewing (i) the effectiveness of the regulations in achieving their objectives; (ii) the progress in ensuring closer coordination of economic policies and sustained convergence of economic performances of the Member States in accordance with the TFEU; and (iii) the contribution of the regulations to achieving sustainable and inclusive growth and social and economic resilience. Where appropriate, the report would be accompanied by a proposal to amend the regulations.  1.4. The proposal/initiative relates to:   a new action   a new action following a pilot project / preparatory action 13   the extension of an existing action   a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action  1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative  1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative  N/A  1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, greater effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this section 'added value of EU involvement' is the value resulting from EU action, that is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.  Reasons for action at EU level (ex-ante): The action at EU level is necessary given the role conferred by the EU Treaties to ensure the coordination and surveillance of the economic and budgetary policies of Member States and in particular of euro area Member States, which are subject to stronger economic spillover effects including relating to financial stability. Actions by Member States alone cannot achieve these goals.  Expected generated EU added value ( ex-post ): The adoption of the amended regulation will lead to a better implementation of the EU economic governance framework by Member States, while simultaneously reducing Member States’ reporting requirements.  1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past  N/A  1.5.4. Compatibility with the multiannual financial framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments  N/A  1.5.5. Assessment of the different available financing options, including scope for redeployment  N/A  1.6. Duration of the proposal/initiative and of its financial impact   limited duration  –  in effect from [DD/MM]YYYY to [DD/MM]YYYY  –  financial impact from YYYY to YYYY for commitment appropriations and from YYYY to YYYY for payment appropriations.   unlimited duration  – Implementation with a start-up period from YYYY to YYYY,  – followed by full-scale operation.  1.7.

This update aims to align the 2013 framework with recent changes in the EU's economic governance and institutional developments. Originally, the regulation was designed to monitor and support countries experiencing financial instability, either through enhanced surveillance or by integrating them into macroeconomic adjustment programs linked to financial assistance from the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). It also included provisions for ongoing surveillance after financial assistance was provided, until a significant portion of the aid was repaid.

Since its inception, the EU's economic governance framework has seen significant reforms, introducing new concepts like national medium-term fiscal-structural plans. Additionally, the establishment of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) has changed the supervision landscape for financial entities, and the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) has stopped engaging in new financing programs. The proposed amendments aim to ensure consistency between the existing regulation and the updated governance framework, addressing issues identified in past applications, such as the deterrent effect of enhanced surveillance on countries seeking financial assistance and the lack of clear objectives in post-programme surveillance.

Key changes in the proposal include broadening the scope of financial assistance sources to include not only other Member States and mechanisms like the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM) and ESM but also third countries and other relevant entities. However, the proposal does not provide for co-financing by third parties"

CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  Farming and food are strategic sectors for the Union, providing safe and high-quality food to 450 million Europeans at affordable prices and playing a key role for European as well as global food security. At the same time, they are essential for sustaining the economy and life in rural areas, as well as an important part of the solution in the protection of climate, nature, soils, water, and biodiversity currently under stress. The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is at the heart of the European project and has committed more than 60 years ago to ensuring food security and a fair standard of living for the agricultural community, in line with the EU Treaties’ objectives.  Such commitment is as relevant today as it was then, as the EU agricultural sector faces significant challenges. The sectors attractiveness for young people needs a boost, as only a fraction of farmers is younger than 40 years. The sector is exposed to climate change, biodiversity loss, and socio-economic pressures, which threaten its long-term sustainability and livelihoods. Uneven global playing fields, some import dependencies and vulnerability to geopolitical uncertainties add to the long-term uncertainty faced by EU farmers. Investments are difficult to finance as agricultural income per worker remains significantly lower than the average wages in the whole economy (60% in 2023). Additionally, territorial imbalances and, insufficient access to knowledge and innovation – including digital solutions - contribute to the declining attractiveness of the sector, particularly among young people.  These challenges make public support necessary for the sector and at the same time call for a robust and adaptive policy response to ensure a competitive, resilient, and sustainable agricultural sector. Building on the successful previous reforms that put the CAP on the path of a performance-based and market-oriented policy, the CAP thus needs to continue to evolve and sharpen its ability to respond effectively to a changing global, EU, national and regional situation, including at farm level.  EU Heads of State have repeatedly emphasized the need to enhance the resilience of EU agriculture to ensure long-term food security, preserve the vitality of rural communities, and recognize the crucial role of the CAP in achieving these goals. At the same time, they have stressed the importance of providing a stable and predictable policy framework to support farmers in addressing environmental and climate challenges.  The Political Guidelines for the Commission mandate 2024-2029 underscore the importance of ensuring that farmers have a fair and sufficient income to continue innovating and delivering benefits to the Union as a whole. To achieve this, the guidelines call for reducing bureaucratic burdens, rewarding farmers who work in harmony with nature, and strengthening their position in the food value chain to protect them from unfair trading practices. This requires striking a balance between incentives, investments, and regulation to build a more competitive and resilient agricultural sector.  The Commission's Communication of 19 February 2025, ""A Vision for Agriculture and Food,"" outlines key principles for the CAP post-2027. These principles include a CAP based on clear objectives and targeted requirements, with Member States assuming greater responsibility and accountability for meeting policy objectives. The Communication also highlights the essential role of the CAP in supporting and stabilizing farmers' incomes, attracting a new generation of farmers, and ensuring a simpler and more targeted policy with a clearer balance between incentives and mandatory requirements. Furthermore, it emphasises the need for greater flexibility for farmers and a shift from conditions to incentives. The new financial framework presents an opportunity to build on the recent reform, aligning rules for support to achieve competitiveness, resilience, innovation, and sustainability objectives in a cohesive and effective manner.  The 2023-27 CAP Strategic Plans have proven to be effective tools for integrated policy implementation, facilitating cooperation among governments, stakeholders, and civil society. The new delivery mechanism introduced in 2023 offers a policy- and performance-based approach, increasing flexibility and responsibility for Member States to address local specificities within a common EU framework. Building on this experience, there is an opportunity to further streamline the CAP's implementation and to increase synergies and flexibility within and with other spending areas.  In the context of the MFF legislative proposals for 2028-2034, this proposal dedicated to agriculture is justified by the specificities of the CAP. While the future CAP will align with the streamlined delivery mechanisms for EU spending programmes under the new MFF and its programming and delivery will be part of the National and Regional Partnership Fund and plans , this proposal lays down specific rules which are needed to steer the CAP towards:  · Contributing to a more targeted income support for farmers and their long-term competitiveness , directing support towards farmers that actively contribute to food security, towards the economic vitality of the farms and specific sectors and the preservation of the environment, while enabling access to complementary sources of income.  · Improving the attractiveness of the profession and fostering generational renewal , helping the access of young people and those entering in the profession, including though promoting skills development, better access to capital and better working conditions.  · Enhancing the role of the farming and forest sector for climate action, ecosystem services provision, the conservation of biodiversity and natural resources , by rewarding farmers who work with nature and incentivising a move towards more sustainable production methods which are adapted to the local conditions, and delivering the right balance of investments, incentives and requirements.  · Improving resilience, ability to cope with crises and risks , providing stronger and more targeted incentives for farmers to reduce their vulnerability and exposure to risks including through adaptation ad the farm level and diversification of production, promoting more ambitious transformation changes in places where business as usual is not sustainable in the longer term, and strengthening the link between prevention and crisis management.  · Accelerate innovation, enhancing access to knowledge and accelerating the digital transition for a thriving agriculture sector through strengthening agricultural knowledge and innovation systems including access to impartial and qualified advisory services, targeted training, fostering the wider uptake of digital solutions.  · Enhancing working conditions and life in rural areas, by offering relief services and support for cooperation, business development, value added and projects allowing rural development.  In achieving these objectives, the proposal aims to realise the full potential of strategic planning through a simpler and more flexible policy framework that enhances synergies and complementarities across sectors . The new Multiannual Financial Framework provides an opportunity for the EU budget spending for agriculture to be more impactful. Building on the current system based on strategic plans, the programming will benefit from a further evolution while ensuring the coherence and synergies with the common framework provided by the full set of MFF proposals, particularly the Commission proposals for a Regulation establishing the National and Regional Partnership Fund for the period 2028-2034 (‘NPRF Regulation’), the proposal for a Regulation on Common performance framework (‘Performance Regulation’), the proposal for a European Competitiveness Fund and the proposal for a Research Framework Programme . As regards pre-accession support, the proposal for a Global Europe will prepare candidate countries by putting in place the required structures for their agriculture systems to gradually align with the CAP.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  This proposal is fully consistent with the CAP TFEU objectives. It modernises the way the TFEU provisions are implemented, in line with the orientations of the MFF 2028-2034, the Vision for agriculture and food and the simplification efforts, while adapting to current challenges.  Article 39 TFEU sets out the objectives of the CAP:  · to increase agricultural productivity by promoting technical progress and by ensuring the rational development of agricultural production and the optimum utilisation of the factors of production, in particular labour;  · thus to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community, in particular by increasing the individual earnings of persons engaged in agriculture;  · to stabilise markets;  · to assure the availability of supplies;  · to ensure that supplies reach consumers at reasonable prices.  • Consistency with other Union policies  Agriculture is a major contributor to the EU global competitiveness . The Union is a large importer of commodities and an export champion for valuable agriculture and food products and has therefore an impact on food systems outside the Union. The proposal, in line with Article 208 TFEU, takes into account the Union development cooperation’s objectives of poverty eradication and sustainable development in developing countries, in particular by ensuring that Union support to farmers has no or minimal trade effects.  Agriculture and forestry cover 84% of the Union territory. The sector both depends on and influences the state of the environment. CAP specific objectives naturally include environmental and climate action . For example, the CAP contributes to climate adaptation and water resilience, such as flood risk mitigation and water management through landscape restoration, while also supporting biodiversity and conservation initiatives. Similarly, the CAP can support renewable energy projects and bioeconomy, thus contributing to the EU’s energy transition and circularity objectives.  The proposal puts a strong focus on supporting young farmers and promotes generational renewal , in line with the Commission’s focus on youth .  The CAP supports income for farmers and thus contributes to the enhancement of social objectives and policies in several important ways: targets farmers most in need, supports the diverse socio-cultural characteristics of EU rural areas, including job creation and good workers conditions in farming and rural areas. It is necessary to protect final beneficiaries and ensure predictability for the income support component of the CAP and to target and steer the support efforts, which this regulation provides for. Finally, the CAP finances skills and knowledge to support farmers in their socio-economic, green and digital transition. Strengthened agricultural education, lifelong learning opportunities, and peer-to-peer. With the new structure it can better align its instruments with the national training systems and research programmes.  Agriculture has a direct link with the “ one health ” concept. In this respect, the proposal provides a set of instruments that aim at ensuring high quality food production, reducing use of pesticides and antimicrobials, improving animal welfare conditions, as well as biosecurity measures at farm level to prevent outbreaks of pests and animal diseases.  The CAP contributes to cohesion and the right to stay by fostering a diverse and resilient rural economy in rural areas , supporting for example business opportunities, agro-tourism, infrastructure, and the bioeconomy via its LEADER strategies. This aligns with the Long-Term Vision for Rural Areas goals, emphasizing economic diversification in rural environments for farmers.  Like in other sectors, agriculture and rural areas should make better use of innovation to enhance competitiveness, sustainability and resilience. New technology and knowledge, in particular digital technologies, improve resource efficiency. The proposal reinforces the links to research policy by putting the organisation of knowledge exchange prominently in the policy delivery model. The CAP and the EU research and innovation policy can significantly enhance agricultural sector competitiveness and resilience. Similarly, the emphasis placed on digitisation allows linking up to the EU Digital and AI Agenda, but also limit reporting burden.  There are many opportunities for synergies between the CAP and other EU policies, that the new planning mechanism will allow to better exploit.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  Article 38 TFEU empowers the Union to define and implement a common agriculture policy. Article 39 TFEU sets the objectives of the CAP, which include the increase of agricultural productivity, a fair standard of living for the agricultural community, stabilise markets, assure the availability of supplies and that these supplies reach consumers at reasonable prices.  The legal basis for this proposal is Article 43(2) TFEU.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union provides for shared competence for agriculture between the Union and the Member States, while establishing a common agricultural policy with common objectives and a common implementation.  In the current delivery model, the Union has moved towards setting the basic policy parameters (objectives of the CAP, broad types of intervention, basic requirements), while Member States take greater responsibility and are more accountable for how they meet the objectives and achieve agreed targets. In this framework, the proposal for the CAP post-2027 continues to ensure a level playing field among Member States and farmers in the single market, guaranteeing food security throughout the Union, and addressing challenges of a cross-border and global nature.  In line with the Vision for Agriculture and Food and seeing the Union's highly diversified farming environment with different physical parameters, a one-size-fits-all approach is not suitable to delivering the desired results. A greater level of integration with various policies and flexibility for Member States will make it possible to better take into account local conditions and needs. Member States will be in charge of tailoring CAP interventions to maximise their contribution to Union objectives, based on recommendations from the Commission.  • Proportionality  The economic, environmental and social challenges facing the EU's farming sector and rural areas require a substantial response and a lasting effort which does justice to the EU dimension of those challenges. The CAP policy framework is accompanied by a robust and commensurate budget in the NRPF. The greater power of choice offered to Member States in selecting and adapting available policy tools within the CAP to meet EU common objectives, is proportionate  to the level of action required in the face of needs and challenges.  • Choice of the instrument  The Common agricultural policy has its legal basis in Articles 42-43 TFEU and has shown over more than 60 years of history that it remains relevant, necessary and is evolving over time. A well targeted policy, providing the right steer will ensure the right conditions for farmers and rural areas to strive and ensure food security and generational renewal in a sustainable way.  The legal act sets out the specific policy aspects genuine to the CAP, its focus and its steer, creating rights for and obligations on Member States and final beneficiaries. Due to its long-term and strategic nature, and the nature of its expenditure being income support, investments and cooperation an integrated but self-standing legal basis is justified. Taking into account the overall MFF governance system, the most appropriate vehicle to operationalize the proposed framework is a dedicated regulation on the Common Agriculture Policy, which complements the proposed NRPF Regulation and Performance Regulation with specific provisions applicable to Common Agriculture Policy. It works together with the CMO, as in the past.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  In November 2023, the Commission published a report on the joint efforts of all the CAP Strategic Plans in the EU Member States (under the currently applicable Regulation (EU) 2021/2115) highlighting some key elements:  · The new CAP Strategic Plans are an appropriate tool to pursue the CAP policy objectives;  · The CAP Strategic Plans show continued support for farm income, economic sustainability and resilience of the agricultural sector;  · There is a need to reinforce risk management tools and their increased uptake across the Union through EU or national schemes;  · The plans are greener than in the previous CAP period; but there is more potential to contribute to climate change mitigation, in particular by enhancing carbon sequestration, while climate adaptation challenges call for a more holistic and longer-term approach that requires relevant management practices and investment;  · There is progress on sustainable management of natural resources, in particular on soil and reducing dependency on chemical inputs;  · More holistic approaches to specific sectors will be needed, encompassing their economic, social and environmental vulnerabilities and benefits: for example, enhancing the positive influence of extensive livestock systems on biodiversity, carbon sequestration, landscapes, cultural heritage and rural livelihoods;  · And, lastly, the overall situation also depends on elements outside the CAP, as well as on other external factors such as the evolution of markets and consumer preferences.  In that overview report summarising the collective ambition and joint effort of Member States, the Commission considered that additional attention is particularly needed on the following areas: reinforcing skills, training and advisory capacity at all levels; fostering exchanges of good practices to better guide Member States and stakeholders; reducing the administrative burden of specific interventions; and monitoring implementation and results (as well as adjusting CAP Strategic Plans where necessary).  • Stakeholder consultations  The Commission actively engaged with stakeholders in the preparation of the MFF initiatives.  A strategic dialogue on the future of EU agriculture was launched in January 2024, bringing together 29 key stakeholders from the European agri-food sectors, civil society, rural communities and academia to reach a common understanding and set a vision for the future of EU's farming and food systems. The Strategic Dialogue highlighted the need to continue providing socio-economic support targeted to the farmers who need it most; promoting positive environmental, social, and animal welfare outcomes for society; and invigorating enabling conditions for rural areas. It found that reaching the EU’s objectives in terms of agriculture and food production, rural development, climate neutrality, and biodiversity restoration requires a dedicated and commensurate budget that matches all ambitions in a balanced and equal importance. Such principle is essential for making the transition economically profitable, promoting generational renewal, invigorating rural areas and supporting farms at a competitive disadvantage, yet essential for agricultural diversity in the EU.  Furthermore, in the framework of the recently established European Board for Agriculture and Food (EBAF), bringing together organisations representing the farming community, other actors of the food supply chain, and civil society, a dedicated discussion took place on 19 May 2025 and on 19-20 June 2025 on how to better target direct payments and move from conditions to incentives in the CAP post-2027.  Additional inputs on the future of the CAP were collected through dedicated meetings organized in the framework of existing EU stakeholders' platforms and ad-hoc technical workshops bringing together EU stakeholders and Member States.  • Collection and use of expertise  In order to gather evidence and knowledge from experts on CAP-related issues a set of technical workshops were organised between December 2023 and May 2024. These workshops allowed to exchange views between EU stakeholders, Member States and Commission services, and to advance in the formulation of the key conclusions and issues to take into account in the modernisation and simplification process of the CAP.  The first workshop on resilience concluded on the need to strengthen risk management tools at farm level and risk sharing opportunities along the value chain, with a more holistic approach, including on prevention. A second workshop focused on food security, a third workshop on sustainability concluded with a broad support on the need to help farmers in testing new innovations, more independent advice. A fourth workshop on CAP governance and performance confirmed the overall support for the new delivery model of the CAP, participants called on the need of stability, flexibility and simplification (especially for farmers); explore more voluntary approaches; increase the ability to respond to external shocks; proportionality in controls and penalties.  A last workshop focused on solidarity and rural areas and highlighted a general support to ensure more integrated policy responses, essential for the breadth of rural challenges, CAP cannot do it all, best practices exist but are not picked up, and the need for more capacity building for administrations and simpler frameworks.  A Commission foresight project on digital transition for farmers and rural communities included a series of participatory workshops with stakeholders, between March 2022 and May 2023. The Commission participated, alongside the Member States, in the foresight exercise undertaken by the Spanish Presidency on Open Strategic Autonomy, that included agri-food as part of four strategic sectors.  Finally, an implementation dialogue in June 2025 chaired by Commissioner Hansen allowed to identify priorities to improve the current CAP instruments.  • Impact assessment  The proposal was informed by the impact assessment carried out in the context of the MFF 2028-2034 Commission NPRF proposal, which evaluated options for the NPR plan's design, focusing on two key aspects: the delivery model, which determines how funds are disbursed, and the management mode, which governs how EU spending is implemented and overseen.  The impact assessment evaluated options for integrating the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) into a single plan.  Option 1 (CAP outside of the NPR Plans) would be building on the expertise gained from implementing the current CAP Strategic Plans. This approach would ensure continuity, allow for manageable changes, and clarify responsibilities at the Union and national levels.  The further integration of CAP would bring further simplification and greater synergies in achieving the policy’s objectives and ensure predictability for beneficiaries. On the other hand, a one-fund approach for the future CAP, while allowing for targeted support, would limit the ability to address emerging or unforeseen needs and changing priorities. However, to enhance efficiency, there is potential for additional harmonization of key policy design aspects, such as monitoring, performance, and audit systems, across the future Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF). This would create synergies in administrative procedures, reducing costs for Member States.  In contrast, the impact assessment shows that fully integrating the CAP (Option 2b) would necessitate introducing specific rules to ensure the integrity of the single market and fair competition among farmers, particularly for instruments directly supporting farm income, such as direct payments, which are crucial for farmers' livelihoods.  According to the impact assessment having one plan per Member State would ensure more coherent programming, reflecting national and regional needs while supporting Union priorities. A single envelope per Member State would enable efficient and flexible allocation of funding, allowing for easy reallocation of resources to address new priorities or challenges. Overall, the impact assessment concludes that a broader scope and integrated management approach would bring significant benefits, including increased coherence, simplicity, and flexibility.  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  Simplification is an overarching priority of the Commission with the aim to reduce burden and over complexity and favour speed and flexibility.  The number of provisions relating to the common agricultural policy has been drastically reduced, and coherence achieved between the relevant articles in the NRPP, the CAP regulation and the Common market organisation regulation. Overall, the level of detail and number of requirements is reduced while emphasis is put on provisions essential for the functioning of the CAP legal framework. This leads not only to a reduction in the overall number of provisions but also improves the overall quality of the legislation and reduces its complexity, while providing more flexibility for Member States to adjust the common CAP instruments to their specific needs and challenges.  By integrating interventions from the current two-fund structure (EAGF and EAFRD), the proposal aligns tools for competitiveness, resilience, innovation, and sustainability objectives, allowing them to work jointly towards better outcomes. This alignment not only enhances the effectiveness of the support available but also brings greater flexibility and simplification to its management, ultimately leading to more efficient and targeted interventions for farmers and authorities alike. This increased flexibility gives Member States room to design, plan and implement the tools for CAP support in the way that best addresses the specific needs of the sector.  Simplification for beneficiaries will be achieved, inter alia , through:  · simplification of conditionality (farm stewardship) . Reduction in the number of types of interventions (many merged e.g. eco - schemes and agri-env-climate commitments, significant reduction of schemes in direct payments), improved focusing of the types of interventions, key requirements only in the Regulation;  · offering more lump sums. This will allow for simplified application procedures that will reduce the burden for beneficiaries and administrations.  Simplification for Member States comes from:  · Single fund: no complex rules about transfers, no separate sets of rules for each fund Moving the burden of control from Paying agencies to existing national control competent bodies thus reducing the risks for multiple control checks on farm ;  · t he proposal also aligns timelines for payments, removing rigidities while ensuring timely payments to farmers, thus allowing a closer link to the actual implementation of interventions.  • Fundamental rights  This proposal respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union as laid down in the Commission proposal for NPRF Regulation. The provisions of that proposed Regulation concerning respect of fundamental rights and the rule of law will apply also to the support for common agriculture policy.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  In order to reap the benefits of the national and regional partnership planning, the Commission proposal on the multiannual financial framework for 2028-2034 (insert reference) includes the common agricultural policy in the NRPF. A significant part of the Fund is dedicated to income support for agriculture, which is ringfenced with a minimum of EUR 293.7 billion from the allocations of the Fund, in order to provide stability and predictability of support for beneficiaries.  This funding can be augmented within the NRPF by synergetic programming of actions that serve more than one objective, such as agro-energy, skills and social infrastructure, water or connectivity, to give just a few examples. Furthermore, the NRPF Regulation will provide funding for promotions of agricultural products,   crisis interventions and the unity safety net (integrating the current agricultural reserve) under the Facility to the tune of EUR 6.3 billion, as well as the funding part of the technical assistance for e.g. networks or monitoring. .  Funding for agriculture can benefit from projects under the European Competitiveness Fund and remain an integral part of the European Research Framework Programme, under their windows for Health, Agriculture and Bioeconomy to support research and innovation in food, agriculture, rural development and the bioeconomy. The combination will allow to preserve the tools currently available, for use in an optimised way.  Details on the financial impact of the CAP proposal are set out in the financial statement accompanying the NRPP proposal.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  This initiative will be monitored through the performance framework applicable for the 2028-2034 multiannual financial framework, which is set out in the proposal for a Regulation [performance regulation]. The performance framework provides for an implementation report during the implementation phase of the programme, as well as a retrospective evaluation to be carried out in accordance with Article 34(3) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 1 . The evaluation shall be conducted in accordance with the Commission's Better Regulation Guidelines and will be based on indicators relevant to the objectives of the Fund.  • Explanatory documents (for directives)  Not applicable.  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  This proposal is part of the MMF 2028-2034 package, including NRPF Regulation and Performance Regulation which provide funding, the framework for horizontal principles, rules on the management of the NRP Fund, financial framework, general rules concerning the content and approval of the NRP Plans and their governance, as well as the assurance package, we well as the performance framework and monitoring framework.  This proposal complements these general rules with specific rules applying to common agricultural policy and Agriculture chapter of the NRP Plans.  The proposal is also complementary to the rules set out in the proposed Regulation amending Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 2 , which will provide for rules concerning interventions in certain sectors and the school schemes.  Common Agriculture Policy Regulation:  Articles 1 and 2 provide for the scope, CAP national recommendations to be adopted and steering. Articles 3 and 4 outline elements of the environmental, climate and social architecture of the CAP including environmental and climate priority areas. Article 5 lists all CAP interventions and sets out provisions concerning Income support interventions. Articles from 6 to 20 outline requirements for CAP interventions as well as provisions for targeting.  Articles 15 and 16 detail provisions related to generational renewal provides for the starter pack for young farmers, consisting of a comprehensive set of interventions aimed at young farmers facilitating entry and establishment of farmers in the agricultural sector. Articles 18, 19, 20 cover other interventions under the CAP funded from the allocations for the NRP Plans. It establishes types of intervention for cooperation, LEADER, support for knowledge sharing and innovation in agriculture, forestry and rural areas and establishes other actions for the CAP.  Article 21 sets out CAP data governance, including provisions on authority in charge of data governance under the CAP.  Articles 22 to 25 contain general and final provisions, including delegation of power to the Commission to supplement this Regulation and implementing powers for the Commission to take measures to derogate from this Regulation to resolve specific problems in cases of a justifiable emergency, Committee procedure and final provisions.  2025/0241 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  establishing the conditions for the implementation of the Union support to the Common Agriculture Policy for the period from 2028 to 2034  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(2) thereof,  Having regard to the 1979 Act of Accession, and in particular paragraph 6 of Protocol No 4 on cotton attached thereto,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  Having regard to the opinion of the Court of Auditors 3 ,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 4 ,  Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions 5 ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) The Commission Communication of 19 February 2025 entitled ‘A Vision for Agriculture and Food’ 6 announces that the common agricultural policy (the ‘CAP’) post-2027 enhances responsibility and accountability for Member States on how they meet the CAP objectives, supporting and stabilising farmers’ incomes and attracting a future generation of farmers, and guaranteeing food security. The new CAP is to be a simpler and more targeted Union common policy, with more flexibility for farmers and a shift from requirements to incentives, for farmers.  (2) The multiannual financial framework (MFF) 2028 to 2034 legislative package includes Regulation (EU) .../... of the European Parliament and of the Council [ NRP ] establishing the National and Regional Partnership Fund (the ‘Fund’) for the period 2028 to 2034, grouping the nationally pre-allocated funds under the Fund, including the European Agriculture Guarantee Fund (EAGF) and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) established under Regulation (EU) 2021/2115 of the European Parliament and of the Council 7 and Regulation (EU) 2021/2116 of the European Parliament and of the Council 8 . The Fund should be implemented through National and Regional Partnership Plans (the ‘NRP Plans’) and the EU Facility, which aim at increasing flexibility and cater for crises and interventions that require Union level steering or coordination.  This Union support for the CAP will be provided under the Fund, in accordance with the rules governing that Fund set out in Regulation (EU) …/… [ NRP ].  (3) With regards to agriculture, the general objective of the Fund referred to in Article 3 , point (c), of Regulation (EU) .../... [ NRP ] recalls the objectives established in Article 39 TFEU. The CAP specific objectives directly contribute to sustaining Union’s quality of life and are to be implemented by the Member States through their NRP Plans .  (4) In order to ensure that the Union adequately addresses the most pressing challenges for the agricultural sector, it is appropriate to provide for a steering mechanism reflecting the orientations of the Vision for Agriculture and Food for a targeted policy. To advance towards a competitive, resilient and sustainable agricultural sector, in line with the outcome of the stakeholders’ consultations, the CAP national recommendations should provide a sufficient level of policy steering at Union level, to guide Member States in the design of their NRP Plans as regards agriculture, defining the relevant interventions on the basis of their specific challenges and needs.  (5) To ensure a level playing field and common framework for support for the Union agricultural sector, Member States should define the elements of the framework taking into account the local specificities and needs with the CAP objectives in mind, while the Union should provide the common framework for a policy that supports those who need it most.  (6) The CAP has showed a positive impact on generational renewal in agriculture, but there remain obstacles, in particular as regards the provision of basic infrastructure and services in rural areas, access to land and social safety net for young as well as for retiring farmers. To address the specific needs of young farmers and new entrants, each Member State should be required to set in the NRP Plan a strategy for generational renewal that should be based on the assessment of the specific national context, in line with the Commission's Vision for Agriculture and Food, which prioritises the long-term sustainability and attractiveness of the EU's farming and agri-food sector. The Member States should also develop a comprehensive ""starter pack"" for young farmers, designed to facilitate the entry and establishment of young farmers in the sector, including a comprehensive package of interventions targeting young farmers.  (7) In line with the objective of achieving a better balance between incentives and requirements, Member States should target support through their NRP Plans towards CAP priorities, which are essential for the long-term sustainability of agriculture. The CAP post-2027 should accelerate the transition towards more sustainable production methods, contributing to climate-neutrality objective by 2050. The new CAP should offer better rewards for delivering more ambitious ecosystem services which go beyond the results achieved through mandatory requirements. The new CAP should strike a new balance between a farm stewardship with a set of mandatory requirements, and agri-environmental and climate actions which support commitments beneficial for the environment, climate and animal welfare and a transition towards more resilient production systems.  (8) The farm stewardship should be established to guarantee compliance of the CAP support with the ""do no significant harm"" principle laid down in Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 of the European Parliament and of the Council 9 . The farm stewardship should comprise minimum environmental and social conditionality requirements, as well as protective practices designed by Member States to deliver on key objectives such as protection of soils and river courses from pollution. Member States should have the flexibility to adapt those protective practices to their specific geographical and climatic context and production systems including by establishing exemptions. To promote socially sustainable agriculture, certain CAP payments require compliance with standards on working and employment conditions, occupational safety and health. The European Charter and diverse national frameworks and labour market models should be respected, no additional obligations should be imposed on social partners or Member States regarding enforcement or controls and double corrections avoided.  (9) Income support for farmers should continue to be the central policy instrument to guarantee a fair income to farmers and sustainable farming and food production. It should contribute to fostering a competitive and resilient agricultural sector pursuing the benefits of high-quality production and resource-efficiency, while ensuring generational renewal and thus long-term food security. Income support allocations should be ringfenced to be used for Income support for farmers only, to provide stability and predictability for the Union agricultural sector. In order to ensure high impact and efficiency, the new CAP should entail a streamlined and consistent toolbox of Income support types of intervention enabling Member States to deliver on the CAP objectives.  (10) Given the need to target the support to those most in need, Member States should pay the area-based degressive income support only to those persons whose principal activity is agriculture, while ensuring that small and pluri-active farmers, who are engaged in at least a minimum level of agricultural activity, are not excluded.  (11) Recognising the need for more farm resilience and risk management, support should be granted to improve the ability of farmers to withstand increasing risks and crises, such as those related to the climate change or market instability, to enable farmers to participate in risk management tools, including support for insurance premiums and contributions to mutual funds in all Member States. A proactive approach to risk management reinforcing the sector's resilience should be promoted by fixing appropriate maximum support rates, with incentives for farmers who implement risk preventive measures.  (12) The CAP objectives should also be pursued through support for investments implemented by farmers and forest holders. Such investments may concern, inter alia, infrastructures related to the development, modernisation or adaptation to climate change of agriculture and forestry, agro-forestry practices, energy and water, installation of digital technologies in agriculture, precision farming, diversification of income sources in other activities such as agro-tourism and bioeconomy. It should also be possible to support investments in the restoration of agricultural or forestry production potential following natural disasters, adverse climatic events or catastrophic events, including fires, storms, floods, pests and diseases.  (13) Recognising the necessity for farmers to balance the professional duties with personal and family responsibilities, it should be possible to provide support for farm relief services facilitating replacement of farmers during leave for sickness, childbearing, holidays or in case of training participation. It should be possible to support establishment of these services as well as wages for temporary workers replacing the farmer.  (14) To foster social, economic, environmental and digital transition in rural areas Member States should ensure that LEADER is supported. It should be possible to grant support under the NRP Plans to quality schemes and promotion activities, short supply chain and local market development.  (15) In line with the need to boost innovation and more sustainable practices, the European Innovation Partnership for agricultural productivity and sustainability (the ‘EIP-AGRI’) should remain a key policy tool, to support interactive innovation, enhancing the exchange of knowledge between actors with a view to spreading solutions ready for practice 10 . Synergies between the CAP and the Union Research Framework Programme (FP10), established by Regulation (EU) …/… of the European Parliament and of the Council, should encourage agriculture to make the best use of research and innovation results, in particular those stemming from projects funded by FP10 and the EIP-AGRI, leading to innovations in the farming and bioeconomy sector and rural areas.  (16) Enhancing interoperability between public agricultural information systems at national level can bring significant benefits, including reduced data collection burden, improved efficiency, and enhanced policy monitoring. In pursuing this aim, Member States should adopt the ""collect once, use multiple times"" principle to reduce reporting burden. Designating a single authority to coordinate interoperability efforts and investing in unique farm IDs, the EU ID Wallet referred to in Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council 11 , and data-sharing infrastructure can reduce administrative burden, streamline reporting obligations, and empower farmers within the data value chain, ultimately supporting the goals of the CAP.  (17) In order to supplement the non-essential elements of this Regulation, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission. In order to ensure legal certainty, power should be delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation with measures ensuring that interoperability and seamless data exchange between information systems used for the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the CAP are implemented by the Member States.  (18) To ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred to the Commission to set out the Roadmap to achieve and maintain interoperability between information systems.  (19) The Commission should be empowered to adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases relating to solving specific problems while ensuring the continuity of income support in the case of extraordinary circumstances, imperative grounds of urgency so require. Moreover, the Commission should be empowered to adopt immediately applicable implementing acts, where in duly justified circumstances, extraordinary circumstances affect the granting of support and jeopardise the effective implementation of the interventions listed in this Regulation.  (20) In order to ensure smooth implementation of the measure envisaged and as a matter of urgency, this Regulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union .  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Article 1 Subject matter  In order to ensure a strong, sustainable and resilient common agricultural policy, Union food security, generational renewal and vibrant rural areas, this Regulation lays down specific conditions for the implementation of the Union support for the common agricultural policy (CAP) in accordance with the general objective laid down in Article 2, point (c), of Regulation (EU) […] [NRP].  This Union support shall be provided under the National and Regional Partnership Fund (the ‘Fund’) in accordance with the rules governing that Fund laid down in Regulation (EU) […] [NRP].  Article 2 CAP national recommendations and steering  1. The Commission shall adopt CAP national recommendations providing guidance to each Member State for the implementation of the CAP-relevant specific objectives set out in Article 3, point (d), of Regulation (EU) […]  [NRP], within their NRP Plans in line with Article 22 of that Regulation in advance of the submission of the NRP Plans by the Member States. The CAP national recommendations shall be based on the following:  (a) contribution to fair and sufficient income for farmers and their long-term competitiveness, including the farmers’ position in the value chain;  (b) improvement of attractiveness of the profession and foster generational renewal;  (c) enhancing climate action, ecosystem services provision, circular solutions, the conservation of biodiversity and natural resources, sustainable farming and improve animal welfare;  (d) improving resilience, farmers’ preparedness and ability to cope with crises and risks;  (e) enhancing the access to knowledge and accelerate innovation and the digital transition for a thriving agri- food sector .  The CAP national recommendations may be updated by the Commission, as appropriate.  2. The Commission shall base the CAP national recommendations on an analysis of the situation of the agricultural sector and rural areas, including demographic factors, structural and territorial characteristics as well as food security in each Member State.  3. In the CAP national recommendations, the Commission shall in particular identify key challenges to be addressed by each Member State in their NRP Plan, on the basis of the CAP-relevant specific objectives set out in Article 3, point (d), of Regulation (EU) […] [NRP].  Article 3 Farm stewardship  1. Farm stewardship shall comprise statutory management requirements listed in Annex I, Part A [ Annex with SMRs ], protective practices defined by Member States in the NRP Plan in accordance with paragraph 4 of this Article and Annex I, Part C, and the social conditionality system which comprises the statutory management requirements listed in Annex I, Part B.  2. Payments under interventions referred to in Article 5(1), points (a) to (f), and points (o) and (p), to the extent they concern support for local agricultural products, shall be subject to compliance with a system of statutory management requirements and protective practices collectively referred to as ‘farm stewardship’.  The list of statutory management requirements and the objectives of protective practices are set out in Annex I.  However, the conditions of farm stewardship listed in Annex I, Parts A and C, shall not apply to farmers receiving support under Article 5(1), point (g).  3. Support subject to the farm stewardship conditions shall be deemed to comply with the principle of ‘do no significant harm’ in accordance with Article 33(2), point (d), of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509.  For the purposes of this Article, ‘statutory management requirement’ means each individual requirement listed in Annex I, Parts A and B, set out within a given legal act listed in Annex I, Parts A and B, differing in substance from any other requirement in the same act.  The legal acts listed in Annex I concerning the statutory management requirements shall apply in the version that is applicable and, in the case of Directives, as implemented by the Member States. Acts implementing directives may however not have the purpose or effect of an exemption of farmers or other beneficiaries from the statutory management requirements listed in Annex I, Parts A and B.  4. Member States shall define in accordance with Annex I, Part C, at a national or regional level, protective practices to be respected by farmers and other beneficiaries receiving the support referred to in paragraph 2, to achieve the following objectives:  (a) protection of carbon-rich soils, landscape features and permanent grasslands on agricultural area;  (b) protection of soil against erosion, preservation of the soil potential, maintenance of soil organic matter, including through crop rotation or diversification, as well as protection against burning of stubble on arable land;  (c) protection of water courses and ground water against pollution and runoff.  5. Member States shall include in the NRP Plan a description of the protective practices defined for each of the objectives set out in paragraph 4 including their territorial scope, farmers and other beneficiaries subject to the practice and a summary of the protective practice. In setting the protective practices, Member States shall take utmost account of the CAP national recommendations referred to in Article 2. Member States shall adapt the protective practices to different land management systems and different environmental and climatic conditions in their territory.  6.

The proposal seeks to provide targeted income support to farmers, ensuring their competitiveness while contributing to food security and environmental preservation. It emphasizes directing support to farmers who actively contribute to these goals and encourages them to diversify their income sources.

To make farming more attractive, particularly to younger generations, the proposal promotes skills development, better access to capital, and improved working conditions. It introduces a performance-based and market-oriented approach, reducing bureaucratic burdens and rewarding environmentally friendly practices. The proposal also stresses the need for a stable and predictable policy framework to help farmers tackle environmental and climate challenges, with Member States taking greater responsibility for meeting policy objectives through incentives rather than mandatory conditions.

The proposal includes measures to differentiate payments, targeting support at farmers most in need, such as young and new farmers, women, family or small farmers, and those in areas with natural or other specific constraints. It introduces a degressive payment system, where higher income farmers receive reduced support, and sets a cap on the total amount of area-based income support per farmer. Additionally, the proposal ensures that support is primarily directed towards farmers actively contributing to food security and allows for the inclusion of small farmers and those with natural constraints in the eligible hectare calculations.

For livestock sectors, the proposal introduces a coefficient system to adjust"

EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulations (EU) No 1308/2013, (EU) 2021/2115 and (EU) No 251/2014 as regards certain market rules and sectoral support measures in the wine sector and for aromatised wine products  EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM  1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  While the Union remains the global leader in wine production, consumption, and exported value, societal and demographic changes are impacting the amount, quality, and types of wine consumed. Wine consumption in the Union has been steadily declining and is at its lowest level of the past three decades, while traditional export markets for Union wines are impacted by a combination of de-consumption and geopolitical factors, leading to more uncertain export patterns.  In addition, production is becoming unpredictable, given the wine sector’s vulnerability to climate change. With the resulting oversupply putting pressure on prices, winegrowers have less income to invest in their business and low financial reserves they can fall back on if one of the more frequent and often localised severe weather events hits their region.  The High-Level Group on Wine Policy (HLG) was established to discuss the se challenges and identify possible opportunities for the Union wine sector. The HLG was made up of Directors-General of the agricultural ministries of Union Member States and , during the first meeting, representatives of the major stakeholder organisations were also invited to present their analysis of the situation. The discussions centred around how to better support the sector in view of the current structural challenges by managing the production potential, enhancing competitiveness and exploring new market opportunities. After four meetings, the Group endorsed a document with policy recommendations 1 in December 2024. The recommendations were broadly welcomed by stakeholders and by MEPs in the meeting of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development ( COMAGRI ) of 13 January 2025.  In view of the positive reaction to the HLG recommendations, it is now expected that the most urgent and sector specific recommendations would be translated into legislative proposals as soon as possible to help the wine sector to face the serious challenges and to become more competitive. If the Commission does not act quickly, the situation will deteriorate further, with irreversible consequences for many rural areas in terms of abandoned vineyards and the loss of growth and employment opportunities.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 establishing a common organisation of the markets in agricultural products lays down provisions for the scheme of authorisations for vine plantings, which will be amended by this proposal in line with the recommendations of the HLG on the management of the production potential, making it easier for Member States to address or prevent risk of surplus production capacity in certain areas and market segments. This proposed regulation also amends the current rules on labelling to facilitate the production of wine products with a lower alcohol content and to allow for new ways to inform consumers about the characteristics of the wine they buy.  Regulation (EU) No 251/2014 on the definition, description, presentation, labelling and the protection of geographical indications of aromatised wine products is also amended to take the amendments to Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 concerning wines with a lower alcohol content into account in order to allow the production of aromatised wine products based on such wines with a lower alcohol content. To ensure that consumers are correctly informed of the nature of aromatised wine products with a lower alcoholic content, the labelling rules are also amended in line with the ones for grapevine products.  Regulation (EU) 2021/2115 establishing rules on support for strategic plans is amended by this proposal to give Member States the possibility to combine the efficient restructuring of vineyards with the need to avoid an increase of production, as recommended by the HLG. Furthermore, producer groups managing protected designations of origin and geographical indications will be able to benefit from support for developing wine tourism in their region and the maximum duration of the support for promotion and communication operations carried out in third countries will be extended. To strengthen cooperation in the wine sector, certain investments carried out by producer organisations will benefit from the maximum rate of Union financial assistance. To support producers in respect of climate change mitigation and adaptation, Member States will be given the possibility to increase the maximum Union financial assistance that can be provided for investments pursuing such objective.  The proposed policy measures should be implemented within a coherent national strategic framework to maximise their effectiveness. Member States must evaluate their impact to ensure efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and long-term benefits. Key priorities include avoiding market imbalances, preserving landscapes, sustaining rural employment, and enhancing the competitiveness of vine growers and wine producers.  • Consistency with other Union policies  By facilitating the production of wine products and aromatised wine products with a lower alcohol content, this proposal provides consumers the opportunity to reduce their alcohol intake while still enjoying wine. Giving producer groups managing protected designations of origin and geographical indications access to support for developing wine tourism in their region is in line with the aim to create opportunities for employment and growth in rural areas  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 42 and Article 43(2) thereof.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  The provisions that need to be amended to implement the recommendations of the HLG are laid down in Regulations of European Parliament and of the Council, therefore Member States cannot implement those recommendations if the Union legislation is not amended accordingly. In line with the principle of subsidiarity, several provisions of this proposal provide national authorities with wider leeway to manage the production potential more attuned to the specific situation of the wine producing regions.  • Proportionality  The policy choices of the proposal are based on the recommendations of the HLG, which represent an unanimously endorsed compromise reached after four rounds of discussions o n different policy options and are supported by all Member States. T he HLG discussions were informed by an in-depth analysis conducted by experts from the Wine Market Observatory 2 . These experts dedicated three special sessions , spanning from December 2023 to the second quarter of 2024, to assessing the state of the wine market, exploring different policy options to address current challenges and help the sector seize potential future opportunities. This proposal remains with in the limit of what is necessary to achieve the objectives already pursue d by the amended existing rules .  • Choice of the instrument  The rules that need to be amended to implement the recommendations of the HLG are laid down in three Regulations of the European Parliament and of the Council. Therefore, the chosen instrument must also be a Regulation of European Parliament and of the Council.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  Not applicable  • Stakeholder consultations  Given the urgency to adopt the initiative, no call for evidence or public consultation is planned.  • Collection and use of expertise  The HLG recommendations were the result of a wide and in-depth discussion and analysis starting already prior to the setting-up of the HLG, at first with the wine experts in the Market Observatory and stakeholders and then in the framework of the HLG with the Directors-General of the agricultural ministries of all Member States. Key stakeholders were also invited to one of the meetings of the HLG to present their views. The legal proposal is based on the HLG recommendations which were endorsed at unanimity by Member States and are supported by stakeholders and welcomed by COMAGRI.  • Impact assessment  Given the urgency to adopt the initiative, no impact assessment will be carried out. The costs and benefits of the initiative will be assessed in a Staff Working Document to be published within 3 months of its adoption.  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  This proposal aims to minimize compliance costs for SMEs above the already existing possibility to provide the list of ingredients and the nutrition declaration by electronic means, simplifying trade between Union Member States. Currently, the identification on the package or on a label attached thereto of the link (e.g. a QR-code) to the electronic means containing the list of ingredients and nutrition declaration through words (e.g. “ingredients” and/or “nutrition declaration”) is cumbersome for wine producers, and rules for the identification differ among Member States. With the proposed Regulation, the Commission will be empowered to develop, in cooperation with Member States, rules for a common approach to such identification, which will reduce costs and administrative burden especially for small producers who will be able to sell their wines in different countries with the same label. The sales denominations of the wines with a reduced alcohol content are also harmonised across the Union and will be made clearer by using terms more familiar to consumers.  • Fundamental rights  The proposal respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised, in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  This proposal has no quantifiable budgetary implications. Any changes in the Union financial assistance for the interventions under the strategic plan are made within the framework of the national financial envelopes.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  In view of the crisis the Union wine sector is currently facing, the measure should enter into force as soon as possible, except for the new labelling rules, which need to apply later to give producers time to adapt and allow for the sale of products labelled according to the previously applicable rules until the stock is exhausted.  The wine market observatory is continuously monitoring the supply and demand of different types of wine on the Union market and it will provide an insight on the developments of the market segment of low-alcohol wines, the development of which this proposed regulation aims to support. The effects of the changes to the scheme of authorisations for vine plantings will be monitored in the framework of the obligatory annual communications submitted by Member States on the implementation of the scheme.  • Explanatory documents (for directives)  Not applicable  • Detailed ex p lanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  If a vineyard is grubbed up, the vine grower can request a replanting authorisation which is valid for three years (6 years if the replanting takes place on the same parcel of land). The HLG recommended a longer validity of 8 years for all replanting authorisations to give, in this uncertain situation, vine growers more time to explore the possibility to plant varieties which are better adapted to market demand or the changing climatic conditions or to use new vineyard management techniques.  Furthermore, to alleviate pressure on winegrowers, the administrative penalties applied when a replanting authorisation is not used during its validity period, should be abolished. On the contrary, the HLG agreed to maintain the administrative penalty applied if new planting authorisations remain unused in order to discourage speculative applications from growers who do not have the intention to plant a vineyard. However, in view of the current decline in demand for wine, winegrowers who hold still valid, unused authorisations for new plantings granted to them before 1 January 2025 should be allowed to renounce, by a certain date, these authorisations without incurring an administrative penalty to remove the incentive to plant vineyards where there might be no demand for the wine they will produce.  Member States already have the possibility to set regional limits for new planting authorisations, for specific areas eligible for the production of wines with a protected designation of origin, for areas eligible for the production of wines with a protected geographical indication, or for areas without a geographical indication. They should also be given the possibility to limit the issuing of new planting authorisations at regional level for specific areas with excess supply where national or Union measures aimed to reduce the supply, such as distillation, green harvesting or grubbing up of vineyards, are or have been implemented in order to avoid further increasing the production potential of regions where supply already outstrips demand.  However, where a Member State decides to set regional limits for specific areas to avoid an excessive growth of the production potential, the Member State should also be authorised to request that the authorisations granted for the area concerned by the limit are used in that area because otherwise there is a risk that newcomers are totally excluded, which would discourage new entrants and young farmers.  While the replanting of a grubbed-up vineyard does not increase the vineyard area as a whole, Member States should be given the possibility to set rules for the replanting in order to better manage the territorial distribution of vineyards. Replanting authorisations may be used on the same holding on which the grubbing up was undertaken. Given that holdings can contain vineyards in different regions, Member States should be able to avoid the relocation of vineyards between regions when maintaining viticulture in the initial geographical region is important for socio-economic or environmental reasons, for instance for preserving vineyards on slopes and terraces or preserving landscape and avoid soil erosion. Member States should also be given the possibility to set special conditions for replanting authorisations to encourage the use of varieties and production methods that do not increase average yields.  In a context of diminishing consumption, monitoring the overall production potential is very important for the future balance of the market. The application of the planting authorisation scheme has this objective and should apply in all wine-producing Member States when a certain vineyard area is reached.  In recent years there has been an ever-evolving consumer demand for grapevine products with a reduced alcohol content. For such products, consumers are familiar with terms such as zero-alcohol, alcohol-free and low alcohol, which are however regulated differently in various Member States. Indeed, in absence of specific Union rules regarding nutrition claims referring to low alcohol levels, or the reduction or absence of alcohol or energy in beverages which normally contain alcohol, relevant national rules may apply in accordance with Article 4(4) of the Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 on nutrition and health claims made on foods (Claims Regulation). There is therefore a need to harmonise the use of these terms and to define the alcohol content linked to each of them across the EU. This should also be reflected in the rules on labelling of wine products in order to better inform the consumer of the characteristics and production methods of grapevine products with a reduced alcohol content, allowing the Union wine sector to benefit from this development in consumer demand while maintaining high quality production standards.  High consumer demand for sparkling wine products with a lower alcohol content or without alcohol represents an opportunity for the sector, but technological limitations exist for their production with the current production rules on de-alcoholisation. According to the rules currently in force, wine products must have reached the characteristics and the minimum actual alcoholic strength of the category before undergoing the de-alcoholisation process. The de-alcoholisation process removes the CO2 from sparkling wines. Therefore, it should be allowed to produce sparkling and aerated wines from de-alcoholised or partially de-alcoholised still wines through second fermentation or the addition of CO2, under the condition that they are labelled in a way that does not mislead the consumer.  The possibility to provide the list of ingredients and the nutrition declaration by electronic means has proven an effective means for operators for providing information to consumers while facilitating the functioning of the internal market and wine exports, especially for small producers. However, the absence of harmonised rules on the identification of the electronic means on the physical label and the consequent diverging solutions applied by the Member States have caused fragmentation of the single market affecting the proper marketing of wines across the Union. The Commission should thus be empowered to develop, in cooperation with Member States, rules for the identification of the electronic means providing information to consumers, in particular through a language-free system, in order to minimise costs and administrative burden for operators, and to ensure a common approach across the Union market, while taking into account the need to make information accessible to consumers. This draft regulation empowers the Commission also to adapt the electronic labelling rules to new needs arising from the fast and constant progress of digitalisation and the increasing amount of information that should be made accessible to consumers.  Member States have the possibility to adopt marketing rules to regulate the supply in the wine sector to improve and stabilise the operation of the common wine market. In the current context of a structural consumption decrease and recurrent situations of oversupply in certain regions and market segments, it is appropriate to clarify that such rules can include the setting of maximum grape yields and the management of wine stocks. Moreover, producer organisations can play an important role in strengthening winegrowers’ position in the food supply chain and adapting supply to market trends. Therefore, Member States should also be able to adopt marketing rules in the wine sector taking into account proposals adopted by recognised producer organisations or by recognised interbranch organisations, when they are representative in the economic area concerned.  In case of market imbalances, Member States are currently authorised to make national payments to wine producers for the voluntary or mandatory distillation of wine. This proposal aims to authorise national payments for voluntary green harvesting and voluntary grubbing up of productive vineyards as additional supply management tools, given the cost-effectiveness to remove surplus wine from the market before it is produced. Limits are set for the overall amount of national payments authorised in a Member State in any given year for distillation and green harvesting to avoid a distortion of competition. For grubbing up, given the structural nature of the measure and its higher costs, the limit for national payments will be set case by case on the basis of the specific market circumstances of the Member State and the wine regions in which it would be implemented.  Aromatised wine products are another important outlet for grapevine products. However, the current legislation does not allow to use the sales denominations reserved for aromatised wine products for beverages which do not reach the minimum alcohol content for each product category. In view of the increasing consumer demand for innovative alcoholic beverages with a lower actual alcoholic strength by volume, it should be allowed to obtain aromatised wine products from de-alcoholised or partially de-alcoholised wines. In order to ensure that consumers are correctly informed of the nature of aromatised wine products with a lower alcoholic content, it is appropriate to lay down rules for the labelling of de-alcoholised or partially de-alcoholised wines, so that those aromatised wine products may use the same descriptive terms in their presentation and labelling as the grapevine products with the corresponding alcoholic strength. To improve the clarity of the information to consumers, the provisions concerning the labelling of the nutrition declaration and the list of ingredients of aromatised wine products by electronic means should be aligned to those applied to grapevine products.  In order to meet new consumer demand and the need for product innovation, the requirements for the aromatised wine product category ‘Glühwein’ are amended to allow the use of rosé wine. At the same time, provisions are made to forbid the use of the term ‘rosé’ in the labelling of a ‘Glühwein’ produced by combining red and white wine or any of those with rosé wine. A labelling derogation is introduced to allow alcoholic beverages produced with the same requirements as those laid down for ‘Glühwein’, but by using fruit wine instead of grapevine products as main ingredient, to use the sales denomination ‘Glühwein’ in their presentation and labelling to meet consumer demand for such products.  In the framework of the CAP Strategic Plans, the restructuring and conversion of vineyards can be supported. In order to strike a balance between the need for Member States to ensure efficient restructuring of vineyards and the need to avoid an increase of production that may lead to oversupply, Member States will be allowed to set conditions for the implementation of the restructuring and conversion type of interventions with the aim to avoid an increase in yield and thus an increase of production for the vineyard subject to this type of interventions.  With a view to developing wine tourism in wine regions with protected designations and protected geographical indications, producer groups managing protected designations of origin and geographical indications can now be beneficiaries of the type of interventions promoting wine tourism in production regions.  Stakeholders and Member States have repeatedly stated that the current maximum duration of three years for the support granted for promotion and communication operations carried out in third countries in relation to consolidation of market outlets is too short to achieve this aim. The maximum duration is therefore extended from three to five years.  To provide an additional incentive for cooperation in the wine sector, certain investments carried out by recognised producer organisations will benefit from the same maximum rate of Union financial assistance as it is currently already the case for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises.  With a view to further supporting producers in respect of climate change mitigation and adaptation, Member States are given the choice to increase the maximum Union financial assistance that can be provided for investments pursuing such objective to up to 80% of the eligible investment costs.  In order to clarify the conditions applicable to Union financial assistance for investments in innovation, it is explicitly stated that no such Union financial assistance is to be granted to enterprises in difficulty within the meaning of the Commission Communication entitled ‘Guidelines on State aid for rescuing and restructuring non-financial undertakings in difficulty’.  2025/0071 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulations (EU) No 1308/2013, (EU) 2021/2115 and (EU) No 251/2014 as regards certain market rules and sectoral support measures in the wine sector and for aromatised wine products  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 42, first subparagraph, and Article 43(2) thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 3 ,  Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions 4 ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) While the U nion remains the global leader in wine production, consumption, and exported value, societal and demographic changes are impacting the amount, quality, and types of wine consumed. Wine consumption in the Union is at its lowest level of the past three decades while tr aditional export markets for Union wines are impacted by a combination of de creasing consumption trends and geopolitical factors, leading to more uncertain ex port patterns. In addition, production is becoming unpredictable, given the wine sector’s vulnerability to climate change. With the resulting oversupply that lead s to a decreas e in prices , winegrowers have less income to invest in their business and low financial reserves they can fall back on , if one of the more frequent and often localised sever e weather events hits their region.  (2) T he High-Level Group on Wine Policy ( ‘ HLG ’ ) was established to discuss the se challenges and to identify possible opportunities for the Union wine sector. It reflected on how to better support the sector in facing current structural challenges by managing the production potential, enhancing competitiveness and exploring new market opportunities. After four meetings, the HLG endorsed a document with policy recommendations 5 .  (3) In order to provide the best possible support to wine producer s facing the above challenges , i t is appropriate to reflect the most urgent recommendations of the HLG in the legal framework applicable to wines and aromatised wine products.  (4) In view of the current d ecline in demand for wine, w inegrowers who hold valid unused authorisations for new plantings and authorisations resulting from the conversion of planting rights granted to them before 1 January 2025 should be allowed to waive these authorisations without incurring an administrative penalty , with a view to remov ing the incentive for planting authorisation holders to plant vineyards where there might be no demand for the wine they will produce. For the new planting authorisation s granted after that date , the administrative penalty should continue to apply in case of non - u se of these authorisations in order to discourage speculative applications from wine growers who do not have the intention to plant a vineyard .  (5) Concerning the management of the production potential, a longer validity period of replanting authorisations should be foreseen to give producers more time to explore the possibility to plant varieties which are better adapted to the market demand or to the changing climatic conditions or to use new vineyard management techniques. Furthermore, to alleviate pressure on winegrowers, they should not face administrative penalties if they decide not to use a replanting authorisation.  (6) Member States should be given the possibility to limit the issuing of new planting authorisations at regional level for specific areas with excess supply where national or Union measures aimed to reduce the supply (i.e. distillation, green harvesting or grubbing up of vineyards ) are or have been implemented in order to avoid further increasing the production potential .  (7) Where a Member State decides to set regional limits for specific area s to avoid an excessive growth of the production potential , it is appropriate to allow that Member State s require that the authorisations gra n ted for the area concerned by the regional limit are used in that area . In order to better take into account recent trends in the wine sector, Member States should have the flexibility to set regional limits for specific areas as low as 0% , in view to adapting the production potential to the market demand.  (8) While the replanting of a grubbed-up vineyard does not increase the vineyard area, Member States should be given the possibility to set rules for replanting in order to better manage the territorial distribution of vineyards , for instance to avoid the relocation of vineyards to regions with a market imbalance or away from slopes and terraces, where they play an important role in the preservation of the landscape and avoid soil erosion. Member States should also be given the possibility to set conditions on the use of varieties and production methods to avoid an increase in yields and to ensure preservation of traditional grape varieties and production methods .  (9) In order to ensure a proportionate approach to the application of the planting authorisations sc h eme while taking into consideration the serious risks that oversupply represents to the market, it is appropriate to establish a maximum threshold of hectares of planted vineyards under which Member States are exempted from the obligation to apply the s cheme of planting authorisations.  (10) In recent years , there has been a n ever-evolving consumer demand for g rapevine products with a reduced alcohol content , which are at present produced by de-alcoholisat i on by using certain techniques allowed in the Union . C onsumers are familiar with t erms such as ’ 0,0% ’ , ‘ alcohol-free ’ and ’ alcohol- light’ , which are widely used but regulated differently in various Member States . It is therefore necessary to harmonise the use of these terms across the Union. The rules on the labelling of wine products should therefore be amended in order to better inform the consumer of the characteristics of grapevine products with a reduced alcohol content, while keeping the obligation to provide information on the production method consisting of a de-alcoholisation . This should allow the Union wine sector to benefit from this development in consumer demand while maintaining high quality production standards .  (11) High c onsumer demand for sparkling wine products with a lower alcohol content or without alcohol represents an opportunity for the sector . However, the current rules for the production of de-alcoholised wines impose certain technological limitations for the production of such wines . According to the rules currently in force , wine products must have reached the characteristics and the min imum alcoholic strength of the corresponding category before undergoing the de-alcoholisation process , which implies that de-alcoholised sparkling wines can be produced only from sparkling wines . However, the de-alcoholisation process removes entirely any CO2 from the initial sparkling wine . Consequently, in order to produce a sparkling wine with lower or no alcoholic content, it is necessary to reintroduce CO2 in the partially or totally de-alcoholised wine that has lost its initial CO2 content, th r ough a new , separate process . Therefore, it should be allowed to produce de-alcoholised sparkling and aerated sparkling wines directly from de-alcoholised or partially de-alcoholi s ed still wines through a second fermentation or the addition of CO2 , respectively .  (12) The possibility to provide the list of ingredients and the nutrition declaration of wine products by electronic means has proven effective for operators for presenting important information to consumers , whi le facilitat ing the functioning of the internal market and wine exports , especially for small producers. However, the absence of harmonised rules on the identification , on the package or the label attached thereto , of the electronic means providing the list of ingredients and /or the nutrition declaration , is causing di verging prac t ices by operators and different rules by national authorities , affect ing the proper market ing of wines . In order to minimise costs and the administrative burden for operators, and to ensure a common approach across the Union market, while taking into account the need to make such information accessible to consumers, t he Commission should be empowered to develop, in cooperation with Member States, rules on the identification on the package or the label attached thereto of the electronic means providing consumers with the list o f ingredients and the nutrition declaration in a harmonised way, including through a language-free system .  (13) The Commission should be empowered to adapt the rules on electronic labelling to new needs arising from the fast and constant progress of digitalisati o n and to accommodate other compulsory or relevant information to consumers that may be presented electronically .  (14) Member States have the possibility to adopt marketing rules to regulate the supply in the wine sector to improve and stabilise the operation of the common wine market. In the current context of structural consumption decrease and recurrent situations of oversupply in certain regions and market segments, it is appropriate to clarify that such rules can include the setting of maximum grape yields and the management of wine stocks. Moreover, producer organisations can play an important role in strengthening the winegrowers’ position in the food supply and in adapting supply to market trends. Therefore, Member States should also be able to adopt marketing rules in the wine sector taking into account proposals adopted by recognised producer organisations or by recognised interbranch organisations, when they are representative in the concerned economic area or areas .  (15) Member States may currently be authorised to make national payments to wine producers for the voluntary or mandatory distillation of wine . Given the cost-effectiveness of removing surplus production from the market before wine is produced, it is appropriate to also provide for the possibility to authorise Member States , in justified cases of crisis, to make national payments for voluntary green harvesting and voluntary grubbing up of productive vineyards . This Regulation should set l imits for the overall amount of national payments authorised in a Member State in any given year for distillation and green harvesting to avoid a distortion of competition. For grubbing up, given the structural nature of the measure and its higher costs, it is not appropriate to set an overall maximum amount of national payments. However, Member States should justify in their notification the limit for national payments case by case on the basis of the ir specific market circumstances and those of the wine regions in which the measure would be implemented .  (16) Aromatised wine products are a natural outlet for grapevine products. However, Regulation (EU) No 251/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council 6 does not allow to use the sales denominations reserved for aromatised wine products for beverages which do not reach the minimum alcohol content laid dow n in that Regulation for each product category. In view of the increasing consumer demand for innovative alcoholic beverages with a lower actual alcoholic strength by volume, it should be allowed t o place on the market beverages obtain ed from de-alcoholised or partially de-alcoholised wines produced in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council 7 bearing in their presentation and labelling sales denominations reserved for aromatised wine products .  (17) In order to ensure that consumers are correctly informed of the nature of aromatised wine products with a lower alcoholic content, it is appropriate to lay down rules in line with those laid down in Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 for the labelling of de-alcoholised or partially de-alcoholised wines , so that aromatised wine products obtained from de-alcoholised or partially de-alcoholised wines are described in their presentation and labelling by the same terms as grapevine products with the corresponding alcoholic strength.  (18) T he issues highlighted above for grapevine products in relation to the identification of the electronic means containing the nutrition declaration and the list of ingredients are valid also for aromatised wine products . T herefore, t he Commission should be empowered to develop, in cooperation with Member States, rules on the identification on the package or the label attached thereto of the electronic means for aromatised wine products . T o ensure simplicity and clarity, these rules should be the same as those applied to grapevine products .  (19) In order to meet new consumer demand s and the need for product innovation, rules on the production and labelling of the aromatised wine product category ‘ Glühwein ’ should be amended to allow for the use of rosé wine. At the same time, the use of the term ‘rosé’ in the presentation and labelling of a Glühwein produced by combining red and white wine or any of those with rosé wine should be prohibited . For the same reasons, it is also appropriate to lay down a derogation allowing alcoholic beverages produced with the same requirements as those laid down for Glühwein but by using as main ingredient fruit wine instead of grapevine products to use the sales denomination Glühwein in its presentation and labelling.  (20) With a view to developing wine tourism in wine regions with protected designations and protected geographical indications, it is appropriate to allow for producer groups managing protected designations of origin and geographical indications in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2024/1143 of the European Parliament and of the Council 8 to be beneficiaries of the type of interventions referred to in Article 58(1), first subparagraph, point (i), of Regulation (EU) 2021/2115 of the European Parliament and of the Council 9 .  (21) In order to strike a balance between the need for Member States to ensure efficient restructuring of vineyards and the need to avoid an increase in production that may lead to oversupply , Member States should be allowed to set up conditions for the implementation of the restructuring and conversion of vineyards as referred to in Article 58(1) , first subparagraph, point (a) , of Regulation (EU) 2021/2115 . These condition s should aim at avoiding an increase in yield and thus an increase in production for the vineyard s subject to th is type of intervention s .  (22) To adapt to market trends and harness efficient market opportunities, the maximum duration of the support for promotion and communication operations carri e d out in third countries in relation to the consolidation of market outlets should be extended from three to five years.  (23) To strengthen cooperation in the wine sector, investments referred to in Article 58(1), first sub paragraph, point (b) , of Regulation (EU) 2021/2115 ca rried out by producer organisations recognised under Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 should benefit from the maximum rate of Union financ ial assistance set out in Article 59(2) of Regulation (EU) 2021/2115 as it is already the case for micro, small and medium - sized enterprises withi n the meaning of Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC 10 .  (24) T o further support pro du cers in respect of climate change mitigation and adaptation, it is pertinent to provide for the possi bility for Member States to increase the maximum Union financial assistance for invest ments pursuing that objective to up to 80% of the eligible investment costs .  (25) Moreover, it is necessary to clarify that the Union financial assistance for innovation referred to in Article 58(1), first subparagraph, point (e), of Regulation (EU) 2021/2115 should n o t be granted to enterprises in difficulty within the meaning of the Commission Communication ‘Guidelines on State aid for rescuing and restructuring non-financial undertakings in difficulty’ as it is the case for Union financial assistance for investments referred to in Article 58(1), first subparagraph, point (b ) , of that Regulation .  (26) Regulations (EU) No 1308/2013, (EU) No 251/2014 and (EU) 2021/2115 should therefore be amended accordingly .  (27) In order to allow time to producers to adapt to the new requirements concerning the designation of grapevine products with a low alcoholic content, those new requirements should start to apply 18 months from the date of entry into force of this R egulation. It is also appropriate to provide transitional rules to allow grapevine product s labelled prior to the application of the new requirements to continue to be placed on the market until stocks are exhausted .  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Article 1 Amendments to Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013  Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 is amended as follows:  (1) Article 62(3) is replaced by the following:  ‘3. The authorisations referred to in paragraph 1, granted in accordance with Articles 64 and 68, shall be valid for three years from the date on which they were granted. A producer who has not used an authorisation granted in accordance with Articles 64 and 68 during its period of validity shall be subject to administrative penalties as provided for in Article 90a(4).  By way of derogation from the first subparagraph, producers who hold valid authorisations in accordance with Articles 64 and 68 granted before 1 January 2025 shall not be subject to the administrative penalty referred to in Article 90a(4) provided that they inform the competent authorities before the date of expiry of the authorisation and at the latest by 31 December 2026 that they do not intend to make use of their authorisation.  Authorisations granted in accordance with Article 66 on replantings shall be valid for eight years from the date on which they were granted. Producers who have not used an authorisation granted in accordance with Article 66 during its period of validity shall not be subject to the administrative penalty referred to in Article 90a(4).’  (2) Article 63 is amended as follows:  (a) paragraph 2 is replaced by the following:  ‘2.

FRAMEWORK OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE  1.1. Title of the proposal/initiative  Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL amending Regulations (EU) No 1308/2013, (EU) 2021/2115 and (EU) No 251/2014 as regards certain market rules and sectoral support measures in the wine sector and for aromatised wine products.  1.2. Policy area(s) concerned  Programme cluster 8 - Agriculture & Maritime Policy under Heading 3 of the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) 2021-2027.  1.3. Objective(s)  1.3.1. General objective(s)  In order to address structural challenges faced by the European wine sector, the objective of the proposal is to enhance the sector’s competitiveness and resilience, preserve the economic importance of the EU wine sector and its social relevance, particularly helping maintain the vitality of many rural areas.  1.3.2. Specific objective(s)  The proposal aims at providing long-lasting policy tools to support Member States and the wine sector to achieve the following specific objectives:  1) Address the management of the production potential.  2) Increase the resilience of the EU wine sector against climate change and tensions of shifting markets  3) Adapt the sector to market trends and help it harness new market opportunities  1.3.3. Expected result(s) and impact  The main expected results are:  – The EU wine sector continues to lead globally the wine market  – The balance between the wine production potential and the trends in demand from the domestic and international markets is re-established.  – Member States are able to adopt measures to address challenges and difficulties with enhanced flexibility.  – Farmers and producer organisations benefit for a more flexible policy framework for taking decisions aligned with the market trends.  – The EU wine sector improves its capacity to improve its position in emerging and new markets, and to diversify sources of income.  – The EU wine sector is able to better confront the uncertainties affecting the market, including climate change.  1.3.4. Indicators of performance  The proposal does not affect the CAP monitoring framework.  1.4. The proposal/initiative relates to:   a new action   a new action following a pilot project / preparatory action 11   the extension of an existing action   a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action  1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative  1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative  The current proposal responds to the most urgent and specific recommendations endorsed by the High Level Group (HLG) on wine policy in December 2024, by amending the existing legal framework to the extent necessary to contribute to achieve the defined objectives. The proposal, once adopted, will allow Member States and the wine sector take action quickly, bringing relief to the many challenges confronted.  The modifications proposed might be further supplemented in future policy reforms, to give response to some additional recommendations that are not sector specific or cannot be implemented within the current context.  1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, greater effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this section 'added value of EU involvement' is the value resulting from EU action, that is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.  The cross-border and global nature of key challenges faced by the EU wine sector and the wide regulatory framework the wine is subject to in the EU require a common response at the EU level, securing the functioning of the single market and the level playing field established by the CAP.  1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past  N/A  1.5.4. Compatibility with the multiannual financial framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments  The proposal does not affect the multiannual financial framework and does not change the current CAP budget or the distribution of budget between the two pillars, or the design of measures under the two pillars.  1.5.5. Assessment of the different available financing options, including scope for redeployment  Any CAP related expenditure will remain within the enevelopes of the National Support Programmes for the wine sector. Other measures may be financed with national funds.  1.6.

Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities  No changes are foreseen with respect to the status quo.  3. ESTIMATED FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE  3.1. Heading(s) of the multiannual financial framework and expenditure budget line(s) affected  This proposal does not have any quantifiable budgetary impact.  In line with the recommendations of the HLG on wine, the proposal includes measures aiming at managing the production potential, enhancing competitiveness and exploring new market opportunities of the sector.  Some measures (listed under Point 5 Detailed explanation of the specific provision of the proposal) may accelerate the implementation and consequently increase the expenditure of the wine budget, but any related expenditure will remain under the Member States financial allocations for the wine sector.  The proposal contains provisions giving Member States a degree of flexibility to increase the Union financial assistance for certain types of interventions and beneficiaries, in the framework of the CAP Strategic Plans. Thus, producer groups managing protected designations of origin and geographical indications can now be beneficiaries of the type of interventions promoting wine tourism in production regions. The maximum duration of the support for promotion and communication operations carried out in third countries is extended from three to five years. Certain investments carried out by recognised producer organisations will benefit from the same maximum rate of support as it is already the case for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises. Member States may increase the support rate for investments on climate change mitigation and adaptation.  The impact of the flexibilities introduced in the policy framework cannot be quantified at this stage.  – Existing budget lines  In order of multiannual financial framework headings and budget lines.

Data  Table: Row 1 — The proposed provisions provide: a) an empowerment to the Commission to issue rules supplementing existing rules on electronic labelling of certain mandatory information from operators to consumers in the wine sector (article 1(6)). Personal data protection is already considered in the regulation in force and is not under the scope of this regulation; b) the alignment of the provisions concerning the electronic labelling of the nutrition declaration and the list of ingredients of aromatised wine products to those applied to grapevine products (article 2(3)). Alignment with the European Data Strategy In line with the EU strategy for data, the delegated power for electronic labelling of grapevine and wine products will harmonise terms and rules on the identification of information by electronic means to consumers, which will ensure a common approach across the Union market. Ultimately, such approach will allow labels to flow within the EU for the benefit of citizens and consumers. The specific elements concerning the alignment with the European Data Strategy should be assessed case by case whenever the empowerment would be used. Alignment with the once-only principle Not applicable. Public administrations are not concerned. Data flows Not applicable.  4.3. Digital solutions  Table: Row 1 — Digital solution : provision of empowerment concerning mandatory labelling information presented by electronic means. Ref. to requirements: Article 1(6) The Commission may develop delegated acts to establish a common identification on the package or the label of grapevine products of the electronic means that provide mandatory information to consumers, as well as to adapt the rules on electronic labelling to future technological progress if needed (e.g. increased requirements on provision of electronic information between operators or from operators to consumers). New rules would thus improve accessibility and understandability of digital labels across the EU, reducing the costs for operators and increasing clarity for consumers. Body responsible: European Commission (for the empowerment); the economic operators (for implementation). Digital solution : provision allowing the labelling of mandatory information by electronic means. Ref. to requirements: Article 2(3) The rules on identification of the electronic means for aromatised wine products would be aligned with those of the wine sector, with a single system across sectors. Main mandated rules in force for wine that would be mirrored: operators can provide certain mandatory information (list of ingredients, nutrition declaration) on the physical label or by electronic means identified on the package or on a label attached thereto. The system must avoid any collection or tracking of user data and must not provide information aimed at marketing purposes. Body responsible: the economic operator. At present, the policy initiative does not foresee the use of AI technologies for the identified digital solution.  4.4. Interoperability assessment  Table: Row 1 — The requirements set by the policy initiative do not concern digital public services.  4.5. Measures to support digital implementation  Table: Row 1 — Article 1(6): The Commission shall adopt delegated acts, when it will be deemed necessary (not within a specific timeline). Member States shall be involved. Article 2(3): the provision simply extends to aromatised wines the rules on electronic labelling applied to wine. Member States shall be involved. Operators shall implement the rules.",,,,,,,"The European Commission has proposed a legislative amendment aimed at revitalizing the European wine sector, which is grappling with challenges such as declining consumption, climate change impacts, and uncertain export markets. The proposal seeks to amend existing regulations to better manage wine production, enhance competitiveness, and explore new market opportunities. Key changes include allowing Member States to manage vine planting authorizations more effectively to prevent surplus production, introducing new labeling rules for wines with lower alcohol content, and providing flexibility for vineyard restructuring to prevent market imbalances.

To support producers in adapting to climate change, the proposal allows Member States to increase financial assistance for investments in climate change mitigation and adaptation to up to 80% of eligible costs, excluding enterprises in financial difficulty. It also extends the validity of replanting authorizations to eight years, abolishes administrative penalties for unused replanting authorizations, and allows winegrowers to renounce unused authorizations granted before January 1, 2025, without penalty.

The proposal gives Member States the ability to set regional limits on new planting authorizations in areas with excess supply, with flexibility to set these limits as low as 0% to adapt production to market demand. It also allows Member States to set conditions on the use of grape varieties and production methods to avoid yield increases and preserve traditional practices. A maximum threshold of hectares of planted vineyards is proposed, below which Member States are exempt from applying the planting authorizations scheme, addressing oversupply risks.

In line with the EU strategy for data"

CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  The central theme of this European Commission mandate is to create a competitive European economy. The Competitiveness Compass provides us with the vision of Europe as an economic powerhouse, an attractive investment destination, and a manufacturing centre. The Savings and Investments Union (SIU) is one of the five horizontal enablers of the Compass.  Europe faces vast investment needs in strategic sectors such as defence, space, biotech, cleantech, and artificial intelligence. Too often, the absence of sufficient risk capital forces innovators to rely on foreign investors, or to relocate abroad. When this happens, Europe loses not just businesses, but also indirectly jobs, innovative capacity, and the ability to build and sustain a competitive advantage in the economic sectors of the future.  The need to act urgently has been widely recognised at the highest political level. In 2024, at the request of the European Council and the President of the European Commission respectively, Enrico Letta and Mario Draghi delivered landmark reports, each recommending measures to improve capital market integration and efficient supervision so as to restore the competitiveness of the EU economy and meet the geopolitical challenges it is facing. In addition, the Eurogroup, the European Council, have also urged progress to create truly integrated European capital markets which are accessible to all citizens and businesses across the Union. This is a shared objective among all European institutions and has widespread support throughout European capitals.  The Euro Summit of March 2025 emphasised the urgency and shared responsibility for rapid progress on creating the SIU. The European Parliament has argued that capital markets integration is a necessary pillar of the Union's investment strategy and supports the Commission's intention to propose measures to strengthen supervisory convergence tools and achieve more unified direct supervision of capital markets. The European Central Bank (ECB) has also been vocal in its support for the project.  Beyond Europe, international organisations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), have called for action to address the remaining barriers to EU financial market integration. Interconnecting national financial markets across the EU brings clear and tangible benefits. It unlocks cross-border capital flows, making investment more efficient while deepening liquidity and reducing costs for businesses and investors. It strengthens financial resilience by spreading risks across a wider pool of instruments and markets, and it spurs innovation and competition, leading to better products and services for citizens.  To support the objectives of the SIU, this proposal calls for converting Directive 98/26/EC (the Settlement Finality Directive or SFD) into a Regulation. The SFD, adopted in 1998, aims to reduce systemic risk in payment systems and securities settlement systems within the EU by ensuring the finality and irrevocability of transfer orders once entered into a designated system, even in the event of a participant’s insolvency. It provides legal certainty around the timing and enforceability of settlement, netting, and collateral arrangements, thereby safeguarding the smooth functioning of financial markets. The SFD also establishes common rules for the designation of systems and the protection of collateral posted in connection with participation in such systems and clarifies which law applies in certain cross-border operations. While the scope of the SFD is limited to systems governed by the laws of a Member State, Member States may extend SFD-like protections to domestic entities that participate in third-country systems.  Since its adoption in 1998, the SFD has been amended six times to reflect the evolving structure of EU financial markets. The first amendment, 1 in 2009, extended settlement finality protections to credit claims and to links between payment and securities settlement systems. The second, 2 introduced in 2010, aligned the Directive 3 with the creation of the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs), clarifying the roles of EU and national supervisors. The third, 4 in 2012, introduced updates to ensure consistency with the new EU framework for central counterparties and trade repositories. The fourth, 5 in 2014, adjusted definitions and references to align the SFD with the EU’s harmonised securities settlement regime. The fifth, 6 in 2019, refined provisions relating to third-country participants and system interoperability to ensure continuity in the event of bank resolution. Most recently, in 2024, the sixth amendment 7 expanded the scope of eligible participants to include non-bank payment service providers, modernising the framework to reflect changes in EU retail payment infrastructure.  In 2023, the Commission published a Report on the review of the Settlement Finality Directive. At that time, the Report concluded that the SFD works well and that no major overhaul of the Directive is necessary. Nevertheless, the Commission noted the impact of new technologies, lack of legal certainty that generates additional costs for market participants and differences in transposition of SFD provisions by Member States that creates difficulties and costs in cross-border situations.  Nevertheless, the SFD has played a central role in ensuring stability and legal certainty for payments and securities settlement systems in the EU by protecting transfer orders and netting arrangements from the effects of insolvency. However, its national transposition has resulted in significant divergences that undermine its effectiveness in fostering a coherent and integrated European post-trade landscape. Member States have adopted different approaches to the designation of systems, creating inconsistencies in the scope of protection available to participants. Similarly, the definitions and treatment of participants and indirect participants vary widely, leading to uncertainty over who benefits from settlement finality protections. There are also differences in the types of securities that qualify for protection, with some jurisdictions applying narrow interpretations that limit coverage, while others adopt broader criteria.  Further inconsistencies relate to the moment of settlement finality, where Member States differ in determining the precise point at which transfer orders become irrevocable and protected from insolvency proceedings – an issue that is especially problematic for cross-border settlements involving multiple systems. Divergent conflict-of-law rules and the treatment of EU entities participating in third-country systems further complicate matters, creating uncertainty about which legal regime governs finality in multi-jurisdictional transactions. In addition, designation practices and levels of transparency vary across Member States, with some providing limited public information about designated systems and their participants, hindering legal clarity and market confidence. These divergences collectively weaken the harmonising intent of the SFD, introduce legal and operational risks for cross-border settlement, and hamper the efficiency and integration of EU financial markets. Furthermore, both the SFD and related provisions in Directive 2002/47/EC (the Financial Collateral Directive or FCD) lack full technological neutrality, as their provisions were drafted with traditional, account-based systems in mind. This creates legal uncertainty for the use of distributed ledger technology (DLT) and tokenised forms of cash or securities, which may not clearly fall within existing definitions of ‘transfer orders’, ‘securities’, or ‘settlement systems’, thereby limiting innovation and consistency in their application.  Converting the SFD into a Regulation and updating definitions of key concepts would enhance legal certainty, consistency, and market integration across the EU. The Regulation also aims to ensure sufficient technological neutrality to help support the implementation of new technologies, such as DLT, to bring efficient solutions to the market while ensuring that risks are appropriately mitigated. Moreover, further harmonisation would align with broader EU initiatives such as the Capital Markets Union and the Savings and Investment Union, fostering investor confidence and improving the resilience and competitiveness of the post-trade ecosystem.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  The proposal converts the SFD into a Regulation (the Settlement Finality Regulation or SFR). To achieve this objective, the proposal sets out in a more precise way matters related to protections granted by the SFD to achieve a harmonised approach across the EU. This relates, in particular to: (i) legal certainty for digital innovation; (ii) conflict-of-law rules; (iii) participation of EU entities in third-country systems; (iv) the scope of participants; (v) the scope of eligible securities; (vi) designation practices for EU systems; (vii) transparency; and (viii) settlement finality moments.  As the payment and settlement of securities transactions lies at the core of the capital markets, the proposed legislative changes would contribute to the development of a safer and more efficient post-trading landscape in the EU, in line with the objectives of the SIU. In addition, the SFR, by clarifying definitions and scope with respect to the provisions contained therein, would support innovation and the uptake of new technologies. Overall, the SFR would reduce the systemic risk associated with participation in payment and securities settlement systems, and particularly the risk linked to insolvency of a participant in such systems. Well-functioning payment systems and securities settlement systems such as those operated by central securities depositories (CSDs) ensure that payments and securities transactions can be made safely and with certainty. This is an important foundation for the financial sector and thus for the SIU. In this way, the SFR is complementary to other regulations making up the post-trade environment, i.e. the CSDR, the FCD, and EMIR.  • Consistency with other Union policies  This initiative aims to complement the broader Commission agenda to make EU capital markets more competitive and resilient. A competitive and efficient post-trade environment, of which settlement and payment systems are a pivotal feature, is an essential element to achieve the SIU objectives. A fully functioning and integrated market for capital will allow the EU’s economy to grow in a sustainable way and be more competitive, in line with the strategic priorities of the Commission, focused on creating the right conditions for job creation, growth and investment.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) confers to the European Parliament and the Council the competence to adopt measures for the approximation of the provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States which relate to the establishment and functioning of the internal market. Article 114 of the TFEU allows the EU to take measures not only to eliminate current obstacles to the exercise of the fundamental freedoms, but to prevent such obstacles from emerging, including those that make it difficult for economic operators, including investors, to take full advantage of the benefits of the internal market.  Currently, effective solutions to ensure cross-border provision of services in these sectors are either absent or hindered by varying national rules implementing EU legal acts. Moreover, EU rules need updating to better facilitate financial services provision using new technologies, in particular DLT, that can enhance capital market efficiency. Divergences in Member State transposition of the SFD exacerbate these issues.  This proposal supports the correct and safe functioning of the single market, safeguard competition and preserve incentives for innovation. Consequently, the appropriate legal basis is Article 114 TFEU.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  According to the principle of subsidiarity provided in Article 5(3) of the TFEU, action at Union level should be taken only when the envisaged aims cannot be achieved sufficiently by Member States alone and can, because of the scale of effects of the proposed actions, be better achieved by the EU.  The SFD aims to reduce systemic risk arising from insolvency of participants in payment and securities settlement systems. It does so by stipulating protections for the irrevocability and finality of transfer orders entered into a payment or settlement system. The transposition of the SFD was left to Member States, leading to divergent application and interpretation across the settlement and payment systems designated in the EU. This creates frictions in cross-border operations and undermines the integration of the EU capital market.  Converting the SFD into a Regulation will allow for a more consistent and homogeneous approach across the EU.  • Proportionality  T he proposed conversion of the SFD into a Regulation – together with the targeted amendments to its substantive provisions – should be regarded as proportionate and necessary to help achieve the objectives of the SIU. Fragmentation and divergences in the application of settlement finality rules across Member States has long been a barrier to cross-border financial activity. Divergent transpositions of key definitions and concepts, inconsistent national practices in system designation and determining the moment of finality create legal uncertainty and additional operational and legal risk in cross-border operations. A Regulation would directly harmonise these rules, ensuring consistent application across the Union and facilitating smoother, more predictable financial operations. In this way, the proposal supports one of the core goals of the SIU, that of a more integrated and efficient single market for savings and investment.  As a Regulation, settlement finality provisions would not impose disproportionate burdens on market participants or authorities. Instead, a Regulation would eliminate duplicative legal and compliance efforts that currently arise from having to navigate 27 disparate transpositions and interpretations of the SFD. The legal uniformity achieved via a Settlement Finality Regulation would simplify participation in multiple systems, reduce costs linked to legal due diligence, and enhance legal certainty, especially in cross-border situations and in the case of participation in third-country systems. Finally, amendments linked to ensuring technological neutrality would allow for greater legal certainty in the case that systems and assets are underpinned by new technologies, decreasing the need for costly legal work to ensure regulatory compliance.  • Choice of the instrument  The SFD allows for national transposition, which has led to divergent interpretations and applications among Member States – particularly concerning the designation of systems, the scope of protection for collateral, and the treatment of cross-border participants. The divergent national approaches cause legal uncertainty, prevent market integration and inhibit cross-border transactions. A Regulation would be directly applicable, eliminating these discrepancies and ensuring that the same rules apply uniformly across the Union. This would reduce legal risk and complexity for market participants operating in multiple jurisdictions, support more efficient cross-border settlement and interoperability between systems. It is thus appropriate and necessary to repeal the SFD and replace it with a Regulation.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  In 2023 the Commission published a review 8 of settlement finality in payment and securities settlement systems including its application to domestic institutions participating in third-country systems. Although the review concluded that the SFD worked well and no major overhaul seemed warranted, it also pointed out that impacts of new technology as well as the lack of legal certainty in certain areas led to potential additional costs for financial market participants. It also noted that a lower level of harmonisation leaves considerable discretion in transposition and implementation to Member States and may create difficulties in cross-border situations.  • Stakeholder consultations  The Commission has consulted stakeholders throughout the process of preparing this proposal, in particular:  · A public consultation 9 on the operation of the SFD, which was organised between 12 February 2021 and 7 May 2021. 72 stakeholders replied to the targeted consultation. The lack of harmonisation and legal certainty as to how Member State insolvency rules apply to EU participants in third-country systems was raised by many respondents . There was also a general agreement to add CSDs to the list of eligible (direct) participants in systems governed by the law of a Member State.  · A stakeholder workshop 10 on identifying and addressing barriers to integration of market infrastructure and scaling up of investment funds in the EU on 26 September 2024. The event included a panel on post-trading, which explored the potential benefits and challenges of post-trade consolidation as well as the regulatory landscape.  · A targeted consultation 11 on integration of EU capital markets was organised between 15 April 2025 and 10 June 2025. Regarding the SFD, some respondents considered that the Directive work ed well, and no modifications we re necessary, except for some clarifications regarding its application to DLT-based systems. However, other respondents supported converting the SFD into a Regulation to tackle inconsistent implementation of the SFD across the EU. Respondents also highlighted the need for clearer guidance on the conflict of law rules, as well as to tackle uncertainty regarding the protection of indirect participants and the extension of protection to participants in third-country systems and to DLT-based systems. Several respondents noted that the current SFD framework wa s too narrow and that a more comprehensive approach would be beneficial (e.g. broadening the scope of eligible participants). Some respondents suggested that SFD protection should be extended to activities in relation to any assets, not just cash and securities, and that the definition of ‘ system ’ should be broadened to include more types of systems . In addition, some respondents indicated that the information about each designated system should be published so that settlement finality moments within the SFD would be harmonised, and clearer definitions of ‘ collateral security ’ and ‘ financial collateral ’ in the FCD should be provided. The misalignment of these definitions was mentioned by more than half of respondents as creating complexities for efficient collateral management.  • Collection and use of expertise  In preparing the proposal the Commission relied on external expertise and data from the following sources:  · The Advisory Group on Market Infrastructures for Securities and Collateral (AMI-SeCo) 12 published in September 2025 a report 13 on remaining barriers to integration in securities post-trade services. The report notes that although EU regulatory measures ha ve dismantled barriers (including finality issues), frictions remain due to differing national implementations or interpretations.  · A study on reducing fragmentation in post-trading infrastructures in Europe, commissioned 14 by the European Commission in September 2024. The study 15 was based on publicly available information and data but also included 98 structured interviews with 76 institutions from 21 European countries, including financial market infrastructures, market participants and supervisory and policy bodies. The study notes the definition of settlement finality as one of the areas where Member States divergence in interpretation and implementation act s as a barrier to capital market integration. Furthermore, the study recommends converting the SFD into a Regulation as it would ensure uniform application of settlement finality rules, reduce legal risk and strengthen the foundation of interoperable, consolidated market infrastructures.  • Impact assessment  The proposal is supported by an Impact Assessment, specifically the sectoral annex on post-trade (Annex 8) to the Impact Assessment accompanying the initiative on market integration and supervision in EU capital markets.  With regards to potential amendments to the SFD, the Impact Assessment considered three options:  · Option 1 – Do nothing;  · Option 2 – Comprehensive review of the SFD to enhance the functioning of market infrastructure;  · Option 3 – Extensive review of the SFD to impose an integrated market.  Option 2 and Option 3 assume that the SFD would be converted into a Regulation. The options however differ with respect to the scope of the protections that would have been granted by the SFR. The modalities that make up Option 2 and Option 3 are explained below:  Table: Row 1 — ; Option 2; Option 3 Row 2 — Legal certainty for digital innovation; Changes to definitions and concepts, i.e. ‘system’, ‘participant’ and ‘institution’, to make them DLT compatible and thus to allow certain DLT-based systems to benefit from settlement finality protections.; All the provisions of Option 2, plus expanding legal certainty to other aspects of holding of securities, as well as further harmonising the designation of systems where they are operated by using DLT. Row 3 — Applicable rules to conflict-of-law; Clarify conflict-of-law rules existing in SFD so that they can be directly applied, including in the context of DLT-based systems and tokenised securities.; The applicable conflict-of-law rule would be governed by the Hague Convention on the applicable law to certain rights in respect of securities held with an intermediary. Row 4 — Participation of EU entities in third-country systems; Harmonised requirements for the registration of third-country systems and introduction of a central access point (ESMA 16 and EBA 17 ). EU credit institutions, investment firms, public authorities or publicly guaranteed undertakings participating in third-country systems registered in the EU benefit from settlement finality protections. Registration would be done by Member States for their respective Member State. No EU wide registration.; Harmonised requirements for the registration of third-country systems and central access point. The responsibility for registering third-country systems would be given to ESMA (for securities settlement systems) and the ECB/ESCB 18 (for payment systems), leading to an EU wide registration. Row 5 — Scope of participants; Expand the list of participants of a system to all legal entities that comply with certain conditions in settlement finality rules and in the rulebook of the system.; Any entity allowed by a system operator to participate in the system would be considered a participant. This would require amendments to other legislation, including the CSDR, to ensure alignment. Row 6 — Scope of eligible securities; A common definition of eligible securities.; Operators of designated systems could choose the instruments that would be included in the protections provided. Row 7 — Designation practices for EU systems; Harmonised requirements for the EU designation of systems and streamline designation practices, in particular with respect to the type of information to provide in a notification, assessment criteria or applicable timelines.; ESMA (for securities settlement systems) and the ECB/ESCB (for payment systems) would be responsible for the assessment and designation of EU systems on an EU wide basis. Row 8 — Transparency; Member States to provide ESMA with up-to-date information on designated EU systems, which would be made publicly available. The scope of information to be provided under Option 2 would also be expanded.; Information on SFR-designated systems to be made public in a centralised form. There would be harmonised reporting to ESMA, including on designated systems, rules and participants, as well as third-country systems that benefit from domestic participant protections. Unrestricted access would be granted by ESMA to information on insolvency proceedings against participants of any designated EU system. Row 9 — Settlement finality moments; The SFR would determine the moments of entry and irrevocability of transfer orders into a system, and potentially the moment of finality of the execution of transfer orders.; All three settlement finality moments would be harmonised at EU level, uniformly for all types of systems.  The Impact Assessment concluded that Option 2 is the option that best addresses the identified barriers, while ensuring proportionality, effectiveness and coherence of the proposed solutions. The option to do nothing (Option 1) would not resolve any of the identified problems, rather leaving them to bottom-up industry or Member State initiatives. This would not remove existing barriers to market integration, with persistent differing national transpositions generating additional costs for market participants when operating cross-border. At the same time the Impact Assessment considered that although the flexibility provided by the SFD under Option 1 can help mitigate lack of harmonisation/ Member State differences in insolvency, corporate or securities laws frameworks, it would not make up for the costs associated with existing barriers to market integration.  Table: Row 1 — ; Option 2; Option 3 Row 2 — Legal certainty for digital innovation; Uniform SFR protection for the system from the insolvency of EU participants irrespective of the technology provided that all SFR requirements are met. Reduced supervision costs. Facilitating innovation via clarity in SFR application.; The additional measures, i.e. to explicitly recognise digital tokens or ledger entries as carrying the same (or comparable) legal rights as traditional securities, potentially by developing an optional EU-level legal framework for digital securities (i.e. a 28th regime), go beyond the scope of the SFR and would warrant consideration as part of the SIU reflections on a 28th regime, in line with what suggested by stakeholders. Row 3 — Applicable rules to conflict-of-law; Increased legal certainty in case of cross-border securities transactions. Savings for market participants in legal opinions and compliance costs. These benefits would extend to DLT-based systems.; Increased legal certainty and lower compliance costs. Market fragmentation would remain and would negatively impact overall protection of the system. This would not support market integration and efficiency. Row 4 — Participation of EU entities in third-country systems; Level playing field. Lower costs for EU participants of collateral requirements required by third-country systems to which they participate.; Maximum harmonisation, ease of compliance thanks to empowerments to ESMA/EBA/ESCB. This would require a substantial increase of resources for these entities. Hence potential delays and costs. Row 5 — Scope of participants; Harmonised scope of protection across Member States. Costs limited to Member States needing to amend their legislation, if necessary (Member State to expand the protection beyond the scope of the Regulation).; Support for innovation, but less certainty about participation in a system. Market fragmentation. Unlevel playing field between operators of DLT-based and systems that do not use DLT. Row 6 — Scope of eligible securities; Reduced market fragmentation and reduced costs of cross-border transactions. Costs limited to Member States needing to amend their legislation, if necessary (Member State to expand the protection beyond the scope of the Regulation).; Support for innovation, but less certainty about participation in a system. Market fragmentation. Unlevel playing field between operators of DLT-based and systems that do not use DLT. Row 7 — Designation practices for EU systems; Level playing field, easier cross-border settlement and reduced fragmentation. By expanding to DLT-based systems, also support for innovation. Some costs for Member States, as they would have to adjust their designation processes.; Greatest possible harmonisation. Market integration. Costs and delays for ESMA/EBA/ESCB to build necessary competencies and infrastructure. Row 8 — Transparency; Reduced market fragmentation, increased legal certainty and easier risk monitoring. Greater trust in designated systems, including DLT-based systems. Cross-border activity, further market integration and scale effects. Cost for publishing the additional information limited for system operators, but slightly higher for ESMA due to additional quality checks.; Transparency on additional elements would unlikely provide additional benefits in terms of competition, trust or risk management. Row 9 — Settlement finality moments; Reduced fragmentation. Interoperability, easier set-up of CSD links and greater cross-border settlement.; Full harmonisation – without taking into account system specificities – is detrimental to efficiency of a system. Costly application in a DLT setting, requiring additional safeguards.  Based on the above analysis it was deemed that Option 2 would overall be more effective, efficient and coherent than Option 3, even if Option 3 would, by bringing even greater harmonisation of settlement finality provisions, be superior to Option 2 in improving supervision and reducing divergencies. In conclusion, Option 2 is the preferred Option as it is coherent with the objectives of the SIU, while also being more proportionate and cost-effective. It will also promote a more integrated, efficient, and innovative EU capital market. Option 2 helps reduce fragmentation and promotes a more harmonised market, which is in line with the broader goals of the SIU.  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  Converting the SFD into a Regulation simultaneously fulfils the objectives of simplifying existing EU law, cutting red tape and making it easier to comply with.  The SFR would enhance legal certainty and consistency for market participants. Furthermore, by ensuring technology neutrality, users of DLT would be able to test and bring to market new technologies without unnecessary costs. The SFR would also eliminate the discrepancies in interpretation caused by national implementation. This would reduce legal risk and compliance complexity for market participants operating in multiple jurisdictions. Lastly, fostering investor confidence and improving the resilience and competitiveness of the post-trade ecosystem would contribute to the efficiency of EU capital markets and indirectly the competitiveness of the EU economy.  SMEs would not be directly impacted by this proposal as the large majority of firms active in the provision of infrastructure (trading and post-trading services) are large, well-established companies. However, via efficiency gains and increased competition in capital market services, non-financial SMEs would benefit via easier and cheaper access to market financing, including for financing innovation and growth. This positive effect should also apply to SMEs using exclusively bank-based financing as this financing channel stands in competition with capital-market based financing.  In terms of costs, clarity on the application of the SFR would reduce costs for system operators as it would decrease the need to seek legal advice on rule interpretation and to comply with local idiosyncrasies. Lastly, formalising the DLT regime and expanding the scope of eligible assets and volume thresholds would make the regime more attractive. Market participants would be able to engage in long-term planning and extend operations beyond small testing scales. Harmonisation and targeted changes to the SFD would furthermore allow for designations (and protection) under the settlement finality rulebook for DLT-based systems. Overall, the changes should promote innovation by increasing the potential returns of investments and by providing increased legal certainty for DLT-based innovations.  • Fundamental rights  The EU is committed to high standards of protection of fundamental rights and is signatory to a broad set of conventions on human rights. In this context, the proposal is not likely to have a direct impact on these rights, as listed in the main United Nations conventions on human rights, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which is an integral part of the EU Treaties, and the European Convention on Human Rights.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  The proposal will have budgetary implications according to the financial statement in Annex 2.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  This proposal does not require an implementation plan.  The monitoring of settlement and payment systems is also the task of ESMA, EBA and the ESCB, which are mandated to provide the Commission with a report on the functioning of the settlement finality regime within 5 years of entry into force of the SFR.  The proposal for the SFR mandates the Commission to prepare a report to the European Parliament and the Council assessing the application of the Regulation, together with amendments, if justified.  • Explanatory documents (for directives)  N/A  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  Article 1(2) specifies the articles of this Regulation that apply to participants established in the Union when they participate to registered systems.  Article 2 defines several terms and concepts necessary to interpret the provisions of the Regulation, including ‘settlement’, ‘clearing’, ‘clearing system’, ‘central counterparty’, ‘clearing house’, ‘participant’, ‘indirect participant’, ‘client’, ‘book entry’, ‘netting’, ‘account’, ‘collateral’, ‘business day’ and ‘working day’.  Article 3 clarifies that the operator of a system governed by the law of a Member State, irrespective of the currency in which it provides for the settlement, clearing or execution of transfer orders, may apply for designation. Furthermore, a competent authority may, on grounds of systemic risk, designate an existing system for the settlement, clearing and execution of instructions related to instruments other than the ones already covered by the system.  In order to provide uniform designation conditions and a harmonised procedure, Article 4 explains the procedure for granting and refusing the designation of a system. In this case, the competent authority is the one in the Member State whose law governs the system. In particular, the Article specifies the time available for the competent authority to accept or reject an application for designating a system and the assessment period to grant or refuse the designation. Similarly, Article 5 specifies the conditions for designating a system. ESMA, in close cooperation with the ESCB, may develop draft regulatory technical standards to further specify these conditions (for settlement and clearing systems). A similar provision applies to EBA for payment systems.  Article 6 explains that a competent authority shall notify ESMA it has designated a system. Furthermore, to harmonise the information to be made publicly available, Article 6 lists the elements this notification should contain. ESMA shall publish the system designation, as well as any updates to the information that made up the notification, without undue delay on its website.  Article 7 specifies who can qualify as participants to a designated system. It also explains under what conditions (systemic risk) Member States may consider an indirect participant to be a participant. Article 7 asks the system operator to establish non-discriminatory, transparent and objective admission criteria to a designated system.  Article 8 tasks the operator of a designated system for its and the system’s compliance with the provisions of this Regulation. It is to notify  the competent authority, without delay, of any material changes affecting the operator’s and the system’s compliance with this Regulation.  Article 9 specifies the conditions under which a competent authority may withdraw, with the involvement of the national competent authority, the designation of a system. It also explains the involvement of ESMA, EBA and the ESCB in the process of withdrawing a designation. The competent authority shall inform without delay, the system operator, the national competent authority, ESMA, EBA and the ESCB of the withdrawal of the designation.  Article 10 requires each Member State to appoint one or more competent authorities, in particular for the designation of systems and the registration of third-country systems.  Article 11 explains the rules and responsibilities associated with the exchange of information between competent authorities, national competent authorities, ESMA, EBA and the ESCB in the exercise of duties under the Regulation.  Article 12 deals with the registration of third-country systems that wish to be registered in one or several Member States. Such a request shall be submitted to ESMA and disseminated to registering authorities. If a participant to a third-country system is established in a Member State, the registering authority of that Member State may register the system.  Article 13 defines the procedure for granting and refusing registration. It specifies the registration process, the duration of the assessment and the methods of communication with the system operator of a third-country system. It also mandates ESMA for clearing and settlement systems) and EBA (for payment systems), in close cooperation with the ESCB, to develop draft regulatory standards to specify the information to be provided in the application for designation and in the application for registration, as well as implementing technical standards to define the uniform electronic formats for the application for designation and the application for registration.  Article 14 sets out the conditions for registration of third-country systems.  Article 15 explains the notification of registered systems and requests ESMA to publish on its website, within 2 working days from the registering authority’s notification of the decision to register the third-country system.  Article 16 defines the conditions under which a registering authority may withdraw the registration of a system.  Article 17 provides that transfer orders and netting, including close-out netting provision, shall be legally enforceable and binding on third parties, even in the event of insolvency proceedings against a participant, provided that transfer orders were entered into the system before the moment of opening of such insolvency proceedings.  Article 18 determines how the moment of entry of a transfer order into designated systems, including interoperable systems, should be determined.  Article 19 provides that the opening of insolvency proceedings against a participant or a system operator of an interoperable system shall not prevent funds or financial instruments available on the settlement account or on accounts holding collateral of that participant or system operator of an interoperable system from being used to fulfil that participant’s obligations in the designated system, or registered system, or in an interoperability arrangement on the business day of the opening of the insolvency proceedings.  Article 20 defines the moment of irrevocability of a transfer order to facilitate the application of insolvency law to transfer orders that have been entered into a system.  Article 21 defines the moment of settlement finality, i.e. the moment when the discharge of the respective obligations of the parties to a transaction are completed in an unconditional and irrevocable manner. This aims to ensure the highest possible degree of consistency regarding settlement finality protection across systems and in turn facilitate cross-border activity. The rules of each designated system shall determine the specific moment where settlement shall be final within the system in accordance with the appliable law for transfer of ownership and other rights. Interoperable systems shall ensure, to the extent possible, that the rules of the systems are coordinated in this regard. ESMA and EBA, where applicable and both in close cooperation with the ESCB, may further specify, via draft regulatory technical standards, the following settlement finality moments: (i) the moment of entry of a transfer order into a system; (ii) the moment of irrevocability of a transfer order that into a system; and (iii) the moment of final settlement, for securities settlement systems not operated by a CSD, clearing and payment systems, including for DLT-based systems.  Article 22 provides that the moment of opening of insolvency proceedings shall be the moment when the relevant judicial or administrative authority handed down its decision. It furthermore specifies which authorities need to be notified.  Article 23 states that insolvency proceedings shall not have retroactive effects on the rights and obligations of a participant from its participation in a designated system or a system registered in a Member States where the participant is established.  Article 24 determines the law governing the rights and obligations of participants in the event of insolvency proceedings.  Article 25 determines that the rights of holders of collateral security shall be governed by the law of the Member State where the financial instrument is provided. Article 25(2) determines that the rights of the holders of a collateral security provided in connection with participation in a system should be determined by the law of the Member State in which the register, or the account where the collateral security is recorded, is located. Article 25(3) provides a derogation, where it is not possible to determine the location of a register. In such a case the rights with respect to the financial instrument provided as security, shall be governed by the law of the Member State governing the system. Article 25(4) defines what is meant by the reference to the law of a Member State.  Article 26 sets out the role of the central database, which facilitates the exchange of information and documents relevant to the recipients under this Regulation. The article also provides for access to the central database by competent authorities, registering authorities and national competent authorities.  Article 27 confers, for an indeterminate period, the power to adopt delegated acts under this Regulation on the Commission.  Article 28 sets out transitional measures, in particular clarifying that a transfer order which enters the system before the entry into force of this Regulation but is settled thereafter, shall be considered a transfer order under this Regulation.  Article 29 requires the Commission to draft a general report and requires ESMA, in close cooperation with the ESCB and the EBA, to submit a Report to the Commission on the functioning of the settlement finality regime, within 6 years of entry into force of this Regulation.  Article 30 repeals the SFD.  Article 31 amends certain provisions of the FCD, in particular by including in its scope cash, financial instruments and credit claims if they are issued or recorded on DLT. It also defines the terms and concepts necessary to interpret the provisions of the Regulation, i.e. ‘account’ and expands certain definitions to include digital recording, including DLT. Finally, it provides the transposition deadline for those amendments.  Article 32 determines the date of entry into force of the Regulation.  2025/0381 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  on settlement finality and repealing Directive 98/26/EC and amending Directive 2002/47/EC on financial collateral arrangements  (Text with EEA relevance)  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank 19  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 20 ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure 21 ,  Whereas:  (1) This proposal is part of a package designed to establish a single market for financial services by addressing market inefficiencies resulting from fragmentation and to create truly integrated European capital markets which are accessible to all citizens and businesses across the Union . The package seeks to unlock the U nion ’s financial markets potential by providing access to more efficient capital-market based financing and facilitating cross-border capital flows, which in turn sh ould support the U nion economy, stimulate job creation and enhance competitiveness.  (2) Directive 98/26/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 22 la ys down principles and rules aiming to reduce systemic risk arising from the insolvency of participants in payment systems and securities settlement systems by disapplying certain national insolvency rules, where a party to a transaction becomes insolvent, allowing payments and securities transactions to be made and settled safely. Directive 98/26/EC also protects collateral provided for by the insolvent party and clarifies which law is to apply in certain cross-border situations.  (3) A public consultation conducted in 2021 and the 2023 Commission report 23 showed that the obligations laid down in Directive 98/26/EC as well as protections granted towards domestic institutions participating in third-country systems were transposed differently by Member States, resulting in an unlevel playing field for Union systems and participants, and creating barriers to the smooth functioning of the single market.  (4) Divergent national approaches have resulted in the fragmentation of the single market. Systems and participants are subject to different rules in different Member States. In this respect, a system could be designated in one Member State and not in another , or a transfer order could be protected in one Member State and not in another, depending on the law of the Member State applicable to the system. The divergent national approaches cause legal uncertainty, prevent market integration and inhibit cross-border transactions .  (5) T o ensure that provisions imposing obligations on systems, their operators and their participants are applied in a uniform manner throughout the Union, thereby facilitat ing market integration and cross-border transactions , and ensur ing greater legal certainty, it is appropriate and necessary to repeal Directive 98/26/EC and replace it with a Regulation.  (6) T o enable a wider range of systems to benefit from the protections offered to systems and system operators , t he concepts used and the rules laid down should be neutral as regards the use of any particular technology, including distributed ledger technology (DLT). In particular, any references to register or recordings should include instances where such registers are established on DLT or otherwise on distributed ledgers and where recordings are made onto such ledgers-based registers and hence may or may not include wallets or other digital representations of ownership and rights.  (7) Regulation (EU) 2022/858 of the European Parliament and of the Council 24 allows for market infrastructures based on DLT to test and experiment with the provision of certain services via DLT, including by establishing systems that settle transfer orders in DLT-based financial instruments . It should be possible to designate such systems under this Regulation, subject to their compliance with the conditions set out in both Regulation (EU) 2022/858 and this Regulation. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the European B anking Authority ( EBA ) should be mandated to further specify the rules on how to assess and determine settlement finality in systems that use DLT .  (8) Since the national insolvency rules of the Member State whose law gover n s a system apply to that system, s ystems should be designated by the authorities of the Member State whose law governs the system, on the basis of uniform designation conditions and a harmonised procedure.  (9) Member States have adopted different approaches regarding the type of information to be publicly disclosed on Union systems and third-country systems to which they chose to extend the protections of Directive 98/26/EC. T o address the existing information asymmetry across Member States and to harmonise the information to be made publicly available, the type of information to be provided to the authorities in charge of the designation or registration of a system should be harmonised. Furthermore, ESMA should publish the information in a centralised way to facilitate access to that information. To ensure legal certainty , the information communicated to ESMA for the purpose of publication should be relevant, accurate and up-to-date.  (10) The list of entities that can be considered as participants in a system should take into account the different participation models adopted by systems, while ensuring that the aim to protect the financial system from systemic risk is met . To th at end, the entities to be admitted as participants should fulfil certain conditions to avoid creating unnecessary risks for the system in which they participate. S uch conditions should , however, not impose additional requirements where the system operator already applies admission requirements to the system under Union law when admitting new entities as participants to its designated systems, as in the case of central counterparties ( CCPs ) and central security deposit orie s ( CSDs ) . It should be possible to include as participants in a system entities that perform validation or consensus functions that are essential for maintaining settlement integrity.  (11) T o ensure an effective application of the settlement finality protection s , Member States should nominate the authority or authorities responsible for the designation, the registration and the communication of the opening of insolvency proceedings . Those authorities should be granted the necessary powers for the exercise of their functions. They should cooperate and exchange information as necessary with each other and with ESMA and the members of the European System of Central Banks ( ESCB ) . To facilitate their tasks and increase transparency across the Union, the list of those authorities should be made public.  (12) Member States should be able to apply the protections provided to Union systems to entities established on their territory that participate directly in third-country systems and to collateral security provided in connection with participation in such third-country systems. In order to remedy the unlevel playing field regarding participation of Union entities in third-country system s stemming from the different national regimes developed by Member States to extend the protections of Directive 98/96/EC, a harmonised regime for registration by Member States of third-country systems should be laid down . It should be based on a formalised and harmonised procedure that ensures the application of clear standards and that streamlines access conditions for all Union entities participating in a given third-country system. Registration of third-country systems by Member States should be done by the Member State in which an entity participating in such system is established. Th at may , however, result in several Member States registering the same third-country arrangement if members are established in several Member States. To prevent any unlevel-playing field for entities established in different Member States, the registration of such systems should be done in a coordinated and convergent way and be facilitated by ESMA , EBA and the ESCB.  (13) The reduction of systemic risk requires, in particular, the finality of settlement and the enforceability of collateral security. Transfer orders and their netting should therefore be legally enforceable in all Member States and binding on third parties. Rules on enforceability of netting should not prevent systems from testing, before the netting takes place, whether orders that have entered the system comply with the rules of that system and allow the settlement of that system to take place.  (14) Settlement should be considered final when the parties to the contract underlying the settlement have fully discharge d their obligations towards the other party in an unconditional and irrevocable manner. The moment a transfer order enters a system and the moment of irrevocability of a transfer order are important moments for the application of insolvency law to that transfer order. T o ensure the highest possible degree of consistency regarding settlement finality protection across systems, as well as to facilitate cross-border activity in the single market, it is necessary to lay down principles to be used for the determination of those moments for all types of systems. At the same time, those principles should allow for the possibility to develop regulatory technical standards to tailor those principles to the specific characteristics of each system while taking into account the existence of different types of systems, the different technologies used and the mechanics of each system. Systems should include, where they exist, those specific and tailored moments of settlement finality in their rules in a clear manner.  (15) P articipant s or third part ies should not be prevented from exercising any right or claim resulting from the underlying transaction which they may have in law to recovery or restitution in respect of a transfer order which has entered a system, including in case of fraud or technical error, as long as th at leads neither to the unwinding of netting nor to the revocation of the transfer order in the system.  (16) Member States should immediately notify each other of the opening of insolvency proceedings against a participant in the system. Insolvency proceedings should not have a retroactive effect on the rights and obligations of participants in a system.  (17) In the event of insolvency proceedings against a participant in a system, it should be clear which insolvency law is applicable to the rights and obligations of that participant in connection with its participation in a system.  (18) Collateral security should be insulated from the effects of the insolvency law applicable to the insolvent participant. Collateral security comprises all means provided by a participant to the other participants in the settlement system, to secure rights and obligations in connection with that system, including repurchase agreements, statutory liens and fiduciary transfers.  (19) In the case of linked systems, it is necessary to ensure adequate protection of the system operator that provides collateral security to a receiving system operator in the event of insolvency proceedings against that receiving system operator.  (20) It is necessary to provide a conflict of laws rule regarding the rights of holders of collateral security in order to ensure that the law of the Member State where the collateral security was validly created in a register, account or centralised deposit system, determines also the validity and enforceability of that collateral security against the system, the system operator, and against any other person claiming directly or indirectly through it. That rule should only apply to a register, account or centralised deposit system which evidences the existence of proprietary rights in or for the delivery or transfer of the collateral security concerned.  (21) It is necessary to clarify the law of which Member State should apply to determine the rights of the holders of that collateral security. However, in some circumstances, in particular regarding the use of new technologies, it is not always possible to determine in which Member State the register, account or centralised deposit system, where the collateral security is legally recorded, is located. In such cases, the rights of the holders of that collateral security should be determined by the law governing the system concerned in connection with that collateral security.  (22) It is also necessary to provide a conflict of laws rule regarding the law applicable in case of insolvency of a participant. Th at rule should not prejudice the operation and effect of the law of the Member State under which the financial instruments are constituted or of the law of the Member State where the financial instruments may otherwise be located, including, inter alia, the law concerning the creation, ownership or transfer of such financial instruments or of rights in such financial instruments, and should not be interpreted to mean that any such collateral security will be directly enforceable or be capable of being recognised in any such Member State otherwise than in accordance with the law of that Member State.  (23) In view of the changes made in this Regulation, it is necessary to amend Directive 2002/47/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 25 to ensure consistency. Divergences in the scope of this Regulation and Directive 2002/47/EC would cause legal uncertainty and conflicting application, in particular in relation to instruments issued on DLT, as such instruments would be recognised as potential collateral under this Regulation but not necessarily under Directive 2002/47/EC.  (24) ESMA , EBA and the ESCB should play a central role in the application of this Regulation by ensuring consistent application of Union rules by national competent authorities.  (25) The Commission should be empowered to adopt regulatory technical standards developed by ESMA and EBA with regard to further specifying the following: the information to be provided in an application for designation; the conditions for designation; the information to be provided in an application for registration; the moment of entry of a transfer order into a system not operated by a CSD , including DLT-based systems ; the moment of irrevocability of a transfer order entered into a system not operated by a CSD , including DLT-based systems ; and the moment of final settlement in systems not operated by a CSD , including DLT-based systems . The Commission should adopt those regulatory technical standards by means of delegated acts pursuant to Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council 26 and with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Counci l 27  (26) T he Commission should also be empowered to adopt implementing technical standards developed by ESMA or EBA with regard to the electronic format s for the application for designation , and the electronic formats for the application for the registration of a third-country system. The Commission should adopt those implementing technical standards by means of implementing acts pursuant to Article 291 TFEU and in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 and with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council .  (27) The power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) should be delegated to the Commission in respect of amendments to the definition of transfer order to add or remove settlement assets and amendments to the list of participants. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.  (28) Systems which were designated under Directive 98/26/EC, and third-country systems to which Member States extended the protections of that Directive prior to the date of entry into force of this Regulation, should benefit from some transitional measures in order to provide sufficient time for Member States to designate or register those systems, as applicable, in accordance with the conditions set out in this Regulation. The application of the designation and registration requirements for those systems should therefore be deferred.  (29) Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely to ensure a harmonised approach to p rotection against systemic risk arising from the functioning of settlement systems, in connection with the insolvency of any of their participants, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives ,  (30) This Regulation introduces binding requirements for cross-border digital public services within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2024/903 28 . The Digital Dimensions chapter of the Legislative Financial and Digital Statement constitutes the resulting report. This will also be published on the Interoperable Europe Portal following the Act's adoption .  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  TITLE I  OBJECT, SCOPE AND DEFINITIONS  Article 1  Object and scope  1.

TITLE II  SYSTEM DESIGNATION  Article 3  Designated system  1. Where an undertaking operates or intends to operate a system governed by the law of a Member State , such a system operator may apply for that system to be designated in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 4, as a system in the Union to which the settlement finality rules laid down in Articles 1 7 to 2 5 apply.  A system operator referred to in paragraph 1 that, to a limited extent, offers the settlement, clearing or execution of instructions related to instruments other than those referred to in Article 2(1), point (20)(b), may request that the settlement finality rules set out in Articles 17 to 25 also apply in relation to such instruments. The designating authority may allow such instructions to be considered transfer orders when it considers that such a designation is warranted on grounds of systemic risk.  2. The designating authority of the Member State whose law governs the system may designate the system, where at least one of its participants has its head office in that Member State.  Article 4  Procedure for granting and refusing designation  1. A system operator that applies for designation of a system that it operates shall submit an application for designation addressed to the designating authority of the Member State whose law governs the system.  2. The application shall be immediately shared with all of the following:  (a) the designating authority;  (b) where applicable, the national competent authority;  (c) ESMA;  (d) EBA for systems operating transfer orders set out in Article 2(1) , point (20)(a);  (e) The ESCB.  3. The system operator shall include in the application all documents and information necessary to demonstrate that it and the system it operates meet the requirements in this Regulation , including the information listed in Article 6(2) ( a ) and ( c ) to ( g ).  4. An acknowledgement of receipt of the application referred to in paragraph 1 shall be sent to the system operator within two working days of receipt of such application. The designating authority shall, within 20 working days of receipt of the application, determine whether the application contains the documents and information required pursuant to paragraph 3.  Where, during the applicable period specified under the first subparagraph, the designating authority concludes that not all documents and information required pursuant to paragraph 3 have been submitted, it shall request the system operator to submit such additional documents or information. Where the system operator has failed to comply with any such request in full, the designating authority may reject the application.  5. By the end of the time limits referred to in paragraph 4, t he designating authority shall notify the system operator and the authorities listed in paragraph 2, points (b) to (e), as applicable, whether the application is accepted or rejected.  6. After having notified the system operator that the application is accepted, the designating authority shall conduct an assessment of the system operator’s and the system’s compliance with the requirements laid down in this Regulation within 80 working days of the date of the notification referred to in paragraph 5 (‘the assessment period’).  7. During the assessment period, the designating authority may submit questions to, or request complementary information from, the system operator.  Where the system operator has not responded to the questions or provided the requested information within the deadline set by the designating authority, the designating authority may decide to extend once the relevant assessment period by a maximum of 10 working days in total where, in its view, any of the questions or information is material for the assessment. The designating authority shall inform the system operator of the extension provided. The designating authority may take a decision on the application in the absence of the system operator’s response.  8. Within the assessment period , the designating authority shall decide whether to grant or refuse the designation of the system referred to in Article 3. The designating authority shall decide to grant designation only where it is fully satisfied that the system and its operator comply with the requirements laid down in this Regulation.  9. After taking a decision referred to in paragraph 8 , the designating authority shall, inform, without undue delay, the system operator, and the authorities listed in paragraph 2, points (b) to (e), as applicable, of its decision, including a fully reasoned explanation.  Article 5  Conditions for designation  1. A designating authority shall designate a system in accordance with Article 3, only where the designating authority is satisfied that all of the following conditions are fulfilled:  (a) the system is governed by the law of the Member State of the designating authority;  (b) at least one of the participants to the system is established in the Member State of the designating authority;  (c) the system has common rules and standardised procedures for the settlement, clearing, or execution, as applicable, of transfer orders between the participants;  (d) the system has clearly identified in its common rules and standardised procedures the moments of finality that fulfil the requirements set out in Articles 1 8 , 20 and 2 1 .  (e) t he common rules and standardised procedures of the system stipulate, where relevant in accordance with Article 7, the requirements for participation in the system;  (f) there are no apparent conflicts between the common rules and standardised procedures of the system and the law governing the system;  (g) the system operator is able to ensure adequate monitoring of compliance of its system with the common rules and standardised procedures of the system it operates;  (h) the system operator is capable of operating the system, is of sufficiently good repute and has sufficient experience to ensure the sound and prudent management of the system;  (i) the system operator has enough financial resources to operate the system;  (j) the system operator is legally accountable, responsible and liable for the operation of the system, including for any links to other systems and the relationship to third parties and to the authorities;  (k) the system operator has put in place sufficient measures to mitigate the risks related to the operation of the system;  (l) where the system operator consists of a network of nodes operating under a common governance and supervision framework, the common rules and standardised procedures of the system shall ensure that one undertaking is legally accountable, responsible and liable for the operation of the system ;  (m) where the system operator is a consortium of entities, all entities shall be jointly and severally accountable, responsible and liable for the operation of the system.  2. ESMA may, in close cooperation with the ESCB, develop draft regulatory technical standards to further specify the conditions referred to in paragraph 1 for securities settlement systems and clearing systems.  The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council 38 .  3. EBA may, in close cooperation with the ESCB, develop draft regulatory technical standards to further specify the conditions referred to in paragraph 1 for payment systems.  The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 109 3 /2010 39 .  Article 6  Notification of a designated system  4. A designating authority shall notify , simultaneously and without undue delay, ESMA and the system operator of its decision taken pursuant to Article 4 . The designation shall be effective from the date of notification .  5. The notification referred to in paragraph 1 shall contain at least all of the following information, as of the date of the designation:  (a) the identification of the system, the law governing the system, the system operator and the designating authority;  (b) the date on which the system was designated;  (c) the Member State in which the system operator is established and the national competent authority , where applicable ;  (d) whether the system is a securities settlement system, a clearing system or a payment system;  (e) the finality moments of the system as specified in its rules in accordance with Articles 1 8 , 20 and 21 ;  (f) the participants to the system;  (g) t he common rules and standardised procedures of the system;  (h) the designating authority’s assessment of the system operator’s and system’s compliance with the requirements under this Regulation, including the conditions for designation set out in Article 5.  6. The designating authority shall notify ESMA and the authorities listed in Article 4(2), points (b) , ( d) and (e ), as applicable, without undue delay, of any of the following:  (a) any notifications made by the system operator in accordance with Article 8(2);  (b) any changes to the designation of the system;  (c) any updates to the information listed in paragraph 2.  7. ESMA shall publish in a standardised format the information referred to in paragraph 2 , point (a) to (g) , and any updates thereto in accordance with paragraph 3, point (c ), on its website without undue delay and no later than 2 working days after receipt of that information. ESMA shall specify the date when updates to the information on its website were made and which information was updated .  ESMA shall, without undue delay, provide updated information to EBA and the ESCB, as applicable.  Article 7  Participants in designated systems  1. A system operator may admit one or more types of participants listed in Article 2(1), point (15)(a)(i) to (vii), to the designated system it operates .  A designated system that allows a participant to act in several of the capacities listed in Article 2(1), point (15)(a), or carry out part or all the tasks related to those capacities, shall specify that in its common rules and standardised procedures.  A Member State may, in exceptional circumstances and for the purposes of this Regulation, admit an indirect participant as participant where the indirect participant is known to the system operator and the participants of the system, and where that is warranted on the grounds of systemic risk. That possibility shall, however, not limit the responsibility of the participant through which the indirect participant passes transfer orders to the designated system.  2. A system operator of a designated system may accept a system member to the system only where that member meets all of the following conditions:  (a) it has the capacity and ability to meet the obligations arising from its participation in the system;  (b) it has the capacity and ability to mitigate the risks resulting from its participation in the system;  (c) it complies with the rules of the system.  A system operator of a designated system shall establish admission criteria, differentiating per type of participant where relevant. Such admission criteria shall be non-discriminatory, transparent and objective to ensure fair and open access to the designated system.  A system operator of a designated system shall ensure that the system members comply with the conditions set out in the first subparagraph on an ongoing basis and shall have timely access to the information relevant for such assessment.  3. A participant that enables its clients to access a designated system by transmitting instructions for transfer orders through that system shall inform the system operator of that system thereof . That participant shall have the necessary additional financial resources and operational capacity to perform that activity and shall provide the system operator with the information necessary to identify, monitor and manage relevant concentrations of risk relating to the provision of services to clients.  A participant that enables its clients to access the services of the system shall, upon request from the system operator, inform the system operator about the criteria and arrangements it adopts to enable its clients to access those services. Regardless of such information, that participant shall remain solely responsible with respect to the system operator and other participants to the system for ensuring that its clients comply with their obligations.  Article 8  Duties of a system operator of a designated system  1. The system operator of a designated system shall be responsible for its compliance, and that of the system it operates with the provisions of this Regulation at all times.  2. The system operator shall notify , without undue delay, to the designating authority of any of the following:  (a) any material changes that affect or may affect the system operator’s compliance, and that of the system it operates, with the provisions of this Regulation;  (b) any changes to the list of information provided for in Article 6(2), points (a) to ( g ).  Article 9  Withdrawal of designation  1. A designating authority shall withdraw a designation it granted, where any of the following conditions is met :  (a) the system operator has obtained the designation by making false statements or by any other irregular or unlawful means;  (b) the system operator or the system it operat es , as applicable, no longer compl ies with the requirements of this Regulation and the system operator has not taken the remedial actions requested by the designating authority within a set timeframe;  (c) the system operator or the system it operat es , as applicable, ha s seriously or systemically infringed the requirements laid down in this Regulation.  2. A designating authority shall only decide to withdraw the designation of a system after it has informed the national competent authority and requested an opinion on the appropriateness of withdrawing the designation . The opinion shall be requested from ESMA and the ESCB for the withdrawal of the designation for securities settlement systems and clearing systems, or from EBA and the ESCB, for the withdrawal of the designation for payment systems.  Where ESMA, EBA or the ESCB are of the opinion that the withdrawal of the designation may cause material risks to the financial stability of the Union or in a Member State, it shall inform the designating authority within 10 working days of being informed of a potential withdrawal of a designation under first subparagraph and the designating authority shall, before withdrawing the designation of the system, convene an ad hoc meeting with the national competent authority, the ESCB and, depending on the nature of the system, ESMA or EBA, to cooperate on how to mitigate the risks identified.  Where the designated system is a CSD or a CCP, the designating authority shall not withdraw the designation without the consent of the authority responsible for the supervision of that CSD or CCP.  3.

The third-country system operator shall include in the application all documents and information necessary to demonstrate that it and the system it operates meet the conditions for registration laid down in Article 14 , including the information on the members of that system which are established in the Union, broken down by Member State.  4. An acknowledgement of receipt of the application referred to in paragraph 1 shall be sent to the third-country system operator within two working days of receipt of such application . The registering authorities shall, within 20 working days from receipt of the application, determine whether the application contains the documents and information required pursuant to paragraph 3 .  Where, during the applicable period specified under the first subparagraph, any of the registering authorities concludes that not all documents or information required pursuant to paragraph 3 have been submitted, such authority shall request the third-country system operator to submit such additional documents or information. Where the third-country system operator has failed to comply with any such request in full, any of the registering authorities may reject the application.  5. By the end of the time limits referred to in paragraph 4 , each registering authorit y shall notify ESMA , the third-country system operator and the authorities listed in paragraph 2, points ( a ) , (b) and ( c ) , whether the application is accepted or rejected .  6. After having notified the third-country system operator that the application is accepted, each registering authority that accepted the application shall conduct an assessment of the third-country system operator ’s and the system’s compliance with the conditions for registration laid down in Article 14 within 80 working days of the notification set out in paragraph 5 (‘the assessment period’) .  7. During the assessment period, any registering authority may submit questions to, or request complementary information from, the third-country system operator .  Where the third-country system operator has not responded to the questions or provided the requested information within the deadline set by a requesting registering authority, ESMA may, upon request by any of the registering authorities that accepted the application, extend once the relevant assessment period by a maximum of 10 working days in total where, in their view, any of the questions is material for the assessment. ESMA shall inform the third-country system operator of the extension provided. A registering authority may take a decision on the application in the absence of the third-country system operator’s response.  8. During the assessment period, ESMA and the ESCB for securities settlement systems and clearing systems, and EBA and the ESCB for payments systems, shall take all appropriate measures, including convening ad hoc meetings, to ensure a convergent approach to the decisions to grant or refuse the registration of a third-country system by the registering authorities in their respective Member State.  9. During the assessment process, ESMA , EBA and the ESCB shall promote the regular exchange and discussion among regist ering authorities, to ensure cooperation of the registering authorities in the registration process of such third-country system and provide input to the registering authorities’ assessment process.  10. Within the assessment period, each registering authority shall decide whether to grant or refuse the registration of the third - country system. Each registering authority shall decide to grant the registration only where it is fully satisfied that the third - country system operator and the third - country system comply with the conditions laid down in Article 14 .  11. After taking a decision referred to in paragraph 1 0 , each registering authority shall inform, without undue delay, the third-country system operator, ESMA and the authorities listed in paragraph 2 , points (a) , (b) and (c) a s applicable, of its decision, including a fully reasoned explanation .  12.

TITLE IV  NETTNG AND SETTLEMENT FINALITY  Article 17  Netting and transfer orders  1. Transfer orders and netting, including close-out netting , shall be legally enforceable and binding on third parties, provided that transfer orders were entered into the designated system or registered system before the moment of opening of insolvency proceedings as referred to in Article 2 2 (1), even in the event of insolvency proceedings against any of the following:  (a) a participant in the designated system or registered system;  (b) a participant to an interoperable system to a designated system;  (c) the system operator of an interoperable system to a designated system, which is not a participant.  Transfer orders that are entered into a designated system or registered system after the moment of opening of insolvency proceedings and that are carried out within the business day, as laid down in the common rules and standardised procedures of such system, during which the opening of such proceedings occur, shall be legally enforceable and binding on third parties only where the system operator can prove that, at the time that such transfer orders become irrevocable, it was neither aware, nor should have been aware, of the opening of such proceedings.  2. No law, regulation, rule or practice on the setting aside of contracts and transactions concluded before the moment of opening of insolvency proceedings, as provided for in Article 2 2 (1), shall lead to the unwinding of netting, or the disapplication of close-out netting provision s as referred to in Article 2(1), point (n), of Directive 2002/47/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council .  Article 18  Moment of entry of a transfer order into a designated system  1. The moment of entry of a transfer order into a designated system shall be determined by the common rules and standardised procedures of that system . Such determination shall take account of the receipt and registration of the transfer order by the system .  2. In the case of interoperable systems, each designated system shall determine in its own common rules and standardised procedures the moment of entry of a transfer order into its system, while ensuring, to the extent possible, that the common rules and standardised procedures of all interoperable systems concerned are coordinated. Unless expressly provided for by the common rules and standardised procedures of all the systems that are party to the interoperab ility arrangement , one system's rules on the moment of entry of a transfer order shall not be affected by any rules of the other systems with which it is interoperable.  Article 19  Use of funds and financial instruments  1. The opening of insolvency proceedings against a participant or a system operator of an interoperable system shall not prevent funds or financial instruments available on the settlement account or on accounts holding collateral, including default fund contributions such as contributions to a pre-funded default fund held by a CCP in accordance with Article 42 of Regulation No 648/2012 and margins as r eferred to in Art icle 41 of Regulation No 648/2012 , where applicable, of that participant or system operator from being used to fulfil that participant’s obligations in the designated system, or registered system in the Member State where the participant is established, or in an interoperab ility arrangement on the business day of the opening of the insolvency proceedings.  2. Such a participant’s credit facility connected to the designated system or registered system, as applicable, shall be usable against available, existing collateral security to fulfil that participant’s obligations in the designated system, or in the registered system in the Member State where the participant is established, or in an interoperab ility arrangement .  Article 20  The moment of irrevocability of transfer orders  1. Each designated system shall determine the specific moment where, in its system, a participant or a third party cannot revoke a transfer order. Such determination shall take account of the moment when a transfer order that entered into the system was confirmed by the system and where the processing of the order could not be reversed.  2. In the case of interoperable systems, each system shall determine in its own common rules and standardised procedures the moment of irrevocability, while ensuring, to the extent possible, that the common rules and standardised procedures of all interoperable systems concerned are coordinated. Unless expressly provided for by the common rules and standardised procedures of all the systems that are party to an interoperability arrangement, one system's rules on the moment of irrevocability shall not be affected by any rules of the other systems with which it is interoperable.  Article 21  Final settlement  1. Settlement shall be final when the discharge of the obligations of the parties to a transaction is completed in an unconditional and irrevocable manner as determined by the common rules and standardised procedures of each designated system, in accordance with the applicable law for transfer of ownership and other rights. A designated system that is based on DLT shall implement mechanisms guaranteeing deterministic and legally enforceable finality moments.  2. In the case of interoperable systems, each system shall determine in its own common rules and standardised procedures the moment of final settlement. Each system operator shall ensure, to the extent possible, that the rules of all interoperable systems concerned are coordinated. Unless expressly provided for by the common rules and standardised procedures of all the systems that are party to an interoperability arrangement, one system's common rules and standardised procedures on the moment of final settlement shall not be affected by any common rules or standardised procedures of the other systems with which it is interoperable.  3. ESMA may, in close cooperation with the ESCB, for clearing and securities settlement systems not operated by a CSD, and taking into account the specificities of different types of systems , and the mechanics of th os e system s , develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the rules for determining all of the following:  (a) the moment of entry of transfer orders into a designated system, referred to in Article 18(1);  (b) for DLT-based designated systems, when and how the moment of entry of a transfer order into the system , referred to in Article 18(1), occurs when a transaction is recorded in the ledger according to the system’s consensus rules;  (c) the moment , referred to in Article 20(1) , in which a transfer order that entered into the designated system cannot be rev oked ;  (d) for DLT-based designated systems, how the moment , referred to in Article 20(1) , in which a transfer order that entered into the system cannot be revoked by a participant or by a third party coincides with the point at which consensus is final and the record cannot be reversed under the technical protocol of that system;  (e) the moment of final settlement referred to in paragraph 1 ;  (f) for DLT-based designated systems, how the moment of final settlement referred to in paragraph 1 could be defined for probabilistic or layered finality models, which may not meet the absolute legal certainty but may still be able to achieve legal certainty depending on the structure and rules of the system.  The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.  4. EBA may, in close cooperation with the ESCB, and taking into account the specificities of different types of payments systems and the mechanics of the system s , develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the rules for determining all of the following:  (a) the moment of entry of transfer orders into a designated system referred to in Article 18(1);  (b) for DLT-based designated systems, when and how the moment of entry of a transfer order into the system , referred to in Article 18(1), occurs when a transaction is recorded in the ledger according to the system’s consensus rules;  (c) the moment , referred to in Article 20(1), in which a transfer order that entered into the designated system cannot be revoked;  (d) for DLT-based designated systems, when and how the specific moment in which a transfer order that entered int o the system cannot be revoked by a participant or by a third party coincides with the point at which consensus is final and the record cannot be reversed under the technical protocol of that system;  (e) the moment of final settlement referred to in paragraph 1 ;  (f) for DLT-based designated systems,  how the moment of final settlement , referred to in paragraph 1, could be defined for probabilistic or layered finality models, which may not meet the absolute legal certainty but may still be able to achieve legal certainty depending on the structure and rules of the system.  The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.  TITLE V  PROVISIONS CONCERNING INSOLVENCY PROCEEDINGS  Article 22  The moment of opening of insolvency proceedings  1.

Such proceedings shall not have retroactive effect on the rights and obligations of a participant in an interoperable system, or on a system operator of an interoperable system where such system operator is not a participant.  Article 24  Law governing the rights and obligations of participants  In the event of insolvency proceedings being opened against a participant in a system, the rights and obligations arising from, or in connection with, the participation of that participant shall be determined by the law governing that system.  TITLE VI  INSULATION OF THE RIGHTS OF HOLDERS OF COLLATERAL SECURITY FROM THE EFFECTS OF THE INSOLVENCY OF THE PROVIDER  Article 25  Collateral security  1. The rights of a system operator or of a participant to collateral security provided to them in connection with a designated system, a registered system for its participants established in the Member States where the system is registered, or an interoperab ility arrangement , and the rights of central banks of the Member States or the European Central Bank to collateral security provided to them, shall not be affected by insolvency proceedings against any of the following:  (a) the participant in the designated or the registered system concerned or in an interoperab ility arrangement ;  (b) the system operator of an interoperable system which is not a participant;  (c) a counterparty to the central bank of a Member State;  (d) a counterparty to the European Central Bank;  (e) any third party which provided the collateral security.  Such collateral security may be realised for the satisfaction of those rights.  The rights of a system operator to the collateral security it provided to another system operator in connection with an interoperability arrangement shall not be affected by insolvency proceedings against the receiving system operator.  2. The rights of participants, system operators, a central bank of a Member State, the European Central Bank and of any nominee, agent or third party acting on their behalf with respect to the financial instruments, including rights in those financial instruments, which are provided as collateral security that is legally recorded on a register, including where recorded on a distri buted ledger, account or centralised deposit system located in a Member State, shall be governed by the law of that Member State.

FRAMEWORK OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE  1.1. Title of the proposal/initiative  Proposal for a Regulation (EU) 2025/XXX of the European Parliament and of the Council on settlement finality and repealing Directive 98/26/EC and amending Directive 2002/47/EC on financial collateral arrangements  1.2. Policy area(s) concerned  Internal market – financial services  1.3. Objective(s)  1.3.1. General objective(s)  The initiative is part of the Savings and Investment Union which aims to foster a seamless, integrated capital market across the EU by strengthening the supervisory framework, addressing regulatory fragmentation and ensuring better integration and deepening of capital markets throughout the Union to realise the Savings and Investments Union’s full potential. The objective is to remove barriers to cross-border activity.  1.3.2. Specific objective(s)  Specific objective No 1 – harmonising the provisions on settlement finality  In order to achieve harmonisation of the provisions on settlement finality as well as reduce legal uncertainty related to diverging transposition in Member States, the current Settlement Finality Directive is turned into a Regulation.  Specific objective No 2 - modernising the provisions on settlement finality to recognise new technologies and financial developments  The proposed amendments aim at ensuring to maintain the technological neutrality of the settlement finality legislation by clarifying where needed to cater for the use of new technologies and financial developments.  1.3.3. Expected result(s) and impact  Specify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.  Enhanced harmonisation  Enhanced legal certainty, amongst others regarding the use of new technologies  Reduced cross-border market barriers  1.3.4. Indicators of performance  Specify the indicators for monitoring progress and achievements.  Core set indicator – specific objective No 1  Enhanced cross-border participation in SFR designated systems, measured by number of EU participants in a system that is not governed by the law of a Member State where the participant is headquartered. To be compared: The number of EU participants headquartered in another Member State than which law is governing the system at the time of entry into force of the SFR with 5 years after the mandatory SFR designation enters into force.  Core set indicator – specifc objective No 2  The number of SFR designated systems using new technologies (such as DLT) 5 years after the mandatory SFR designation enters into force.  1.4. The proposal/initiative relates to:   a new action   a new action following a pilot project / preparatory action 40   the extension of an existing action   a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action  1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative  1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative  All systems that are required or wish to be designated under settlement finality legislation in the EU, need to comply with the harmonised requirements set out under the Settlement Finality Regulation. EU national competent authorities as well as the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the European Banking Authority (EBA) and European System of Central Banks (ESCB) are required to implement and provide guidance on the examination of different areas related to the designation process of systems.  1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, greater effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this section 'added value of EU involvement' is the value resulting from EU action, that is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.  Reasons for action at EU level (ex-ante) There’s a compelling EU dimension as national solutions cannot adequately address the cross-border and fragmented nature and the regulatory divergences of EU capital markets. The EU needs the scale to compete globally and finance our needs and such scale can only be achieved at EU level. EU-level actions are best positioned to remove cross-border regulatory barriers, ensuring a level playing field across the EU, catalysing market integration, enhancing market scale, efficiency and competitiveness and providing a unified regulatory framework that national actions cannot achieve individually. The initiative will be based on Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. This provision is the legal base of the legal acts to be amended by this proposal.  Expected generated EU added value (ex-post) Enhanced harmonisation across the EU and thus reduced market fragmentation as well as reduced cross-border market barriers. Greater legal certainty, amongst others regarding the use of new technologies.  1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past  The use of a Directive as an instrument to provide settlement finality in the past has shown that diverging implementation in Member States led to a fragmented market creating cross-border barriers. Therefore, turning the Settlement Finality Directive into a Regulation seems to be the right instrument to ensure greater harmonisation and reduce as a consequence cross-border barriers.  1.5.4. Compatibility with the multiannual financial framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments  The proposal is compatible with the Commission proposal of 16 July 2025 for a multiannual financial framework for years 2028-34, specifically as regards the budget of individual agencies. Therefore, figures are indicative pending the final adoption of the MFF.  1.5.5. Assessment of the different available financing options, including scope for redeployment  Additional resources are necessary for agencies to work on the SFR mandates and assist ensuring consistent application of SFR requirements across Member States. In order to ensure greater consistency regarding the designation of EU systems as well as registration of third-country systems, ESMA and EBA are in particular supposed to assist Member States in their assessments of i) systems applying for SFR designation and ii) third-country systems applying for registration, to ensure a convergent approach. These are recurring tasks which require an expertise in the area of insolvency law as well as regarding financial market infrastructures.  The fee option is practically unworkable as fees could not be levied on system operators as the designation work is done by Member States while ESMA’s and EBA’s roles are to ensure convergence and provide guidance where needed. In addition, such an approach would also be difficult to justify, as the considered measures are not directly linked to supervisory powers, but part of developing the regulatory framework.  The scope for redeployment was assessed. The additional resources envisaged would cover only partially the need of ESMA and EBA during the initial phase for the work required under the SFR to develop a series of Delegated Acts, as well as for ESMA to establish and run the central database as required under Article 26 of the SFR. Since this central database is established under an earlier mandate, i.e. Regulation (EU) 2024/2987 (‘EMIR 3’), the costs associated with the set-up and ongoing maintenance of the central database under the SFR only reflect the relative increase in those costs in order for the central database to be implemented as required under the SFR. These costs are incorporated into the figures provided in the Master Regulation document related to the “ESMA Central Database and supervisory platform for CCPs, CSDs and TVs” (see Section 4.3 of the Master Regulation, as well as Parts D and E of the section on Specific Assumptions in the Annex of that Regulation) and are thus not presented separately here. Once these have been implemented, the resulting new recurring tasks at both ESMA and EBA will require one FTE in each agency, in particular to cover the work on assisting Member States regarding new designations and re-designations as well as registrations.  1.6. Duration of the proposal/initiative and of its financial impact   limited duration  –  in effect from [DD/MM]YYYY to [DD/MM]YYYY  –  financial impact from YYYY to YYYY for commitment appropriations and from YYYY to YYYY for payment appropriations.   unlimited duration  – Implementation with a start-up period in 2028  – followed by full-scale operation.  1.7. Method(s) of budget implementation planned 41   Direct management by the Commission  –  by its departments, including by its staff in the Union delegations;  –  by the executive agencies   Shared management with the Member States   Indirect management by entrusting budget implementation tasks to:  –  third countries or the bodies they have designated  –  international organisations and their agencies (to be specified)  –  the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund  –  bodies referred to in Articles 70 and 71 of the Financial Regulation  –  public law bodies  –  bodies governed by private law with a public service mission to the extent that they are provided with adequate financial guarantees  –  bodies governed by the private law of a Member State that are entrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership and that are provided with adequate financial guarantees  –  bodies or persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in the common foreign and security policy pursuant to Title V of the Treaty on European Union, and identified in the relevant basic act  –   bodies established in a Member State, governed by the private law of a Member State or Union law and eligible to be entrusted, in accordance with sector-specific rules, with the implementation of Union funds or budgetary guarantees, to the extent that such bodies are controlled by public law bodies or by bodies governed by private law with a public service mission, and are provided with adequate financial guarantees in the form of joint and several liability by the controlling bodies or equivalent financial guarantees and which may be, for each action, limited to the maximum amount of the Union support.  Comments  2. MANAGEMENT MEASURES  2.1. Monitoring and reporting rules  As decentralised agencies, the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) fully comply with the legal and operational requirements of the Union laws in terms of monitoring and reporting rules.  In line with already existing arrangements, the ESAs prepare regular reports on their activity (including internal reporting to Senior Management, reporting to Boards and the production of the annual report), and are subject to audits by the Court of Auditors and the Commission's Internal Audit Service on their use of resources and performance.  Monitoring and reporting of the actions included in the proposal will be covered and comply with the already existing requirements, as well as with any new requirements resulting from this proposal.  2.2. Management and control system(s)  2.2.1. Justification of the budget implementation method(s), the funding implementation mechanism(s), the payment modalities and the control strategy proposed  The European Supervisory Agencies for financial services (EBA, EIOPA, ESMA), are decentralised regulatory agencies pursuant to Art. 70 Financial Regulation.  Management and control systems of ESMA and EBA are provided for in Chapter VI of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 and No 1093/2010 establishing them, in combination with the applicable framework financial Regulation (EU) 2019/715 as endorsed by each Authority.  In accordance with Article 30 of their respective Financial Regulations, the Authorities must ensure that the appropriate standards are met in all areas of the internal control framework which should be based upon best international practices and on the Internal Control Framework laid down by the Commission for its own departments.  In accordance with Article 70.5 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 of the European Parliament and of the Council (the Financial Regulation), the Internal Auditor of the Commission is also the Internal Auditor of ESMA and EBA. In particular, in accordance with Article 78.3 of the Financial Regulations of both agencies, the Commission’s Internal Auditor (i.e. the Internal Audit Service) is responsible for:  (a) assessing the suitability and effectiveness of internal management systems and the performance of departments in implementing programmes and actions by reference to the risks associated with them;  (b) assessing the efficiency and effectiveness of the internal control and audit systems applicable to each operation for implementation of the budget of the Union body.  These responsibilities of the Internal Audit Service will also extend to the new tasks to be implemented by ESMA and EBA as laid down by the proposed legislation.  As well as the work of the Internal Audit Service, ESMA and EBA are both subject to external audit including by the European Court of Auditors, which in accordance with Article 104 of the Financial Regulations of ESMA, shall each year prepare specific annual reports on ESMA in line with the requirements of Article 287(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  2.2.2. Information concerning the risks identified and the internal control system(s) set up to mitigate them  In relation to the legal, economic, efficient and effective use of appropriations resulting from the actions to be carried out in the context of this proposal by ESMA and EBA, this initiative does not bring about new significant risks that would not be covered by an existing internal control framework.  2.2.3. Estimation and justification of the cost-effectiveness of the controls (ratio between the control costs and the value of the related funds managed), and assessment of the expected levels of risk of error (at payment & at closure)  Management and control systems are provided in Regulation (EU) 1095/2010 and and 1093/2010 which govern the functioning of respectively ESMA and EBA. These are deemed to be cost effective. The initiative will have no significant effect on costs to be supported by the Member States, ESMA or the EBA from that angle. Impacts on risks of error rates are expected to be very low.  Historically DG FISMA’s costs of the overall supervision of an Authority such as ESMA or the EBA have been estimated at 0.5% of the annual contributions paid to them. Such costs include, for example but not exclusively, the costs related to the assessment of the annual programming and budget, the participation of DG FISMA's representatives in Management Boards, Boards of Supervisors and related preparatory work.  2.3. Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities  For the purpose of combating fraud, corruption and any other illegal activity, the provisions of Regulation (EU, Euratom) N°883/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 September 2013 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) apply to the ESAs without any restriction. The ESAs have a dedicated anti-fraud strategy and resulting action plan. The ESAs' actions in the area of anti-fraud will be compliant with the Financial Regulation, OLAF’s fraud prevention policies, the provisions provided by the Commission Anti-Fraud Strategy (COM(2019)196) as well as the Common Approach on EU decentralised agencies (July 2012) and the related roadmap. In addition, the Regulations establishing the ESAs as well as the ESAs' Financial Regulations set out the provisions on implementation and control of the ESAs' budgets and applicable financial rules, including those aimed at preventing fraud and irregularities.  3.

For this, it is estimated that 2 skilled and permanent FTEs would be necessary to carry out these tasks, 1 at EBA and 1 at ESMA. These tasks require a good knowledge on insolvency law as well as on financial market infrastructure legislation. The FTEs need to be able to assess the reasoning of Member States’ competent authorities as to how the compatibility of the rules of a system is in line with the (national) insolvency law and ensure that Member States have designated EU systems in a consistent way, also taking into account sectorial legislation. This is the case for EU systems as well as third-country systems.  ESMA is required to establish and run over time an electronic central database as required under Article 26 of the SFR. The central database facilitates the exchange of information and documents relevant to the recipients under this Regulation, including the designation and registration of EU and third-country systems, as well as the publication of certain information. Article 26 also provides for access for the competent authorities, registration authorities and national competent authorities for payment, settlement and clearing systems. Given the EBA, in close cooperation with the ESCB, is responsible for payments systems, central banks and the EBA will also require access.  The central database will require ESMA to set up appropriate IT infrastructure to ensure the safe, efficient and effective transmission and storage of the information, documents, and communication between relevant stakeholders (e.g. designated systems, competent authorities , etc.) as prescribed under the SFR. The central database required under the SFR should be the same system as that required under Article 17c of EMIR , Article 21a of the CSDR , Article 38ea of MiFIR, and Article 35c of the ESMA Regulation . Since this central database is established under an earlier mandate, i.e. Regulation (EU) 2024/2987 (‘EMIR 3’), the costs associated with the set-up and ongoing maintenance of the central database under the SFR should only reflect the relative increase in those costs in order for the central database to be implemented as required under the SFR. This includes the added cost of facilitating access for the additional stakeholders required to have access to the central database under the SFR (approximately 60 entities), as well as the cost of storage for the additional information, documentation, and communications that would be kept in and/or transmitted via the database. These costs are incorporated into the figures provided in the Master Regulation document 46 related to the “ESMA Central Database and supervisory platform for CCPs, CSDs and TVs” (see Section 4.3 of the Master Regulation, as well as Parts D and E of the section on Specific Assumptions in the Annex of that Regulation) and are thus not presented separately here.  Cost estimates:  The calculation for the costs of are based on DG BUDG guidance for the category of personnel: Contract agent, based on the average cost of a temporary agent in 2025 (i.e. €0.084 million) and featuring:  An inflation rate of 2% starting in 2027;  A salary correction coefficient for Paris, where both ESMA and the EBA are located, of 114,2%;  An amount of 30.000 EUR/year corresponding to operating expenditure, mainly building and IT related costs, is included, as per 2025 standard price, subject to an inflation of 2%.  The above expenditures will be financed: 1/ for EBA, up to 40% via a Commission subsidy and up to 60% by the national competent authorities (NCA), in accordance with this ESAs’ founding Regulation; 2/ for ESMA, up to 50% via a Commission subsidy and up to 50% by the national competent authorities (NCA) strictly as it concerns new additional tasks required by the SIU package.

This proposal seeks to replace the existing Settlement Finality Directive, ensuring that once transactions are entered into a designated system, they cannot be reversed, even if a participant becomes insolvent. The primary goals are to provide legal certainty, reduce systemic risks, and facilitate smoother financial operations across the EU. This initiative is part of a broader effort to create a Savings and Investments Union, making Europe a more attractive destination for investment by addressing the need for risk capital in strategic sectors.

The proposal aims to eliminate legal uncertainties and reduce costs associated with cross-border financial transactions, fostering a more integrated and resilient European capital market. It seeks to enhance liquidity, spur innovation, and provide better financial products and services to EU citizens. The existing Settlement Finality Directive has faced challenges due to its national transposition, resulting in significant divergences that undermine its effectiveness in fostering a coherent and integrated European post-trade landscape. Member States have adopted different approaches to the designation of systems, creating inconsistencies in the scope of protection available to participants, with varying definitions and treatment of participants and indirect participants.

To address these issues, the proposal supports the correct and safe functioning of the single market, safeguarding competition and preserving financial stability. It introduces a common definition and harmonized approach to system designation, with the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) playing a key role."

CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  Reviving the EU’s economy and strengthening i t s international position are central to the European Commission ’s mandate. As stated in the Draghi and Letta reports 1 and in the 2024-2029 Commission political guidelines 2 , urgent action is required to improve economic performance and to ensure that the EU can decide its own future. The Competitiveness Compass 3 sets out a comprehensive plan to streng th en the EU’s econom y and harness its potential , with the Savings and Investments Union (SIU) acting as a key enabler for this plan . In March 2025, the Commission unveiled its S IU strategy 4 . It aims to make it easier for citizens to grow their wealth by investing in capital markets, to increase the investment capacity in the EU, and to integrate the EU’s capital markets . By breaking down barriers in financial markets and facilitating cross-border capital flows, the SIU strategy can support the EU economy, stimulate job creation, and enhance competitiveness .  The need for urgent action has been widely recognised at the highest political level , including in statements and calls to action from the European Parliament 5 , the European Council 6 , the Eurogroup 7 , the Euro Summit 8 , and the European Central Bank (ECB) 9 . T he International Monetary Fund (‘IMF’) 10 and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (‘OECD’) 11 have also called for action to address remaining barriers to financial market integration .  Implementing the SIU requires comprehensive policy measures that will have an impact on various aspects of the EU’s financial system, with a holistic approach encompassing both the capital markets and the banking sector. These measures are grouped into four interconnected pillars: (i) citizens and savings, (ii) investments and financing, (iii) market integration and scale; and (iv) efficient supervision. This legislative initiative focuses on market integration and scale, and efficient supervision.  This legislative initiative focuses on barriers stemming from the lack of harmonisation of EU rules and supervisory approaches resulting in the fragmentation and underperformance of EU capital markets. These barriers hinder market-driven efforts to expand business and build scale across the single market through cross-border activities. They also hinder the use of innovative digital technologies in three areas that are essential for the smooth and efficient functioning of EU capital markets, namely trading, post-trading and asset management.  Despite the harmonisation of regulatory frameworks and the existence of financial services passports, persistent fragmentation as a result of these barriers limits the potential benefits of the EU's single market. These barriers arise from differences in regulatory approaches, often reflecting the use of discretions in the transposition and interpretation of EU directives and varying approaches to supervision. These barriers unnecessarily complicate the cross-border activities of financial market participants. As a result, either they cannot fully benefit from economies of scale and improved operational efficiency or there is no sufficient incentive for them to facilitate cross-border investments. This raises costs, delays time to market, restricts the choice of financial products and services available to businesses and the public, and makes those products and services more expensive.  This initiative also emphasises the importance of technological developments and innovation in the financial sector. Regulatory barriers are hindering the uptake and use of newer-generation technologies, such as distributed ledger technology (DLT) and tokenisation of financial instruments. Such technologies have the potential to improve financial services for people and businesses.  Divergent supervisory practices can also act as a barrier to capital market integration, as financial market participants operating across borders must manage different requirements across the single market. This fragmentation of supervisory practices creates additional costs, increased complexity and legal uncertainty for operators, especially those who intend to do business and invest across the EU. The legal uncertainty and the uneven playing field that this creates makes the EU a less appealing investment destination.  Objectives of the proposal  The general objective of this initiative is to integrate EU capital markets and improve the functioning of the EU single market in financial services for the benefit of investors, businesses and the wider EU economy. This contributes to the SIU’s core objective to enable access to a wider range of financial opportunities for investors and businesses and to mobilise savings for productive investment.  The initiative will contribute to achieving the general objective through the following specific objectives.  Enable further market integration and scale effects  The proposed amendments aim to remove barriers to integration in the core sectors of trading, post-trading and asset management, and improve the ability of market actors to operate more seamlessly across Member States, thereby enabling market integration and scale. It will foster competition, ensuring that scale benefits are effectively passed on to end users.  Enable integrated supervision  More efficient and harmonised supervision is essential to integrate EU capital markets. As progress is made towards deeper capital market integration, it is crucial for the EU supervisory framework to evolve in lock step. The initiative therefore aims to address the shortcomings and inefficiencies in the current supervisory framework, by tackling inconsistencies and complexities arising from fragmented national supervisory approaches. It aims to make supervision more effective, more conducive to cross-border activities, and more responsive to emerging risks, while reducing unnecessary burdens on firms. For certain significant and cross-border entities in the areas of trading and post-trading, and for entities in new areas like crypto-asset service providers, pooling supervision at EU level can promote market integration and more efficient functioning of the capital markets. For large asset management groups and investment funds, stronger convergence and coordination of supervision at EU level will remove barriers and increase cross-border activities. Across the board, the initiative aims to strengthen the use and effectiveness of the supervisory convergence tools of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), and introduce new tools, thereby supporting a single market for financial service.  Facilitate innovation  The proposed amendments also aims to remove regulatory obstacles to DLT-based innovation, with a view to creating a framework to enable the use of new technologies in the provision of financial services. For innovation to thrive, both the DLT Pilot Regime and the standard rulebook should allow the industry to use DLT to bring efficient solutions to the market, while ensuring that associated risks are mitigated. By removing these barriers, the proposed amendments also aim to increase competition in the area of trading and post-trading services, which will lead to improved market outcomes and enhancing capital market efficiency.  Achieve simplification  The review of specific legislative files presents an opportunity to simplify by reducing administrative burdens. The package aims to streamline regulatory requirements, making cross-border activities more cost-effective. Simplification is pursued in several ways: moving certain provisions from directives to regulations; narrowing the scope for nationally imposed ‘gold-plating’ measures; refining Level 2 empowerments; streamlining overlapping, costly and inefficient supervisory arrangements; and more generally removing barriers in EU and national frameworks for market operators and investors.  The market integration and supervision package comprises three legislative proposals, namely: proposals for a Master Regulation and a Master Directive which amend several existing pieces of EU capital market legislation, and a proposal for a Settlement Finality Regulation, which amends the Financial Collateral Directive and repeals the Settlement Finality Directive.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  The proposed amendments in this package are consistent with existing provisions in the field of financial services. They aim to foster stronger market integration and achieve efficiency gains by: (i) removing barriers to cross-border activity and innovation, (ii) increasing regulatory and supervisory convergence; and (iii) strengthening supervisory capacity in the relevant sectors. These amendments are consistent with the goals of competition, efficient functioning of the single market in financial services, and promoting the freedom to provide services across the EU, without compromising financial stability, market integrity or investor protection. This ensures that the EU financial market remains safe and globally attractive. Implementing these amendments as a package allows to ensure consistency across sectoral legislations under review. The proposed amendments also seek to address shortcomings and inefficiencies in the current supervisory framework by tackling the inconsistencies and complexities arising from fragmented national supervisory approaches.  • Consistency with other Union policies  This proposal is consistent with the core objective of the SIU strategy, which is to enable access to a wider range of financial opportunities for investors and businesses, thereby mobilising savings for productive investment. This proposal is interlinked with other initiatives included in the SIU strategy, for instance the initiatives on pensions, on increasing retail participation in capital markets, and on market-based financing of the real economy. These initiatives are designed to reinforce each other and collectively contribute to the overall goals. Other measures in the SIU strategy, such as the financial literacy strategy, the recommendation on savings and investment accounts, the measure to promote equity investments, including through legislative programmes, and the measures on supplementary pensions will be less effective if the barriers to further integration of EU capital markets are not removed and continue to impose high costs on investors and businesses.  The proposal is also consistent with the EU policy to enhance Europe’s competitiveness, the strategy outlined in the Competitiveness Compass, the single market strategy, the EU start-up and scale-up strategy, and the Communication on a Simpler and Faster Europe.  The proposed amendments will boost the attractiveness of EU capital markets, thereby helping to finance the EU’s priorities. They will do so, in particular: (i) by further harmonising the rules; (ii) making it easier for trading venues, financial market infrastructures and investment funds to operate and provide services across borders, thus reducing costs for all market participants; and (iii) as regards innovation, by ensuring that the DLT Pilot Regime, which is designed to support DLT-based innovation in financial services, and post-trade legislation remain fit for purpose for innovation.  This package is also consistent with, and will contribute to, the Commission’s simplification agenda and the single market strategy. It will do so, in particular: (i) by harmonising and streamlining some of the rules applicable to trading, post-trading and investment funds; and (ii) by moving part of the requirements applicable to those sectors from Directives to Regulations.  By removing barriers to further integration of capital markets, the measures under this initiative complement other EU initiatives, such as the 28th regime. By streamlining cross-border offering of trading, post trading services and asset management services, thereby simplifying access to public markets, this option enhances the ability of companies operating under a 28th regime to leverage the benefits of a more integrated EU capital market even more effectively.  Finally, this initiative is in line with the Commission’s d igital f inance s trategy 12 , which support s the deployment of new technologies in financial services , by ambitious ly adapt ing the existing rule s to accommodate new technologies, such as DLT.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) confers on the European Parliament and the Council the competence to adopt measures for the approximation of the provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States which relate to the establishment and functioning of the internal market. Article 114 TFEU allows the EU to take measures to eliminate existing barriers to the exercise of fundamental freedoms and to prevent such barriers from emerging. This includes barriers that make it difficult for economic operators, including investors, to take full advantage of the benefits of the internal market.  The amendments contribute to the correct and safe functioning of the single market, safeguard competition and preserve incentives for innovation. Consequently, the appropriate legal basis is Article 114 TFEU.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  Under Article 4 of TFEU, EU action to complete the internal market must be appraised in light of the subsidiarity principle set out in Article 5(3) of the Treaty on European Union. According to the principle of subsidiarity, action should be taken at EU level only when the objectives of the proposed action cannot be achieved sufficiently by Member States alone and thus require action at EU level.  The proposed amendments comply with the subsidiarity principle. They aim to tackle the existing barriers to the cross-border provision of services preventing the creation of a genuine single market for capital.  National action alone cannot resolve these challenges. The diversity of Member States’ legal frameworks, supervisory traditions and market structures means that reforms undertaken individually would not deliver the necessary convergence of regulatory and supervisory standards and market practices. Action at EU level is therefore required to remove those barriers, enhance market integration and facilitate market integration.  • Proportionality  The initiative involves a broad review of the rules on trading, post-trading, asset management and investment funds to harmonise and streamline the requirements for businesses. This includes easing some requirements for cross-border groups and services provided on a cross-border basis, under a single license. In the settlement area, interconnectedness between central securities depositories (CSDs) would also be improved. The review also includes amendments to post-trade legislation to make it more technologically neutral, and to the DLT Pilot Regime (DLTPR), to expand its scope and scale, and to make it more flexible and proportionate. Investment funds would gain immediate and full single market access upon authorisation, which would enable them to operate more efficiently across borders. On supervision, the amendments aim to strengthen the use and effectiveness of supervisory convergence tools and powers, focusing on ESMA and its governance. Supervisory powers would also be transferred to ESMA for the most significant and cross-border market infrastructures (central counterparties, CSDs and trading venues) and for all crypto-asset service providers (CASPs). ESMA would also have a reinforced role in fostering supervisory convergence for undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) and alternative investment funds (AIFs) marketed on a cross-border basis.  To the extent that divergences in the application of EU rules as well as differences between Member States’ national laws create market inefficiencies and burdens, the amendments will create a more harmonised and proportionate application of the EU rules for cross-border activities.  • Choice of the instrument  It is proposed to implement the measures through a proposal for a Regulation amending the following acts: the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (MiFIR), the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR), the Central Securities Depository Regulation (CSDR), the Cross-Border Distribution Regulation (CBDR), the DLT Pilot Regime Regulation, the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation and the ESMA Regulation. To ensure appropriate alignment with the substantive amendments in those Regulations, amendments will also be made to the Securities Financing Transactions Regulation and the CCP Recovery and Resolution Regulation. A Regulation is the most appropriate legal instrument because the proposed amendments are inter-linked and are part of a broader political effort to create a single market for capital by harmonising the rules and removing barriers to cross-border activities in the financial sectors that form the backbone of capital markets financing. Combining the amendments in a legislative package helps ensure that the overall text is consistent.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT  • Ex-post evaluations / fitness checks of existing legislation  Currently, there are no effective solutions to ensure cross-border provision of services in the sectors that fall within the scope of this package or they are hampered by divergent national rules. Moreover, the EU rules need to be updated to make it easier to provide financial services using new technologies, in particular DLT, which can improve the efficiency of the capital markets.  Non-aligned supervisory practices and weak supervisory convergence tools and powers at EU level exacerbate these issues. These barriers lead to market inefficiencies, limited economies of scale, reduced liquidity in capital markets, increased costs for investors, restricted access to a broader investor base across borders, and higher capital costs for EU companies, ultimately undermining the productivity and competitiveness of the EU economy.  In the trading area, rules governing trading venues are not fully harmonised, and subject to a certain degree of national discretion. Passporting opportunities for regulated markets are not explicitly spelled out, leaving room for Member States to set additional requirements in their national laws. Differences in transposition in national laws and the possibility for additional gold-plating by Member States makes the overall regulatory landscape complex, in particular for cross-border entities or groups. It creates legal uncertainty and an uneven playing field among Member States, preventing the emergence of trading structures that operate in several Member States. To address barriers linked to supervisory fragmentation, the relevant provisions of the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation should be amended to introduce direct EU-level supervision of certain trading venues.  In the post-trading area, settlement markets need to be more integrated and greater use needs to be made of T2S to facilitate cross-border activity by issuers, CSDs and investors. Even though settlement is governed by a Regulation (the Central Securities Depository Regulation), regulatory barriers to cross-border settlement persist. For instance, national legislation may impose additional restrictions on the freedom of issuance beyond those included in the Central Securities Depository Regulation provisions. Additionally, the passporting framework, intended to facilitate cross-border operations, is considered costly and burdensome for CSDs. The Central Securities Depository Regulation does not adequately consider market infrastructure groups from an operational, regulatory and supervisory perspective. This makes it difficult for them to reap the benefits of consolidation and achieve economies of scale. There is therefore a need to harmonise requirements for cross-border businesses and to streamline requirements and reduce operational complexity in the EU settlement infrastructures (i.e. CSDs, including the T2S costs passed on by CSDs), to gain efficiency and reduce costs. Moreover, the Central Securities Depository Regulation needs to be amended to make it more technologically neutral and address legal uncertainty around key concepts, definitions and requirements that have not kept pace with technological advances. To address barriers linked to supervisory fragmentation, the relevant provisions of the Central Securities Depository Regulation should be amended to introduce direct EU-level supervision of certain post-trading infrastructures.  In the asset management area, the marketing of UCITS funds and AIFs is mainly governed by Directives, which allow for national discretions in many areas. The cross-border marketing of UCITS and AIFs is currently time-consuming and administratively difficult to manage. Many Member States have country-specific requirements for marketing communications and disclosures in fund documentation, as well as specific administrative and operational requirements (such as additional marketing rules, regulatory fees, reporting obligations, and local physical presence requirements). These hinder the development of an effective EU passport for investment funds in the Union. Furthermore, the Cross-Border Distribution Regulation (the CBDR) acknowledges that Member States have different rules on regulatory fees and charges and provides optionality on the ex-ante verification of marketing communications. There is therefore a need to significantly reduce diverging national practices in the marketing of funds across the Union, as well as presenting the rules relating to the cross-border distribution of funds in a more efficient way, i.e. within the same legal text, in order to foster greater harmonisation in the cross-border marketing of UCITS and AIFs. This approach involves amendments to the CBDR and transferring certain provisions (with amendments) from the Directives 2009/65/EC and 2011/61/EU into the CBDR. To reduce supervisory fragmentation and improve collaboration between national competent authorities, ESMA’s role in addressing cross-border barriers and resolving disagreements between the home and host national authorities should be reinforced.  In the innovation area, there are two main obstacles related to implementing DLT-based solutions in Europe. First, the DLT Pilot Regime Regulation places a heavy compliance burden on small businesses and start-ups, particularly due to relying on extensive requirements in the Central Securities Depository Regulation and Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, that may not be well-suited to the gradual scaling-up of operations and the specific characteristics of DLT. The DLT Pilot Regime Regulation also imposes stringent limitations on the scope and scale of the activities of participants in the pilot regime. It does so, for example, by introducing aggregate limits to the activity of an infrastructure operating under the Regulation and restricting the type and issuance size of assets that can be intermediated under the Regulation. Furthermore, market participants do not have clarity about the long-term prospects for the DLT Pilot Regime, given its experimental nature and the time limitations set out in the Regulation. Second, beyond the shortcomings of Europe’s bespoke framework for DLT, the standard (non-DLTPR) regulatory frameworks, in particular post-trade legislation do not currently provide legal certainty for those wishing to use DLT outside the DLTPR. These uncertainties increase compliance risks and costs for market participants willing to explore innovative business models.  On supervision, there are two main issues. First, supervision of financial entities is largely conducted at national level. This results in a fragmented supervisory landscape that creates barriers to cross-border activities because of divergent application of EU law and divergent supervisory practices, approaches and requirements. Enforcement actions, such as infringements, can address specific instances of non-compliance, and peer reviews aim to strengthen supervisory convergence, but they are not sufficient to address the underlying issues of non-aligned supervisory practices. Second, there are limited mandates and tools available at the EU level to enforce consistent application of EU rules and adopt a unified single market supervisory approach. The use of supervisory convergence tools remains sporadic. They have limitations, are not used consistently and can be difficult to use due to procedural constraints, and lack of enforceability.  • Stakeholder consultations  The following consultation activities have helped to shape the content of this proposal:  · European Commission ‘Call for evidence on the Savings and Investments Union: Fostering integration and scale and more efficient supervision in EU capital markets’, from 8 May to 5 June 2025 ;  · European Commission targeted consultation on ‘Integration of EU capital markets’ from 15 April to 10 June 2025.  The call for evidence generated 53 responses from a broad range of stakeholders. Business associations formed the largest group, accounting for 62.3% of responses, and representing the investment, banking and asset management industries. Companies and businesses, primarily from the financial sector, accounted for 20.8%. Individual members of the public accounted for 9.4% of responses, while other categories, including chambers of commerce, professional associations and advisory firms, accounted for 5.7%, and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) accounted for 1.9%.  The purpose of the call for evidence was to (i) gather stakeholders’ views on barriers that prevent the EU’s trading and post-trading infrastructures from reaping the benefits of a truly frictionless single market; (ii) examine whether the current regulatory and supervisory setting is fit for the capital markets and in particular for market operators with strong cross-border activities or operating in new or emerging sectors; and (iii) review the European Supervisory Authorities’ toolbox to assess areas where its effectiveness and efficiency can be strengthened and improved.  Across all stakeholder groups, there was broad agreement on the need for more integrated capital markets and enhanced supervisory convergence. This was accompanied by a shared call for simplification, proportionality and legal certainty. Stakeholders widely recognised that a more integrated and efficient financial ecosystem would enhance Europe’s competitiveness, improve access to finance, and expand investment opportunities. Nonetheless, they stressed that reforms must remain balanced, transparent and inclusive, demonstrating tangible benefits for citizens and the real economy. The level of support for centralising supervision at EU level varied significantly among stakeholders. Business associations and companies tended to prefer incremental progress within the current institutional structure, while NGOs and some members of the public favoured stronger EU-level oversight to ensure consistency and accountability.  In addition to the call for evidence, the targeted consultation on ‘Integration of EU capital markets’ gathered views from a broad group of stakeholders on various aspects of the EU capital markets. The online questionnaire was structured in two parts. Part 1 covered simplification and burden reduction of the EU regulatory framework in the trading, post-trading and asset management sectors, barriers to cross-border operations in the trading space and to liquidity deepening in EU capital markets, and barriers to cross-border provisions of post-trade services. Part 2 included questions on: cross-sectoral barriers in the trading and post-trading sectors (e.g. relating to innovation, group synergies, issuance of financial instruments); barriers to cross-border provision of asset management services and investment funds; and barriers specifically linked to supervision.  In total, 297 stakeholders replied to the targeted consultation through the Commission website. The majority of contributions came from business associations (31%) and companies or business entities (27%), followed by public authorities (12%). Additional input was received from NGOs (4%), EU citizens (3%), trade unions (2%), and one consumer organisation. The consultation thus attracted a diverse range of respondents from the industry, including market participants, representative associations and public authorities.  In parallel, bilateral meetings were held with selected stakeholders to gather additional input and explore specific concerns in greater depth. The Commission also introduced various aspects of the review at a meeting with representatives of the European Parliament and Member State financial services attachés in October and November 2025.  The results of the call for evidence and targeted consultation have been considered in the proposal and the Commission has sought to take account of the different stakeholder interests expressed. The most significant areas where respondents identified scope for improvements were examined and have been included in the proposal. These include calls for a more proportionate, simpler and more harmonised regulatory framework that reduces burdens and eliminates barriers in the areas of trading, post-trading and cross-border distribution of investment funds, as well as increasing the efficiency and convergence of supervision of financial entities.  • Collection and use of expertise  When preparing this initiative, the Commission consulted several studies and sources of information. The Commission organised in September 2024 a round-table discussion on consolidation in the investment funds sector and trading and post-trading infrastructure with private and public stakeholders, and experts in those sectors. The Commission has also organised separate bilateral outreach to key stakeholders and workshops with the industry. The studies used to prepare this proposal have been referenced in the impact assessment accompanying this proposal and documenting the barriers that this package is trying to address.  • Impact assessment  In line with the Better Regulation policy, the Commission conducted an impact assessment of policy alternatives. Beyond the option of no EU action (Baseline scenario – Option 1), two packages of policy options were identified based on a call for evidence, a targeted consultation, other stakeholder engagements, a study on consolidation and reducing fragmentation in trading and post-trading infrastructures in Europe, a study of barriers to, and drivers of, the scaling-up of funds investing in innovative and growth companies, literature reviews, and previous initiatives and reports documenting the most significant barriers to the integration of EU capital markets that have been existing for several years and have not yet been fully addressed.  Option 1 is the baseline option of doing nothing. Option 2 involves a broad review of the trading, post-trading and asset management rulebooks to harmonise and streamline requirements for business operations, including easing some requirements within groups and for services provided on a cross-border basis, under a single license. In the settlement area, interconnectedness between central securities depositories (CSDs) would also be improved.  Option 2 would also include amendments to post-trade legislation to make it more technologically neutral as well as to the DLT pilot regime (DLTPR) to expand its scope and scale. Investment funds would gain immediate and full single market access upon authorisation, and asset management groups would be able to operate more efficiently across borders. On supervision, Option 2 aims to strengthen the use and effectiveness of supervisory convergence tools and powers, focusing on the European Securities and Markets Authorities (ESMA) and its governance. This option also involves transferring supervisory powers to ESMA for the most significant infrastructures (central counterparties, CSDs and trading venues) and for all the crypto-asset service providers (CASPs), and to have ESMA coordinating the supervision of large asset managers and investment funds.  Option 3 builds on Option 2 but is more far-reaching with additional elements to establish an integrated market, such as, for instance, mandatory connection between significant trading venues, mandating links between CSDs, creating group-level authorisation for asset managers, full flexibility in the DLTPR, ESMA direct supervision of all infrastructures, asset managers and CASPs.  The analysis assesses the options in relation to three objectives: (i) enabling further market integration and scale effects; (ii) enabling integrated supervision; and (iii) facilitating innovation. It shows that the additional elements in Option 3 would imply higher costs for the sectors and for supervisors, outweighing the potential benefits. In addition, this option is less coherent with other EU policy initiatives and may have unintended consequences on competition and on financial stability risks.  The assessment concludes that Option 2 is the preferred policy package as it delivers significant integration benefits while remaining proportionate in terms of costs and subsidiarity. It combines extensive harmonisation of requirements in the relevant trading, post-trading and asset management frameworks and removal of barriers to cross-border activities, with stronger supervisory convergence tools and powers and EU-level supervision of the most significant infrastructures. These aspects reinforce one another. The harmonisation of rules in this package would facilitate the transfer of supervision of some operators and markets to the EU level and, in the case of CASPs, for all entities, and allow better enforcement of the single rulebook.  By removing undue regulatory barriers to integration, the measures under this option would ease regulatory burdens and operational complexity, thereby improving the efficiency of providing services across borders and fostering market integration. Implementation costs would fall mainly on infrastructures and national authorities. This option would also require significant resources and infrastructure development at ESMA, the majority of it would be fee funded. But all these costs are expected to be outweighed by efficiency gains and simplification in the medium term. The initiative would reduce legal uncertainty for issuers and investors, lower compliance costs and improve predictability. Increased flexibility in the DLT-pilot regime and changes in sectoral legislation to make it more compatible with DLT would encourage greater uptake of this technology. Stronger supervisory convergence and a more integrated supervisory framework would level the playing field, limit regulatory arbitrage and reduce the administrative burden related to cross-border activities.  The initiative will facilitate investors’ access to a wide range of investment opportunities and enable companies to raise capital across borders, including SMEs. It will therefore contribute to improve how we mobilise capital in Europe and allow the right financing ecosystem to emerge in order to support EU strategic priorities and make our economy stronger, more competitive.  The Regulatory Scrutiny Board issued a positive assessment of the impact assessment following a first negative opinion. To address the comments raised by the Board, the impact assessment has been revised in order to: (i) clarify the rationale for the initiative’s scope and its role within the broader SIU strategy, including its interplay with other initiatives; (ii) streamline the sections on the problem definition and problem drivers; (iii) improve the explanations related to DLT-based innovation; (iv) clarify the intervention logic and the objectives. The text has also been revised to strengthen the analysis of the magnitude of the problems, based on additional quantitative inputs received from stakeholders and on other existing studies, to better assess costs/benefits. The text is also more transparent about the limitation in data availabilities and out-of-scope factors that make a full robust modelling of the costs and benefits not possible. Stakeholder views have also been reflected more comprehensively through the text, and the impact of the proposed measures on different stakeholder groups better captured.  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  The measures proposed will ease regulatory burdens and operational complexity, thereby improving the efficiency of providing services across borders and fostering market- integration. Implementation costs will fall mainly on infrastructures and national authorities. ESMA will also need significant resources and infrastructure development. But all these costs are expected to be outweighed by efficiency gains and simplification in the medium term. The initiative will reduce legal uncertainty for issuers and investors, lower compliance costs and improve predictability. Increased flexibility in the DLT Pilot Regime and changes in sectoral legislation to make it more compatible with DLT will encourage greater uptake of this technology. Stronger supervisory convergence and a more integrated supervisory framework will level the playing field and reduce the administrative burden related to cross-border activities. Simplification will be achieved in several ways: transitioning certain provisions from directives to regulations; eliminating scope for nationally imposed ‘gold-plating’ measures;  streamlining overlapping, costly and inefficient supervisory arrangements; and more generally removing barriers in the EU and national frameworks for market operators and investors. With a view to simplifying the regulatory framework and reducing regulatory and administrative burdens, this proposal refines Level 2 empowerments by deleting and updating empowerments including those, which following the consultations with the European Parliament, the Council and European Supervisory Authorities were considered non-essential for the effective functioning of the corresponding provisions in the basic acts. Furthermore, the Commission has, in this proposal, sought to limit as much as possible the number of new Level 2 empowerments.  • Fundamental rights  The proposal respects fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, in particular the right to provide services in any Member State (Article 15(2), the freedom to conduct a business (Article 16), the right to property (Article 17), access to services of general economic interest to promote social and territorial cohesion within the Union (Article 36), and consumer protection (Article 38).  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  The financial and budgetary impact of this package is explained in detail in the legislative financial statement annexed to the Master Regulation. It also includes the financial and budgetary impacts of the Master Directive.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  The Commission will monitor progress towards achieving the specific objectives based on the non-exhaustive list of indicators listed in Section 9 of the accompanying impact assessment. The list focuses on the indicators per sector, but broader indicators to measure the wider impact on the market will also be monitored, even if those can be less directly attributed to this initiative. Such indicators include measures assessing access to capital and corporate financing structures or the level of retail investor participation in capital market.  Ex-post evaluation of all new legislative measures is a priority for the Commission. The Commission services will review the outputs, results and impacts of this initiative once the legal instrument has entered into force. After five years, the Commission will carry out the next evaluation of the amendments contained in this proposal, in line with the Commission’s Better Regulation Guidelines.  • Explanatory documents (for directives)  No explanatory documents are considered necessary.  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  This Master Regulation consists of amendments to:  · Regulation (EU) No 1095 /2010 (ESMA Regulation ; Article 1) ;  · Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 ( EMIR; Article 2) ;  · Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 (MiFIR ; Article 3) ;  · Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 (CSDR ; Article 4) ;  · Re gulation (EU) 2015/2365 ( SFTR; Article 5) ;  · Regulation (EU) 2019/1156 ( CBDR ; Article 6 ) ;  · Regulation (EU) 2021/23 ( CCPRRR; Article 7) ;  · Regulation (EU) 2022/858 ( DLTPR ; Article 8 ) ;  · Regulation ( EU) 2023/1114 ( MiCA ; Article 9 ) ;  · Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 (CRA Regulation; Article 10);  · Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 ( Benchmarks Regulation; Article 11);  · Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 (Securitisation Regulation; Article 12);  · Regulation (EU) 2023/2631 (European Green Bonds Regulation; Article 13); and  · Regulation (EU) 2024/3005 (ESG Ratings Regulation; Article 14) .  Article 1 – Amendments to ESMA Regulation  The proposed amendments to Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 (the ESMA Regulation) aim to strengthen ESMA’s mandate, governance and funding to ensure more consistent, transparent and accountable supervision across the EU. This will create better conditions for market integration, generate efficiency gains and increase investors’ trust in the single market.  In terms of tasks and powers the proposed amendments adopt a twofold approach: (i) a proposal to transfer supervisory powers to ESMA for significant market infrastructure entities and CASPs; and (ii) amendments to increase the use and effectiveness of supervisory convergence tools. These changes are underpinned by a review of ESMA’s governance and funding arrangements to ensure that decision-making at EU level is simple, independent and efficient and that appropriate resources are available to implement the new objectives.  General tasks and powers  The amendments to Articles 1, 4 and 8 aim to clarify the scope of the Regulation and provide updated definitions to reflect the new direct supervisory responsibilities. The changes also bring ESMA’s mandate into line with the objectives of promoting innovation, data driven supervision and effective enforcement.  The new Article 8a on the duty of cooperation emphasises the importance of cooperation between ESMA and authorities. The aim is to promote greater collaboration, information-sharing, and mutual support and create a framework for structured yet flexible cooperation between ESMA and other competent or relevant authorities. In particular, this would ensure that ESMA can carry out its direct supervisory tasks smoothly, effectively, and proportionately, while safeguarding its independence. It is proposed that ESMA will establish flexible practical arrangements for cooperation , tailored to specific sectors and tasks, and guided by the principles of efficiency, proportionality and mutual trust. These arrangements may include joint supervisory teams, joint inspections, or operational coordination. They should allow for gradual adjustments over time. Arrangements for cooperation should prioritise effective and resource-efficient supervision, continuity and consistency of supervisory outcomes, and respect for the statutory responsibilities and resources of other authorities. The new Article 8a will enable ESMA and other authorities to work more effectively together, leveraging their collective expertise and resources to address the complex challenges facing the EU's financial system. This, in turn, will contribute to a more integrated, stable, and prosperous European financial market.  To ensure effective supervision, the amendments to Article 9a broaden the scope of ESMA’s power to issue ""no action letters"" to cater for specific circumstances where the application of a legislative act raises significant issues for market participants. The aim is to provide clarity and guidance to market participants and reduce the risk of inconsistent application of EU law.  The amendments to Articles 10 and 15 give the Commission the power to adopt an amending delegated or implementing act even if ESMA does not provide a draft. This addresses a current gap in the procedural framework for the adoption of technical standards. The proposed amendments also establish a procedure for temporarily suspending regulatory or implementing standards (or parts of them) under specific conditions. These procedures aim to make ESMA’s regulatory powers more flexible and adaptable and should allow the Commission to improve rulemaking and increase responsiveness to new market developments, thereby ensuring the smooth functioning of the financial markets.  The a mendments to Articles 8(2), 17 and 19(4) clarify that, in accordance with the Corneli judgment 13 , ESMA must apply Union law . This includes national laws that implement EU Directives, which sh ould be interpreted in a way that is consistent with those Directives.  Article 17aa gives ESMA a new power in the area of supervisory convergence to require a competent authority to seek its opinion in cases where a peer review or investigation has identified serious supervisory failures. Furthermore, ESMA will have the power to require prompt and effective corrective actions to be taken to address supervisory shortcomings. The aim of this new safeguard measure is to allow ESMA to act in cases where products or entities would be granted access to the EU market without adequate supervision or where supervisory arbitrage would undermine the passport system.  Article 19a introduces collaboration platforms between competent authorities, that will enhance cooperation and supervision of cross-border activities. This builds on the successful experience with similar platforms under the Solvency II Directive. These platforms will facilitate information exchange, propose solutions and promote a culture of collaboration. ESMA will have the power to resolve any disputes.  Articles 28a and 28b provide for a mechanism to be set up for the mutual recognition of administrative fines and assistance with their recovery in a cross-border context. The aim is to make it easier to enforce the rules in the single market, in contrast to the current situation, in which recovering fines in another jurisdiction is very complex or even impossible.  Supervisory powers  To ensure effective and consistent supervision across sectors, it is proposed to insert a new Chapter IIa which consolidates ESMA's procedural powers as currently set out in sectoral legislation into a single, cross-sectoral framework. This framework streamlines the rules for information requests, investigations, on-site inspections, supervisory measures, and penalties, while safeguarding rights of defence, legal professional privilege, and judicial protection. By establishing a consistent and uniform set of procedural powers, the Regulation increases legal certainty, promotes supervisory convergence and efficiency, and helps ESMA's to exercise its direct supervisory responsibilities accountably. These powers are without prejudice to any more specific or different powers set out in other EU Acts.  Funding  To ensure the ESMA’s supervisory activities are financed in a fair and transparent manner, the Regulation proposes to harmonise the principles governing the fees charged to financial market participants under ESMA’s supervision ( Article 39n ). The Regulation consolidates the principles currently scattered across sectoral legislation in order to establish a unified framework for fee calculation, scope and transparency. The proposed amendments promote legal certainty and transparency for both existing and new entities, thereby enabling them to better anticipate and plan for supervisory fees. The proposed amendments ultimately help ESMA to effectively supervise and regulate the financial sector.  An amendment has also been made to Regulation (EU) 2015/2365 to bring it into line with the changes to the fees charged to financial market participants by ESMA.  Governance  This proposal provides for a more effective governance structure for ESMA. It replaces the current Management Board with an Executive Board with independent full-time members (Articles 44a and 46a) and adjusts the composition of the Board of Supervisors (Article 40). The proposal clarifies the respective responsibilities of these two boards (Articles 43 and 46a). The Executive Board will consist of the chairperson and 5 full-time members, with diverse supervisory experiences, and, collectively, an appropriate understanding of the sectors under ESMA’s supervision. The members will be appointed in a process involving the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council. They will be subject to strict conflict of interest rules and their mandate will be limited to 5 years with the possibility of an extension of two years. Article 46a sets out the tasks of the Executive Board, which will mainly be responsible for decisions relating to the direct supervision of financial market participants. The Executive Board will also have a range of decision-making powers, including over individual competent authorities on certain non-regulatory matters, such as dispute settlement, matters relating to a breach of EU law and independent reviews. This will contribute to more effective decision-making that ensures a good balance between national specificities and common EU interests. The Executive Board will take over the responsibilities of the Management Board for preparing ESMA’s work programmes and budget, and the activities of the Management Board will cease. All existing references to the Management Board will be replaced by references to the Executive Board. The members of the Executive Board, including the chairperson, will have one vote each and the chairperson will have a casting vote.  The Board of Supervisors remains ESMA’s main body in charge of overall guidance and decision-making on regulatory matters and supervisory convergence. The proposed amendments to Article 40 change the composition of the Board of Supervisors to include the full-time members of the Executive Board. The Board of Supervisors will be able to object to the main supervisory decisions taken by the Executive Board within 10 days, or 48 hours in urgent cases. The Executive Board can request opinions from the Board of Supervisors on supervisory matters and must report to the Board of Supervisors on its supervisory activities twice a year. In their capacity as voting members of the Board of Supervisors, the members of the Executive Board will bring their expertise to the Board of Supervisors and vote on general supervisory convergence matters.  Article 2 – Amendments to the European Market Infrastructure Regulation  Supervision of significant CCPs  New Articles 22a to 22c are introduced to give ESMA direct supervision over significant CCPs, to specify all the details regarding the processes for a CCP to be determined as a significant CCP by ESMA, to specify the powers attributed to ESMA over significant CCPs and to introduce a provision regarding the supervisory fees charged by ESMA to CCPs it supervises. Article 12 is amended to give ESMA the power to impose penalties. A new Annex V is also introduced to provide a list of infringements for which ESMA can impose fines. Article 2 is amended to adapt the definition of ‘competent authority’ and to introduce new definitions of the terms ‘significant CCP’, ‘CCP’s competent authority’ and ‘national competent authority’. In addition, Article 22 is amended to provide Member States with the option to appoint ESMA as the CCP’s competent authority also for their less significant CCPs. To ensure that these definitions are consistent across related pieces of Regulation and to reflect ESMA’s supervisory authority over significant CCPs, amendments have also been introduced to Regulation (EU) 2021/23.  Articles 14, 17 18, 20 are adapted to abolish colleges for significant CCPs and to adjust the various procedures to account for ESMA’s new role, for example by removing the need for ESMA opinions when significant CCPs are involved and to cater for the abolition of the CCP Supervisory Committee.  In addition, Article 23 is amended to add provisions about ESMA’s collaboration with the ‘relevant authorities for significant CCPs’. This change is accompanied by the introduction of a new definition of the term ‘relevant authorities for significant CCPs’ in Article 2, and a new Article 22d to provide a detailed list of relevant authorities for such CCPs. In addition, Articles, 17c, 20, 23, and 24 are amended to take into account this new term in the related procedures and information flows.  Article 89 is amended to align the transitional provisions for CCPs which were already authorised before the entry into force of this amending Regulation.  Supervision of less significant CCPs  Article 2 is amended to introduce a definition of ‘less significant CCP’. Article 18 is amended to make ESMA the sole chair of colleges for less significant CCPs. In addition, Articles 24a, 24d and 25c are amended and Articles 24e and 90 are deleted to reflect changes to ESMA’s internal governance, notably the introduction of ESMA’s new Executive Board and the removal of the CCP Supervisory Committee.  Open access and interoperability processes  Articles 7, 8 and 54 are amended to give ESMA the right to arbitrate requests for access to a CCP and requests for access to a trading venue and to approve requests for interoperability arrangements.  Article 3 – Amendments to the Markets in Financial Infrastructure Regulation  Trading venues are currently supervised on a national basis. A key pillar of this proposal is to transfer supervisory competences for significant trading venues and Pan-European Market Operators or PEMOs (and trading venues operated by PEMOs) to ESMA. A trading venue will be deemed significant if it is important for the EU economy or if, in addition to being significant in size, it has a significant cross-border dimension. The proposal gives ESMA the necessary powers to carry out its supervisory tasks, although certain market surveillance powers remain at national level and are conferred on the national surveillance authorities.  Given the importance of proximity to the local market ecosystems, national surveillance authorities would retain responsibilities at local level to ensure the market integrity of the significant trading venues or trading venues operated by a PEMO. However, those responsibilities would be limited to supervising orderly trading and monitoring market abuse and would not extend to obligations directly imposed on trading venues.  Harmonisation of the rules applicable to trading venues  Directive 2014/65/EU (the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II) sets out the rules for the authorisation and operation of trading venues. However, the fact that those rules were set out in a Directive has led to EU law being transposed and interpreted differently. It has also resulted in many Member States adopting additional measures in areas not strictly harmonised under the Directive, such as prudential requirements for regulated markets. Creating a truly ‘single rule book’ for trading venues is a precondition for effective supervision at EU level. The proposal therefore inserts a new Title Ia in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 (the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation) to further harmonise the rules for trading venues and remove national rules that hinder the functioning of the single market. A significant number of the measures have been directly transferred from the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II, but the new Title Ia also further specifies the applicable framework in areas that were previously left to national discretion.  In addition, the proposed new Title Ia clarifies the types of cross-border activities that a regulated market may carry out on the basis of its individual licence. It therefore also clarifies that not only should regulated markets be able to provide arrangements to enable access to their venue from other Member States (through ‘trading screens’), as already provided for in the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II, but they should also be able to provide services linked to: (i) the admission to trading of securities on their venue; and (ii) the admission of new members from other Member States. It also clarifies that regulated markets can do this either by setting up a branch or, without a branch, through the freedom to provide services across the EU single market. Multilateral trading facilities and organised trading facilities have the same rights.  Lastly, the proposal aims to make it easier to allocate resources and functions within a group. Title Ia therefore clarifies that allocating resources to an entity within the same group or relying on such an entity to perform certain functions should not be considered outsourcing for the purpose of the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation. It also clarifies that the geographical location of an entity to which resources are allocated or which is relied upon to perform certain functions should not be relevant to the competent authority’s assessment of the compliance of the trading venue with its organisational requirements.  Creation of a ‘Pan-European Market Operator’ status  The proposal creates a new ‘Pan-European Market Operator’ (PEMO) status, which allows for the operation of several trading venues in more than one Member State on the basis of a single licence. If a PEMO takes over existing trading venues, the proposal provides for the individual authorisation(s) under which those venues operated to be deemed void once the new PEMO authorisation is issued. The new Title Ia sets out the authorisation procedure in detail and the requirements applicable to PEMOs. The proposal also clarifies that a PEMO should be responsible for ensuring that the trading venues it operates comply with the requirements applicable to regulated markets, multilateral trading facilities or organised trading facilities, as appropriate. Lastly, for areas of law that are not yet harmonised (e.g. tax law) or not yet fully harmonised (e.g. rules on transparency) under EU law, the proposal clarifies that, for each trading venue, the PEMO should apply the law of the Member State where that trading venue is deemed to be situated or operated, and that the relevant national surveillance authority should be that of the Member State where a venue operated by a PEMO is deemed to be situated or operated. In addition, it is clarified that, where a PEMO takes over the operation of a trading venue that has already been authorised, that trading venue should be deemed to be situated or operated in the Member State where it was initially authorised.  Open access  Under this proposal, the rules under which a trading venue has access to the services of a CCP (Article 35 of the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation) and under which a CCP has access to the trade feeds of a trading venue (Article 36 of the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation) would be streamlined to ensure that such access is not unjustifiably delayed and that access is refused only where there are significant systemic risks or risks to the orderly functioning of the markets. Furthermore, the market practice known as ‘preferred clearing’ would be prohibited where two parties choose to clear at different CCPs that have already been granted access to a given trading venue and have already put in place interoperability arrangements.  Enhancement of the consolidated tape  Under the current Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation, the consolidated tape for shares and exchange-traded funds does not provide information on the identity of the trading venue offering the best bid and offer price or on the depth of the trading book. Given the importance of this information to users of the consolidated tape, the proposal adds it to the tape. The proposal also enhances transparency on quotes by systematic internalisers for orders originating from retail clients.  Article 4 – Amendments to the Central Securities Depository Regulation  Modernisation of the regulatory framework for CSD services  Article 2 of the Central Securities Depositories Regulation is amended in order to allow for the provision of CSD services using DLT. Specifically, the existing definitions of ‘book-entry’, ‘cash’ and ‘securities accounts’ are amended and definitions of ‘distributed ledger technology’ and ‘e-money token’ are added. Similarly, Article 30 related to outsourcing is amended to cover the provision of CSD services using DLT and a new article (Article 45a) is introduced on risks related to the use of DLT outside of an outsourcing arrangement. Finally, the framework set out in Title IV for the settlement of the cash leg of a securities transaction is amended to allow settlement, under specific conditions, with certain e-money tokens authorised under the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation.  Supervision of significant CSDs  Article 11 of the CSDR is amended to give ESMA direct supervisory authority over significant CSDs and a new Article 11a is added to set out the conditions and procedures for determining which EU CSDs are ‘significant’. As ESMA will become the direct supervisor of significant CSDs, Article 2 is amended to adjust the definition of ‘competent authority’, and a new definition of ‘national competent authority’ is added. Article 10 is amended to reflect ESMA’s new role as supervisor. Title V on sanctions is also amended to reflect ESMA’s new role, and a new Annex II lists the of infringements for which ESMA can impose sanctions.  Article 24a is amended to abolish colleges for significant CSDs and Articles 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 21a, 22b, 27b, 60 and 62 are amended to adjust the various procedures to account for ESMA’s new role. This includes, for example, removing the need for an opinion from ESMA where significant CSDs are involved. Article 10 also provides further details of ESMA’s oversight and supervisory powers over significant CSDs.  Given ESMA’s new powers over significant CSDs, a new Article 25a sets out the framework for the supervisory fees that can be charged by ESMA.  Integration of CSD services  Article 14 is amended to provide more detailed provisions on the cooperation between ESMA, relevant authorities, and national competent authorities.  Article 2 is amended to introduce a definition of the term ‘CSD hub’, and a new Article 48a sets out the procedure for ESMA to determine which EU CSDs are considered CSD hubs. To facilitate access to all financial instruments issued in EU CSDs, Article 48a introduces a requirement for CSD hubs to establish reciprocal links with other CSD hubs, and for CSDs that are not hubs to establish reciprocal links with a CSD hub.  To further integrate EU CSDs, Article 40 is amended to require EU CSDs that settle the cash leg of their transactions in a currency available on an EU integrated platform to directly connect to that platform and enable their participants to settle the cash leg in accounts opened on that platform.  Article 54 is amended to relax the requirements that apply when a CSD wishes to designate a credit institution to provide banking-type ancillary services, specifically when the cash leg is settled in non-EU currencies.  Article 19a is added to introduce a simplified process for outsourcing core services within a group of CSDs.  Improving the CSD passporting regime  With the aim of lifting the remaining barriers to the passporting of CSD services in the EU, Article 23 is amended to require only an ex-post notification when an EU CSD starts offering its services to issuers established in another Member State than the Member State of authorisation of the CSD.  Article 6 – Amendments to the Cross-Border Distribution Regulation  The proposeed changes to Regulation (EU) 2019/1156 (the Cross-Border Distribution Regulation) are aimed at removing barriers to the cross-border operations of investment funds and strengthen ESMA’s powers to foster a common supervisory culture and better coordinate activities across home and host national competent authorities.  Harmonisation of marketing communications  Article 4 of the Cross-Border Distribution Regulation is amended to clarify that AIFMs, EuVECA and EuSEF managers and UCITS management companies should ensure that the requirements on marketing communications are met even when the marketing function is delegated to a third party. However, where the marketing is performed by third-party distributors acting on their own behalf so that the AIFMs and UCITS management companies are no longer in control of the marketing function, the AIFMs and UCITS management companies are not subject to the requirements on marketing communications. It is further specified that host Member States cannot impose any additional requirements on marketing communications than the ones laid down in Article 4. Moreover, the Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts to specify the format and content of marketing communications.  Articles 5, 6, 8, 11 and 13 of the Cross-Border Distribution Regulation are deleted to reduce diverging national practices on marketing communications and the payment of regulatory fees and charges.  Article 7 of the Cross-Border Distribution Regulation is replaced by a new Article 7 specifying that the competent authorities of host Member States shall not require prior notification of marketing communications, but where they believe that marketing communications do not comply with the requirements of Article 4 , they may ask the competent authorities of the home Member State of the AIFM, EuVECA or EuSEF manager or UCITS to take all appropriate measures to prevent or penalise further irregularities. The competent authorities of host Member States may further refer the matter to ESMA if they are not satisfied with the actions taken by the home competent authorities.  Increase transparency on fees and charges levied by host Member States  Article 9 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1156 is amended to mandate ESMA to publish and maintain up-to-date information on the regulatory fees and changes imposed by host competent authorities to AIFMs, EuVECA managers, EuSEF managers and UCITS marketing AIFs or UCITS in their territories, including the level and frequency of those fees and the modalities of their payment.  Improve the passporting regime for UCITS and AIFs  Article 12 of the Cross-Border Distribution Regulation is deleted and is replaced by a new power for ESMA to develop a data platform that would include information on AIFs and UCITS marketed on a cross-border basis, the documentation provided as part of their marketing notification and any changes thereof, and the de-notifications of marketing arrangements.  The former Chapter XI of Directive 2009/65/EC and Articles 30a, 31, 32 and 32a of Directive 2011/61/EU governing the marketing of UCITS and EU AIFs managed by EU AIFMs across the Union are imported into Regulation (EU) 2019/1156 and amended to optimise marketing notification and de-notification procedures and facilitate the cross-border marketing of AIFs and UCITS. In particular, Regulation (EU) 2019/1156 is complemented to allow UCITS and AIFMs to market funds in a Member State other than their home Member State, by indicating such intention in their application for authorisation and transmitting as part of their authorisation documentation linked to the marketing of UCITS or AIFs in other Member States (eg. marketing communications, the key investor information document, the prospectus, the annual report). Upon authorisation, the competent authorities of the home Member State of the UCITS or AIFM shall transmit that information to the ESMA data platform and the UCITS or AIFM can access the markets of the Member States indicated in their application for authorisation as of the date of that transmission. Regulation (EU) 2019/1156 is further complemented to introduce specific procedures when there are changes to the scope of the initial marketing notification, including changes to the Member States in which the units or shares of UCITS or AIFs are to be marketed.  The former Articles 32a of Directive 2011/61/EU and 93a of Directive 2009/65/EC are imported to Regulation (EU) 2019/1156 and are amended to simplify the de-notification of arrangements made for the marketing of units or shares of UCITS or AIFs. The existing 36-month prohibition of pre-marketing of units or shares of EU AIFs with similar investment strategies in the Member State identified in the de-notification is removed.  Supervision of UCITS and AIFs marketed across the EU  The Cross-Border Distribution Regulation is complemented to specify the powers of the host competent authorities of the AIFM and UCITS vis-a-vis the AIFs and UCITS marketed in their territories. Regulation (EU) 2019/1156 is further supplemented to empower ESMA to identify and pursue actions to address diverging, duplicative, redundant and deficient supervisory actions hindering the cross-border marketing of EU AIFs managed by an EU AIFM and of UCITS across the Union. In addition, the Cross-Border Distribution Regulation is amended to grant ESMA the power to intervene when national authorities do not effectively apply Union rules, or to directly suspend the cross-border marketing of AIFs and UCITS in certain cases.  Finally, the Cross-Border Distribution Regulation is supplemented to clarify that competent authorities should be able to refer to ESMA any disagreements on assessments, actions, or omissions, which ESMA should settle in accordance with the powers conferred to it under Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.  Article 8 – Amendments to EU DLT Pilot Regime Regulation  This proposal also amends the DLT Pilot regime (Regulation (EU) 2022/858) to increase the regime’s flexibility and proportionality, as well as its scale and scope and to address concerns around the durability of the regime by removing the time limits of the permissions granted under the pilot.  Expanding and making more flexible the scope of eligible instruments and scale of activities  Article 2 is amended to introduce new concepts. Among others, the trading infrastructure in the Pilot is now referred to as a DLT trading venue (DLT TV) to reflect that it would be possible to operate both a multilateral trading system and an organised trading facility under the Pilot. Article 3 is amended to make more flexible current limits of the pilot regime, both on the type of financial instruments that are eligible as well as on the scale of activity that can be carried out in these instruments. For the scale of activities, the proposal would maintain a total maximal aggregated market value of all the DLT financial instruments that can be admitted to trading or recorded on a DLT market infrastructure but raise it to EUR 100 billion. Finally, product-specific threshold would be removed.  Creating a simplified regime for smaller DLT market infrastructures  Article 3 is further amended and a new Article 7a is added to introduce a simplified regime for operators of smaller DLT infrastructures providing CSD services as long as they remain under threshold of no more than EUR 10 billion of total market value of recorded DLT financial instruments. The simplified regime would feature rules that are adapted to the scale of activities undertaken by smaller operators. Depending on the activities they plan to undertake, applicants to the simplified regime would be required to hold an underlying authorisation to be eligible, such as a CASP, a CSD or an investment firm licence. The entities operating under the simplified regime would be subject to a specified subset of provisions of Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 that result in a more proportionate and principles-based approach to the regulation of small-scale provision of CSD services.  Expanding scope of eligible entities  Article 4 is amended to expand the scope of entities which can operate a DLT TV and a DLT trading and settlement system (DLT TSS) to include, in addition to investment firms and CSDs, also crypto-assets services providers (CASPs) that are authorised to operate a crypto-asset trading platform. CASPs permitted to operate a DLT market infrastructure, would become subject to requirements set out in EU trading and post-trading rules (Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, Directive 2014/65/EU and Regulation (EU) No 909/2014) while benefiting from targeted and justifiable exemptions like other operators of DLT market infrastructures.  Additional exemptions regarding applicants operating a DLT TV and a DLT settlement systems (DLT SS)  New Articles 4a and 5a are introduced to offer operators of DLT market infrastructures the possibility to obtain, under certain strict conditions, exemptions from a wide range of provisions of Directive 2014/65/EU, Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 and Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 where these have been found to be incompatible or highly disproportionate with the use of DLT. Before granting exemptions from specific provisions, competent authorities must seek a non-binding opinion from ESMA.  Specific rules for operators of a DLT SS settling payments using commercial bank money and e-money tokens  Article 5 is amended to enable operators of a DLT SS to designate credit institutions for the settlement of payments in commercial bank money that satisfy the prudential and capital requirements of Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 but that will be able to engage in other activities beyond providing banking-type ancillary services of the purpose of settlement. As regards settlement of payments in e-money tokens, it is clarified that most banking ancillary services involving e-money tokens should be provided by the same type of credit institutions as those that can settle payments in commercial bank money.  Provision of individual CSD services, settlement schemes and interoperability between DLT market infrastructures  New Articles 10a to 10f are introduced to, firstly, allow for service-specific regulation of two CSD core services, the notary and central maintenance service, and, secondly, to introduce a new model for settlement that relies on of DLT account keepers with access to central bank money. These articles also ensure comprehensive supervision of these new ways to provide CSD core services. Both the DLT notary and the DLT central maintenance services can be provided by an investment firm, a regulated market, a credit institution, a CSD, or a CASP that obtain a specific permission to provide that service, upon demonstrating compliance with applicable provisions of Regulation (EU) No 909/2014. Consequently, it will be possible to issue and record DLT financial instruments outside a CSD, however, these instruments will be required to be settled with a regulated market infrastructure. Furthermore, the settlement of DLT financial instruments will be possible between DLT account keepers having access to central bank money accounts. These DLT account keepers will have to be a part of a settlement scheme, which is a set of rules and procedures agreed between participants for settling DLT financial instruments, and which has to be previously assessed and authorised by ESMA. The settlement scheme and participating DLT account keepers will have to comply with a number of requirements ensuring robust settlement outcomes and report regularly to ESMA.  Finally, new Article 10g requires entities active in the post-trading value chain in the Pilot, and beyond, to establish technical standards that support interoperability between DLT market infrastructures, with an obligation to report on their work on ESMA. Taking into account the efforts of the industry, ESMA is required to provide the Commission with technical advice on supporting interoperability between DLT market infrastructures.  Article 9 – Amendments to the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation  Transfer of supervision of crypto-asset service providers  The amendments to the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (EU) 2023/1114 (MiCA) seek to transfer the authorization, monitoring and supervision of all crypto-asset service providers (“CASPs”) from national competent authorities to ESMA. In this respect, the definitions in Article 3 and the provisions of Titles V and VI (Articles 59-92) of the MiCA Regulation are amended to render ESMA responsible for the authorisation, monitoring and supervision of crypto-asset service providers, including the provisions that relate to market abuse for the crypto-asset sector.  Treatment of certain financial entities providing crypto-asset services  Certain firms subject to Union legislative acts on financial services are already allowed to provide all or some crypto-asset services without being required to obtain an authorization as a crypto-asset service provider under MiCA. These entities will continue to be supervised for their crypto-asset activities by the competent authorities that granted them authorization under other Union acts. However, whe re the provision of crypto-asset services becomes the main activity of those entities, they will be treated as crypto-asset service providers and the supervision for all their activities will be transferred to ESMA. To fulfil this duty, it is provided that ESMA should establish cooperation agreements with the competent authorities that authorised those entities under other Union legislative acts on financial services. On the basis of the cooperation agreement, those competent authorities shall provide support and assistance to ESMA in the supervision of the activities that are not covered by Regulation (EU) 2023/1114. As there is already a centralized system of banking supervision, ensuring integration and consistency in supervision, there should be no transfer of supervisory powers where the entity providing crypto-asset services is a credit institution.  Supervisory powers of ESMA  In order to fulfil its supervisory duties under MiCA, including investigation of infringements of the rules on market abuse, the amendment introduces a new section on supervisory powers and competences of ESMA in Title VII (Articles 138a – 138j). This is accompanied by a new Annex VII, listing the possible infringements of provisions in Titles V and VI for crypto-asset service providers and other persons. ESMA will rely on the new supervisory powers introduced in Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 and the sector specific powers introduced in the new Chapter 6 of Title VII. Such powers include the power to carry out on-site inspections, take supervisory measures and impose fines. ESMA is empowered to take a range of supervisory measures, including, but not limited to, requiring the crypto-asset service provider to bring the infringement to an end, suspend the provision of crypto-asset services, and withdrawing the authorisation under certain conditions.  Cooperation with other authorities and assistance in carrying out tasks  ESMA is empowered to exchange information with competent authorities in Member States and third countries in order to carry out its supervisory responsibilities effectively, as well as cooperate with other relevant authorities and the European Banking Authority (Articles 138c -138f).  Transitional provisions  To avoid disruption to existing crypto-asset service providers, the amendment introduces transitional provisions (Article 143a) to ensure the smooth transition of supervision from national competent authorities to ESMA and a smooth transmission of files and working documents from national competent authorities to ESMA. A transitional period is also provided for applicants whose application for a CASP authorisation is currently being assessed by national competent authorities but has not been concluded.  Article 5 and Articles 10 to 14 - Amendments to Securities Financing Transactions Regulation, C redit rating agencies Regulation, Benchmarks Regulation, Securitisation Regulation , European Green Bonds Regulation and ESG Ratings Regulation  The amendments introduced in Articles 5 and 10 to 14 streamline the supervisory and enforcement framework applicable to trade repositories, credit rating agencies, benchmark administrators, securitisation repositories, external reviewers for European Green Bonds and ESG ratings providers by aligning their procedural regimes with the new horizontal supervisory framework established under the ESMA Regulation. A large number of sector-specific procedural provisions—particularly those governing investigatory powers, fines, periodic penalty payments, and related decision-making processes—are deleted and replaced with references to the consolidated toolbox in Articles 39a to 39m of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010. This shift removes duplicative and sometimes inconsistent procedural rules embedded in individual sectoral acts and replaces them with a single, coherent and predictable set of supervisory procedures. At the same time, the acts are updated to ensure that ESMA retains all powers necessary to supervise the relevant entities, including the power to suspend the use of credit ratings, impose fines, or exercise oversight over external reviewers, while fee-setting provisions are harmonised through a cross-cutting regime based on turnover. Collectively, these amendments reduce fragmentation, improve legal clarity and operational efficiency, and ensure that cross-sector supervision is exercised under a unified procedural framework, while preserving sector-specific rules where these remain essential.  2025/0383 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulations (EU) No 1095/2010, No 648/2012, No 600/2014, No 909/2014, 2015/2365, 2019/1156, 2021/23, 2022/858, 2023/1114, No 1060/2009, 2016/1011, 2017/2402, 2023/2631 and 2024/3005 as regards the further development of capital market integration and supervision within the Union  (Text with EEA relevance)  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 14 ,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Data Protection Supervisor,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) The S avings and Investments Union (SIU) strategy is part of the Commission strategy to provide a vision of the Union as an economic powerhouse . For that purpose, it is necessary to establish a single market for financial services by addressing market inefficiencies resulting from fragmentation and to create the truly integrated European capital markets which are accessible to all citizens and businesses across the Union . It is also important that financial markets potential of the Union is unlocked by providing access to more efficient capital-market based financing and by facilitating cross-border capital flows, which in turn should support the economy of the Union, stimulate job creation and enhance competitiveness.  (2) It is necessary to foster a seamless capital market across the EU by strengthening the supervisory framework and addressing regulatory fragmentation, thereby ensuring better integration of capital markets throughout the Union. In particular, w hile the integration of capital markets in the Union should ultimately be a market-driven process, certain barriers stemming notably from the Union legislative framework can obstruct progress. The Union should therefore focus on removing barriers in the sectors of trading, post-trading and asset management, and barriers hindering the uptake of new technologies . As market integration deepened, it is also crucial for the Union supervisory framework to evolve in accordance with it.  (3) In the context of the political objective of simplifying financial services legislation and delivering more effective and efficient implementation of Union policies, the Commission, after having consulted the European Supervisory Authorities, AMLA, the Council and the European Parliament, sent a letter on 1 October 2025 deprioritising empowerments non-essential for the effective functioning of the Level 1 legislations . For those deprioritised empowerments where the Commission would be legally required to act (‘shall + a date’) legal clarity for stakeholders would be enhanced when the basic act is also amended.  (4) The development of a deeper and more integrated Union capital market, as envisaged in the Savings and Investments Union Communication, requires consistent and effective supervision across Member States. Divergent national supervisory practices create legal uncertainty, increase the cost of cross-border activity and fragment the single market for financial services, thereby hindering market integration and the efficient allocation of capital. To address those challenges, it is necessary to strengthen supervisory convergence and, where appropriate, entrust the European Securities and Markets Authority (‘ESMA’) with additional tasks and powers to ensure the uniform application of Union law and the effective oversight of entities with significant cross-border relevance.  (5) For that purpose, ESMA should be given additional competences and its governance and funding framework should be reinforced to promote transparent, accountable and efficient decision-making at Union level and to ensure that ESMA has sufficient resources to fulfil its expanded responsibilities. The transfer of direct supervisory powers to ESMA in relation to significant entities in the field of market infrastructure and to crypto-asset service providers (CASPs), together with enhanced supervisory convergence tools, should contribute to a more integrated, competitive and resilient capital market that delivers better outcomes for investors, firms and the broader economy.  (6) Pursuant to Article 1(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 15 ) , ESMA is to act within the powers conferred on it by a range of Union legislative acts, including several Directives and Regulations listed therein. To ensure the full application of Union financial legislation, ESMA should apply national legislation transposing directives in a manner consistent with Union Law in a way that respects the primacy of Union Law,  (7) In addition , Article 1(2) of that Regulation further provides that ESMA is to act within the powers conferred by any other legally binding Union act which assigns tasks to ESMA . It is necessary to ensure that the scope of ESMA’s responsibilities and tasks automatically extends to any subsequent Union legislation conferring powers or functions on ESMA .  (8) To reflect the progressive extension of ESMA ’s direct supervisory, investigatory, enforcement and other responsibilities across different sectors of the financial system, it is necessary to introduce a definition of financial market participant s that are under ESMA’s supervision. That definition should encompass all financial market participants for which ESMA has been conferred powers. That definition should ensure consistency and clarity in the application of ESMA ’s supervisory powers, irrespective of the legal instrument from which those powers derive, and facilitate the establishment of common procedural and organisational arrangements for supervision and enforcement.  (9) To ensure the effective exercise of its direct supervisory responsibilities, ESMA should establish structured yet flexible cooperation arrangements with other authorities. Such cooperation should capture a range of situations, corresponding to the evolving role of ESMA. Such arrangements should cater, first, for cases where national competent authorities are still responsible for certain entities or activities but will cease to be in charge of supervision of certain entities following the assumption of direct supervisory powers by ESMA, thereby requiring transitional solutions to ensure continuity and an orderly transfer of responsibilities. Second, those cooperation arrangements should cover cases where, alongside ESMA ’s direct supervisory powers , other Union or national authorities, although not acting or having acted as competent authorities, hold relevant expertise or consultation rights under Union law, such as the European Central Bank in relation to central counterparties. Third, those cooperation arrangements should cover cases where tasks are not transferred to ESMA, such as market surveillance for trading venues. To address these different situations and, in particular, to ensure a smooth transition, the Authority should have the flexibility to set up cooperation arrangements adapted to the sector concerned, the nature of the tasks and the degree of involvement required. Such arrangements may range from close structural cooperation, including the establishment of joint supervisory teams or the conduct of joint inspections, to looser forms of operational coordination and, progressively, to more autonomous supervisory action by the Authority as its capacity develops. Those cooperation arrangements should also allow for their gradual adjustments over time and, where appropriate, the establishment of local presences of the Authority in Member States. Those cooperation arrangements should also promote effective and resource-efficient supervision, ensure the continuity and consistency of supervisory outcomes, and take due account of the statutory responsibilities and resources of other authorities. Cooperation should be guided by the principles of efficiency, proportionality, mutual trust and good faith, and should promote the effective use of resources while safeguarding ESMA’s independence and accountability for the performance of its tasks. To reflect the progressive build-up of ESMA’s supervisory capacity and to ensure the full and effective assumption of its supervisory tasks, the cooperation arrangements should be subject to regular review by ESMA.  (10) In certain circumstances, temporary exemptions or other transitional arrangements under Union financial services legislation may expire before the entry into force or full implementation of new or amended provisions introducing a permanent exemption, replacement framework, or new regulatory treatment. In addition, significant market developments may occur that render compliance with specific requirements under existing Union law temporarily disproportionate, operationally impracticable, or unduly burdensome in light of prevailing market conditions and the underlying regulatory objectives. To ensure legal certainty and regulatory continuity, and to avoid unnecessary market disruption, it is appropriate to provide that the no-action letter as set out in Article 9a of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 may also apply in cases where (i) a regulatory gap arises during the phasing-in of new requirements, or (ii) exceptional market conditions lead to disproportionate compliance burdens for market participants.  (11) To support cooperation between authorities and facilitate the new collaboration platforms, the Authority should develop a corresponding technological platform to facilitate the collection, storage, access to and processing of data and information. Th at data platform should contribute to high-quality data governance consistent with FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and also include the supervisory technology and other tools to enhance analysis and monitoring capabilities of the relevant authorities.  (12) In its capacity as processor of personal data, the Agency should implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the security, availability, maintenance and development of the software and IT infrastructure of the platform and that processing of personal data in the context of facilitating the access to and exchange of information on the platform in in line with Union law laying down the obligations to collect and exchange those data and in line with data protection laws. Where the Agency has the obligation to processes personal data pursuant other Union acts, the Agency should fulfil its obligations as controllers in regard to that information.  (13) In view of ESMA’s powers and competence over a broad category of entities and to ensure the effective, consistent exercise of its supervisory powers across sectors, it is appropriate to rationalise and consolidate in Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 the procedural framework for the exercise of supervisory tools necessary for the Authority to carry out its tasks. Those powers, which are currently dispersed across various sectoral Union acts should be replaced, to the extent possible, by a single horizontal framework applicable to all entities under the Authority’s direct supervision. That horizontal framework should provide a coherent set of procedural rules governing ESMA’s requests for information, investigations and on-site inspections, as well as the adoption of supervisory measures, fines and periodic penalty payments. S uch requests for and access to information, including during investigations and on-site inspections, may encompass personal data insofar as it is relevant and necessary for the performance of the Authority’s tasks, and any processing of such data sh ould comply with the applicable Union rules on the protection of personal data, in particular the principles of necessity, proportionality and purpose limitation. Moreover, that horizontal framework should ensure full respect for the rights of defence and for legal professional privilege, and provide for appropriate judicial protection, including the review of ESMA’s decisions by the Court of Justice of the European Union. By setting such a procedural framework in a coherent and uniform manner and abolishing sector-specific procedural provisions, the Union should enhance legal certainty, promote supervisory convergence and efficiency, and support the effective and accountable exercise of ESMA’s direct supervisory responsibilities. To avoid regulatory overlap or inconsistency , to ensure that the Authority exercises its powers in a n e ffective manner , to preserve the coherence of the Union acquis and respect the principle whereby specific rules take precedence over general rules, w here sectoral legislation contains specific provisions tailored to the procedural powers of the Authority in particular sectors or areas, those provisions should continue to apply  and , where appropriate, prevail over the general powers laid down in th at Regulation .  (14) Effective supervision and cooperation among competent authorities in the context of cross-border provision of financial services is essential to protect investors and foster trust and confidence in the financial system within the Union. For that purpose, ESMA should be equipped with enhanced supervisory convergence tools, including mechanisms to address supervisory failures and tools to facilitate cooperation and resolve disputes between competent authorities to ensure that financial market participants are subject to high-quality supervision.  (15) To address proven supervisory failures in the approval of financial products, services or entities operating across the Union, it is necessary to enable ESMA to require a competent authority to seek its opinion before granting approval where a peer review or an investigation reveals failures in supervision which could jeopardize the integrity of financial markets, financial stability, or investor protection. The peer review or investigation process, as set out in Article 22(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010, provides a robust and transparent framework for identifying supervisory failures and for taking corrective action. ESMA’s opinion should provide an additional layer of scrutiny and oversight, ensuring that financial products and services, and entities operating in the Union meet the highest standards of supervision. To prevent products , services or entities from entering the EU market without adequate supervision , it is necessary to enable ESMA to require in its opinion that competent authorities take corrective actions to address any shortcomings in supervision identified by ESMA.  (16) To facilitate regular and structured information exchange, propose solutions, and enhance cooperation to address common challenges and risks, and to support the overall goal of consistent and effective supervision, it is necessary to provide for collaboration platforms between competent authorities. Such platforms should be flexible, enabling ESMA to initiate or respond to requests from competent authorities, and should not prejudice the existing supervisory mandates and responsibilities of those competent authorities. Those collaboration platforms should also promote transparency, accountability, and a culture of compliance among financial market participants, with ESMA exercising its powers to resolve disputes and ensure compliance with Union law.  (17) Due to the lack of a mechanism for mutual recognition of administrative decisions, national competent authorities have significant difficulties in enforcing recovery of administrative fines in a cross-border context. To ensure effective enforcement of rules and the proper functioning of the single market in the area of financial services, it is necessary to introduce a mechanism for mutual recognition of decisions imposing an administrative fine and for assistance in executing requests to recover such a fine and such mechanism should be based on the principle of mutual trust. To that end, the grounds for a refusal to execute the request to recover an administrative fine should be limited to the minimum necessary.  (18) To ensure a consistent and transparent approach to the financing of ESMA’s supervisory activities, it is necessary to harmonise and consolidate the principles governing the levying of fees on entities under ESMA’s competence, which are currently set out separately in sectoral legislation conferring direct supervisory powers on ESMA. Establishing common principles on the scope, calculation, and transparency of such fees should promote a level playing field among entities across sectors, ensure the proportional application of supervisory costs, and provide legal certainty for both existing and new entities falling under ESMA’s competence. Those fees should cover all costs incurred by ESMA in the performance of its supervisory tasks, including, but not limited to, the costs of supervisory convergence work in the relevant sector, the development, operation and maintenance of IT tools and systems necessary for direct supervision, as well as the depreciated cost of such systems and related infrastructure. ESMA should be appropriately financed. It is therefore necessary to lay down that ESMA should be financed 50 % from Union funds and 50 % through contributions from Member States, made in accordance with the weighting of votes set out in Article 3(3) of the Protocol (No 36) on transitional provisions for the new tasks envisaged for ESMA by this Regulation that are not fee funded .  (19) In light of the future new competences of ESMA, its governance structure should be adapted accordingly. To ensure the effective and impartial functioning of ESMA it is necessary to strengthen its governance by introducing an independent Executive Board with full-time members, which should enhance its capacity to take swift and Union-oriented decisions, in particular for the supervision of financial market participants. The Executive Board, composed of the Chairperson and five independent full-time members with diverse supervisory experiences and expertise in the sectors under ESMA’s supervision, should be responsible for decisions addressed to financial market participants in supervisory matters. The Executive Board should also be responsible for decisions addressed to one or a limited number of competent authorities, including dispute settlements, breaches of Union law, and peer reviews.  These decisions are attributed to the Executive Board to increase the agility and reactivity of the decision-making and to ensure that the decisions take into account a common European interest. The Executive Board should also assume the competence of the current Management Board in preparing ESMA’s work programmes and budget. This should ensure effective, impartial and EU-oriented decisions. To ensure transparency and democratic control, the full-time members of the Executive Board should be appointed by the Council, based on a shortlist drawn up by the Commission and a proposal by the Board of Supervisors, following approval by the European Parliament.  (20) To ensure a clear division of responsibilities and effective checks and balances, the Board of Supervisors should remain ESMA’s main body for regulatory decisions and supervisory convergence. To enhance the Union dimension in the decision-making process within the Board of Supervisors its composition should be adjusted to include the full-time members of the Executive Board as voting members for supervisory decisions. To ensure a balanced approach and the consideration of national perspectives the Board of Supervisors should have the power to object to major supervisory decisions taken by the Executive Board within 10 days (or 48 hours in urgent cases), while the Executive Board should be required to report to the Board of Supervisors twice a year on its supervisory activities and should be able to request opinions on supervisory matters.  (21) It is necessary to streamline and align the review clause of the Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 with existing evaluation requirements for the agencies, as set out in the Joint Statement and Common Approach on EU decentralised agencies from July 2012, which provide for periodic evaluations every five years instead of three years. The targeted reviews provided for in that Regulation, starting five years after the date of entry into force, replace evaluations and enable the Commission to assess the relevant aspects of ESMA's performance after an adequate period of time has elapsed. This approach is consistent with the objective of reducing regulatory burdens and promoting a more targeted and effective regulatory framework, allowing for informed decisions on potential simplifications and improvements.  (22) Central counterparties (‘ CCPs ’) within the Union are currently authorised and supervised by the competent authorities of the Member States in which they are established, in cooperation with ESMA and CCP colleges. Despite progress achieved so far in harmonising supervisory activity for CCPs in the Union, diverging supervisory practices for CCPs amongst those national authorities across the Union persist, creating an unlevel playing field among CCPs within the Union. This increases the complexity of the Union CCP framework and places an additional burden and additional costs on CCPs within the Union, including when compared with Tier 2 CCPs directly supervised by ESMA. With the development of deeper, more liquid Union capital markets under the Savings and Investments Union, that unlevel playing field could increase the risk of, and incentives for, supervisory arbitrage which could in turn lead to financial stability issues. Therefore,  to ensure that the prudential, organisational and business conduct requirements for CCPs within the Union are applied in a uniform manner, in particular for CCPs with substantial clearing activity, CCPs with a material cross-border dimension, and CCPs that are part of a group that includes other market infrastructures that are supervised by ESMA, should be supervised by ESMA, based on its expertise and experience in the application of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council 16 . CCPs with low clearing activity and a more domestic standing, deemed less significant, should continue to benefit from the supervision of local authorities with a greater familiarity with domestic markets. 17  (23) To determine which CCPs authorised under Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 should be deemed significant and thus subject to supervision by ESMA, it is necessary to provide clear and objective criteria, which should reflect the activities and risks of the CCPs concerned. With the aim of simplification and of avoiding unnecessary administrative burden, an existing CCP determined as significant at a later stage, should not be re-authorised.  (24) National competent authorities supervising l ess significant CCPs should have stronger cooperation with ESMA to ensure a consistent approach to supervision and hence ensure a level playing field for CCPs . In case they wish to do so, Member States should have the option to designate ESMA as the competent authority for less significant CCPs established in their jurisdictions. Moreover, should a previously significant CCP no longer meet the conditions to be considered as such, a sufficient transition period should be granted to the national competent authority to allow it to prepare before formally taking over supervisory responsibilities for that CCP. Alternatively, the national competent authority should be able to leave the supervision of this previously significant CCP to ESMA. In addition, to ensure consistency and a level playing field between significant and less significant CCPs, ESMA should also be the authority responsible for authorising interoperability arrangements and for chairing the colleges for less significant CCPs. T he new supervisory arrangements for CCPs in the Union, in particular the role of ESMA as competent authority for significant CCPs , should be reflected in Regulation (EU) 2021/23 of the European Parliament and of the Council 18 .  (25) ESMA should closely cooperate with , and draw on the experience of , the bodies responsible for the oversight of CCPs authorised in the Union and with authorities experienced in the supervision of CCPs to benefit from the knowledge of those bodies . For that purpose, ESMA should develop comprehensive cooperation arrangements with those bodies and authorities, including the national competent authority in the Member State in which the CCP concerned is established, the European Central Bank, other central banks of issue of the most relevant Union currencies that the CCP processes, the competent authorities responsible for the supervision of the trading venues and the central securities depositories served by the CCP , and the competent authority responsible for the supervision of the most active clearing members . Those arrangements should set out the specific modalities and operational arrangements both in ongoing supervision and in exceptional circumstances, such as emergency situations .  (26) T he new supervisory responsibilities granted to ESMA and the changes to ESMA’s internal organisational structure, including the removal of the CCP Supervisory Committee, whose tasks should be assigned to the newly established Executive Board, should be reflected in Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 . Due to the unique status of third-country CCPs, the provisions concerning the procedures applying to them should remain in Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 rather than shifting those provisions to Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010. Furthermore, taking into account those changes, to further simplify the future organisational structure and working arrangements, and to remove unnecessary burden, significant CCPs should not be required to have a college . Similarly, given ESMA’s new supervisory responsibilities for significant CCPs, the requirements for ESMA opinions in relation to those CCPs should be removed . Supervisory arrangements for less significant CCPs should largely remain as they were as those CCPs have a more domestic scope and should benefit from the local knowledge and expertise of national authorities .  (27) Regulation (EU) 2024/791 of the European Parliament and of the Council 19 amended Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council 20 to remove obstacles to the emergence of consolidated tapes in bonds, shares and exchange-traded funds ('ETFs') and OTC derivatives. For a given share or ETF at any given timestamp, the provider of the consolidated tape is required to disseminate the European best bid and offer price (‘EBBO’) and the volume available at those prices across the Union. However, the consolidated tape would not disclose the identity of the trading venue of the EBBO, as it would not attribute the volumes that are available at the EBBO to individual trading venues, nor would it include bid and offer data beyond the EBBO and accompanying volumes. That significantly limits the value added of the consolidated tape, depriving its users of the ability to locate the volumes available at the EBBO and of a representative view of the depth of liquidity that is available for trading. Therefore, to further enhance its attractiveness, the consolidated tape for shares and ETFs should offer a more in-depth view of trading interests, covering the five best buying and selling prices, with the volumes available at those prices, and the indication of the individual trading venue on which those volumes are available.  (28) The closing price of the trading day is essential for equity markets as it provides a key reference price, typically used for the valuation of funds, ETFs and benchmarks. Most times, the closing price is derived from the closing auction that takes place on the trading venue where the securities were first admitted to trading (the ‘primary exchange’). The proportion of equity volumes traded at the closing auction has increased significantly over time. However, competition in the closing auction segment remains limited, with primary exchange closing auctions still capturing the largest share of closing auction trading. In addition, that situation raises resilience concerns, as incidents, including outages, on the primary exchanges may have a direct impact on the capacity of market participants to value their assets. To foster competition in the closing price segment and to ensure that market participants can rely on a closing price that is alternative to the closing auction price produced by the primary exchange, it is necessary to require the provider of the consolidated tape for shares and ETFs to disseminate a volume-weighted closing price resulting from all closing auctions operated by trading venues that are data contributors. ESMA should issue recommendations to specify the methodology that the consolidated tape should apply to determine the volume-weighted closing price.  (29) Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council 21 contains harmonised rules on the authorisation and operation of trading venues. However, the transposition of that Directive led to diverging national requirements. In addition, Member States complemented the transposed provisions with national requirements in instances where the Directive did not set out any requirements. That approach has resulted in an unlevel playing field, the fragmentation of the single market, and increased burden and costs for operators of trading venues located in several Member States and, eventually, the issuers and end-investors they serve. A more uniform framework is therefore necessary to level the playing field, avoid potential regulatory arbitrage, and support the development of activities across borders. It is therefore necessary to transfer requirements on the authorisation and operation of regulated markets and on the operation by an investment firm or a market operator of a multilateral trading facility (‘MTF’) or an organised trading facility (‘OTF’) from Directive 2014/65/EU to Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 and to further complement those provisions, notably to introduce harmonised rules in the areas that were previously subject to national legislation.  (30) The organisational requirements laid down in Article 19(3) and in Article 47 of Directive 2014/65/EU do not take into account whether a market operator or an investment firm operating a trading venue is part of a group. In particular, any intra-group arrangement for resource or function allocation between group entities is treated in the same way as an outsourcing arrangement entered into with entities outside the group. That approach fails to acknowledge the emergence of cross-border groups of trading venues and, as a result, limits the ability of those groups to enjoy group synergies and benefit from economies of scale, thus creating barriers to the cross-border allocation of resources and functions within a group. Additionally, allocating resources within a group, where all entities are subject to the same internal controls and procedures, carries a lower level of risk compared to outsourcing to external parties. The current approach, however, does not sufficiently distinguish between the risks associated with intragroup resource allocation and external outsourcing. Therefore, organisational requirements for trading venues should be simplified for trading venues that are part of a group and that intend to rely on the resources of or the performance of a function by another entity that is part of the same group and that is located in the Union. Such group arrangements should not be considered outsourcing for the purpose of Regulation No (EU) 600/2014, provided that certain conditions are met to ensure effective supervision. A trading venue that relies on the resources of or the performance of a function by another entity that is part of the same group should however remain fully responsible for the discharge of its obligations under Regulation No (EU) 600/2014. Given the increased supervisory risks, an intra-group arrangement that involves an entity located outside the Union should still be considered outsourcing.  (31) Article 53(6) of Directive 2014/65/EU sets out the right for a regulated market authorised in one Member State to provide appropriate arrangements on the territory of other Member States so as to facilitate access to and trading on that market by remote members or participants established in those other Member States. Directive 2014/65/EU does not expressly regulate other passporting rights for regulated markets, including the possibility to set up branches in other Member States. The absence of an explicit provision has led to diverging interpretations with respect to whether a regulated market may set up a branch in another Member State and with respect to the activities that a regulated market may perform under the passporting regime. It is important to enhance the clarity of the passporting regime for regulated markets by making it more explicit that regulated markets are able to seamlessly provide the activity, for which they have been authorised across the Union through the freedom to provide services or through the right of establishment. That includes, in addition to the provision of appropriate arrangements to facilitate access to and trading on that regulated market by remote members or participants established in other Member State, activities relating to the admission of members or participants on that regulated market and activities relating to the admission of financial instruments to trading on that regulated market. To ensure a level playing field between all trading venues, the same passporting regime should apply to market operators and investment firms operating an MTF or OTF.  (32) Directive 2014/65/EU currently requires that each regulated market in the Union is subject to an individual authorisation. It follows that market operators that intend to operate regulated markets in different Member States can only do so by seeking authorisation, for each individual regulated market that they intend to operate, from the competent authority of the home Member State, which is also responsible for the ongoing supervision of that market. That led to the situation where several Member States had introduced national laws to require, as a condition for the authorisation of a regulated market, that the market operator is a legal entity established in the Member State where a regulated market seeks authorisation. Due to that, groups operating regulated markets in several Member States cannot streamline their organisational structure and supervisory relationships, as they are obliged to maintain several supervised entities in different Member States. That significantly increases the costs and complexity of operating regulated markets across different Member States. To remove barriers and reduce operational costs for cross-border groups, it is necessary to remove the possibility for Member States to require the set-up of a separate legal entity in their territories as a condition for the authorisation of a regulated market. In addition, to further facilitate the cross - border operation of regulated markets, a new framework is introduced to allow legal persons that wish to operate more than one trading venue in more than one Member State to do so based on a single authorisation as a pan-European market operator (‘PEMO’) granted by ESMA. That new framework should not replace the existing authorisation and operation regime for regulated markets. Instead, it should apply on a voluntary basis to those entities that wish to operate under a single authorisation.  (33) The authorisation of a PEMO should list all the trading venues that the PEMO is authorised to operate. A PEMO that intends to operate additional trading venues should seek an extension of its original authorisation. To ensure that the supervisory arrangements of a PEMO are effectively simplified, the PEMO should not be required to seek individual authorisation for the trading venues that it operates in the Member States where those trading venues are situated or operated. Similarly, when a PEMO becomes the operator of an existing trading venue, the authorisation granted to that specific regulated market, or, in the case of MTFs or OTFs, to the market operator or investment firm for the purpose of operating that trading venue, should be deemed revoked upon the entry into effect of the authorisation to the PEMO or of the extended authorisation containing the amended list of the trading venues that that PEMO operates.  (34) Under Union and national laws, the territory where a trading venue is situated or operated is often used as the criterion to determine the national law that should apply to areas not directly governed by Union law, and to identify the competent authority. That includes Directive 2004/109/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, which establishes requirements in relation to the disclosure of periodic and ongoing information about issuers whose securities are already admitted to trading on a regulated market situated or operating within a Member State, and Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council, pursuant to which national competent authorities are required to ensure that market abuse provisions are applied on their territory regarding all actions carried out in relation to instruments admitted to trading or traded on a regulated market, an MTF or an OTF operating within their territory. A PEMO will operate, whether through the freedom to provide services or by establishing a branch, trading venues in multiple Member States on the basis of a single licence that is given to the PEMO itself and not to the trading venues that it operates. In the absence of an individual authorisation for each trading venue operated by a PEMO, and considering that the PEMO will operate all venues through one legal entity established in one Member State and operating cross-border, it is necessary that the PEMO determines, for each trading venues that it operates, the Member State in the territory of which that trading venue is to be considered to be situated or operated. This determination should depend on how the PEMO chooses to market its trading venue to companies seeking admission to trading on that trading venue or to members or participants admitted on that trading venue. The national laws of that Member State should apply to all matters relating to trading not governed by directly applicable Union law, where that application is dependent on the situation or operation of a trading venue. To ensure legal predictability, in cases where a PEMO becomes the operator of a trading venue that is already authorised, it is necessary to require that such trading venue is considered to be situated or operated in the Member State where it was initially authorised.  (35) ESMA assessed the trading activity of interest rate derivatives. It appeared from the assessment that forward rate agreements and single currency interest rate basis swaps are generally illiquid. To ensure that only the most standardised and liquid interest rate derivatives are subject to the transparency requirements, it is necessary  to exclude forward rate agreements and single currency interest rate basis swaps from transparency requirements.  (36) Article 14 of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 requires systematic internalisers that deal in sizes of up to and including two times the standard market size to make public firm quotes on a regular and continuous basis during normal trading hours in respect of those shares, depositary receipts, ETFs, certificates and other similar financial instruments traded on a trading venue, for which they are systematic internalisers and for which there is a liquid market. Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 requires systematic internalisers to execute orders they receive from their clients in respect of those instruments at the quoted prices at the time of reception of the order. That Article also allows systematic internalisers to execute clients’ orders at a better price provided that the price falls within a public range close to market conditions. To strengthen price formation for retail orders, it is necessary to ensure that, where a systematic internaliser executes a retail client’s order , specifically flagged as such, at a price that is better than the quoted price, that systematic internaliser immediately , and in any event before execution, updates the quoted price to reflect that price improvement. In addition, systematic internalisers should be obliged to transmit to the consolidated tape for shares and ETFs the data that they publish pursuant to Article 14 of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 to allow the consolidated tape to disseminate, for a given share or ETF, in addition to the best bids and offers for continuous order books, separately, the five best bid and offer quotes across the Union published by systematic internalisers with the indication of the individual systematic internaliser where those are offered. Those five best bid and offer quotes should correspond to the five best bid and offer quotes across all quotes for a given share or ETF published in the Union by different systematic internalisers.  (37) Article 21(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 requires investment firms which, either on own account or on behalf of clients, conclude transactions in OTC derivatives as referred to in Article 8a(2) of that Regulation, to make public the volume and price of those transactions and the time at which they were concluded through an Approved Publication Arrangement (‘APA’). To minimise burden for investment firms and to avoid the publication of misleading information, investment firms should not be required to publish through an APA the transactions in OTC derivatives that they conclude on a third-country trading venue, provided that the third-country trading venue (i) operates a multilateral system, (ii) is subject to authorisation, ongoing supervision and enforcement in accordance with the legal and supervisory framework of the third-country, and (iii) is subject to post-trade transparency provisions under which transactions concluded on that trading venue are published as soon as possible after the transaction was executed or, in clearly defined situations, after a deferral period. To ensure legal certainty and a high degree of supervisory convergence in the Union, ESMA should publish and regularly update a list of third-country trading venues that are considered to meet all criteria. Investment firms concluding transactions in OTC derivatives on third-country trading venues that do not meet all criteria should be required to make those transactions public in the Union through an APA.  (38) Articles 57 and 58 of Directive 2014/65/EU set out rules as regards the trading of commodity derivatives, emission allowances, and derivatives of emission allowances. Some of those rules are applicable to trading venues. As rules regarding the operation of trading venues are transferred from Directive 2014/65/EU to Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, it is appropriate to amend Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 to ensure that those rules are included in that Regulation.  (39) Articles 35 and 36 of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 provide for the conditions, under which trading venues can access the services of a central counterparty (‘CCP’), and under which CCPs can access the trade feeds of a trading venue. Those criteria have proven to be inappropriately framed and thus leave grounds for unjustified rejections or delays in granting access. In addition, the systematic involvement of national competent authorities renders the procedures excessively complex and burdensome. It is therefore appropriate to review those conditions for access to ensure rejections only occur in limited cases subject to the specific and justified conditions, to ensure that delays in granting access are avoided, and that ESMA is involved only in the case of conflicts between parties. In addition, trading venues may currently preclude two market participants executing a transaction on their venue from freely choosing different CCPs, even where those CCPs have established interoperability arrangements pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, and are therefore technically able to clear efficiently those transactions. Such market practices prevent the full exploitation of synergies that can be drawn from interoperability arrangements and increase costs of trading and clearing for market participants. In order to facilitate interoperable clearing, it is therefore necessary to prohibit trading venues from preventing access to their trade feeds for transactions involving two counterparties that have chosen to clear a transaction executed on their venue through two different CCPs that have established interoperability arrangements.  (40) Pursuant to Title VI of Directive 2014/65/EU, national competent authorities are currently responsible for the oversight of trading venues in the Union. On 20 March 2025 22 , the European Council adopted conclusions where it called for the improvement of the efficiency of supervision of Union capital markets and the reduction of their fragmentation. Furthermore, the Draghi and Letta reports 23 called for a more integrated supervision at the Union level. To reduce fragmentation and foster consistency in supervisory outcomes to support the establishment of a Savings and Investment Union, it is appropriate to confer on ESMA direct supervisory powers for significant trading venues with an important cross-border dimension. ESMA should also have direct supervisory powers over PEMOs. To determine what should be understood by ‘significant trading venues’, it is necessary to set out specific conditions. To avoid multiple supervisors for entities within the same group, it is also necessary to ensure that all entities that operate trading venues within the same group become subject to supervision by ESMA, once any entity within that group meets the conditions to be a significant trading venue. Similarly, all entities that operate trading venues in the group, in which at least one CCP or CSD is subject to supervision by ESMA, should also become subject to supervision by ESMA.  (41) For ESMA to ensure effective oversight over PEMOs and significant trading venues, ESMA should have the necessary supervisory powers, including the powers to conduct investigations and on-site inspections, to impose fines or periodic penalty payments to put an end to an infringement of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 , and to request the necessary information. To ensure that ESMA adequately performs its supervisory duties over PEMOs and significant trading venues, it is important that ESMA carries out such duties in close cooperation with national surveillance authorities. To avoid inefficient supervisory approaches resulting from double supervision, the involvement of national surveillance authorities should be limited to the powers and tasks explicitly conferred upon them by Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 and Directive 2014/65/EU.  (42) Considering the geographical proximity of national supervisors with the local ecosystems, it is necessary , for significant trading venues and PEMOs, that the responsibility for the surveillance of markets and oversight of issuers , remains with authorities that are competent at national level. Therefore, while ESMA should be in charge of enforcing the rules laid down in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 vis-à-vis significant trading venues and PEMOs and, where relevant, the rules laid down in Directive 2014/65/EU, including with respect to the assessment of effective systems and controls aiming to prevent and detect market abuse or the assessment of parameters for halting trading, national surveillance authorities should retain some powers to enable those authorities to perform market surveillance tasks or carry out duties necessary for the preservation of market integrity. Those powers should include the receipt of transaction data, the possibility to request order book data, or the adoption of urgent measures to impose temporary trading halts in emergency situations or suspend financial instruments from trading. When exercising their powers, national surveillance authorities should cooperate closely with ESMA.  (43) To ensure equal treatment as regards supervisory oversight of operators of trading venues, ESMA should become the competent authority for all relevant trading venues, including those operated by investment firms. It follows that ESMA should be entrusted with the authorisation and supervision of investment firms in case they wish to be exclusively authorised to operate relevant MTFs or OTFs. Investment firms that simultaneously operate MTFs or OTFs, that are subject to ESMA supervision, and perform other investment activities or provide other investment services should remain under national supervision for those other investment services and activities. To ensure that those investment firms maintain one point of entry and contact with a single supervising authority when seeking authorisation, it is necessary to introduce a specific framework for the authorisation of those investment firms. Where those investment firms wish to be initially authorised to perform other investment services together with the operation of MTFs or OTFs, the national competent authority of the Member State where those applicant investment firms are based should be entrusted with the authorisation, considering that their authorisation also covers other services that are not under ESMA supervision. Nevertheless, in those cases, to ensure ESMA can perform its duties as competent authority for relevant trading venues, it should provide the national competent authority with a binding opinion on the authorisation of the trading venues. The national competent authority concerned should not authorise the applicant investment firms to operate MTFs or OTFs in case of a negative opinion by ESMA. The same approach should be followed in case an investment firm, originally authorised to provide other investment services, wishes to extend its authorisation to the operation of MTFs or OTFs that are subject to ESMA supervision. In case of a negative opinion by ESMA, the extension of the authorisation should not be granted by the national competent authority. Lastly, where an investment firm authorised by ESMA to exclusively operate MTFs or OTFs seeks to extend its authorisation to other investment services, the national competent authority of the Member State where the investment firm is based should issue to ESMA a binding opinion on the provision of the additional investment services. In case of a negative opinion, ESMA should not extend the authorisation.  (44) To ensure that trading venues are subject to the most appropriate supervisory model, it is important to put in place a process whereby trading venues deemed significant are placed under ESMA’s supervision, while introducing the possibility for trading venues that no longer meet the conditions to be ‘significant’ to revert to national supervision. In that context, ESMA should identify which trading venues meet the conditions to qualify as significant, and should regularly monitor whether trading venues continue to meet those conditions over time. To ensure that the change of a supervisory model occurs smoothly and without causing excessive burden for trading venues, it is important to establish an appropriate timeline and a supervisory transition plan, developed through a thorough collaboration between ESMA and the national supervisory authority concerned. To provide clarity to market participants, ESMA should also establish and regularly update a list of all significant trading venues under its supervision and publish it on its website.  (45) Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council 24 sets out standardised requirements for the settlement of financial instruments and rules on the organisation and conduct of central securities depositories (CSDs) to promote safe, efficient and smooth settlement.  (46) In 2025, the Commission consulted stakeholders on their views on the barriers to the integration and modernisation of post-trading infrastructures in general, and on the barriers to the provision of cross-border services in the area of post trading in particular. The feedback indicated that stakeholders support and consider relevant the objective of Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 to promote safe, efficient and smooth settlement of financial instruments, but underlined the need to adapt that Regulation to technological innovation while ensuring fair competition between providers of settlement services.  (47) The concepts used and the rules laid down, in Regulation (EU) No 909/2014, should not hinder the use of any particular technology, including distributed ledger technology (DLT). To account for innovation and the application of new technologies in the provision of CSD services, in particular whe re those services are provided using DLT, Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 should be amended to ensure that all definitions, concepts and requirements should be update d so that they can be applied to situations in which a CSD provides its services using DLT. It is equally necessary to ensure that certain tokenised assets , including e-money tokens can be used as a means of payment when settling securities transactions or to pay penalties for settlement fails.  (48) Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 should take into account developments in DLT in the provision of CSD services so that entities authorised under the pilot regime provided for in Regulation (EU) 2022/858 25 can fall under the scope of Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 once they have outgrown that regime. Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 should also allow CSDs established in the Union that intend, from the very beginning, to provide CSD services in relation to DLT-based securities whose value would exceed the thresholds set out in Regulation (EU) 2022/858, to seek an authorisation directly under Regulation (EU) No 909/2014.  (49) Considering the significant volumes and values of securities transactions settled by settlement internalisers, it is important to strengthen the monitor ing of the potential legal and operational risks related to that activity. The granularity of volume and value reporting requirements for settlement internalisers should therefore be increased and information on settlement fails included in reports to facilitate such risk monitoring. In addition, to ensure that market participants can compare prices of settlement services provided by settlement internalisers with prices of those services provided by CSDs, settlement internalisers should disclose their prices and fees to their clients.  (50) CSDs in the Union are authorised and supervised by the competent authorities of the Member States in which they are established , in cooperation with a college of supervisors where th os e CSDs offer services of substantial importance in two or more host Member States. Despite progress so far, diverging supervisory practices for CSDs amongst those national authorities persist, creating an unlevel playing field among CSDs in the Union and increasing the costs and burden for CSDs and groups of CSDs operating and seeking to operate cross-border . With the development of deeper, more liquid Union capital markets under the SIU, that unlevel playing field increase s the risk of supervisory arbitrage which could lead to financial stability issues. T o ensure that the prudential, organisational and business conduct requirements for CSDs established in the Union are applied in a uniform manner, in particular for CSDs with substantial settlement activity, CSDs with a material cross-border dimension, and CSDs that are part of a group that includes other market infrastructures that are supervised by ESMA, should be supervised by ESMA, based on its expertise and experience in the application of Regulation (EU) No 909/2014.  (51) To determine which CSDs authorised under Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 should be subject to supervision by ESMA, it is necessary to lay down clear and objective criteria for their identification, including criteria based on size and cross-border activity. With the aim of simplification and of avoiding unnecessary administrative burden, a CSD that has already been authorised should not be re-authorised by ESMA once it becomes significant .  (52) Given CSDs’ central role in securities markets, their connection to other financial market infrastructures and the fact that most of the volume of settlement transactions in CSDs in the Union happens in central bank money, ESMA should develop deep and comprehensive cooperation arrangements with other authorities, in particular the ECB and other central banks of issue of the most relevant Union currencies that the CSDs settle in. Such cooperation arrangements should cover the close involvement of those other authorities in the daily supervision of significant CSDs and should include arrangements for regular events, such as onsite inspections, and ad hoc events, such as emergency situations.  (53) The amendments to Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010, and in particular the changes to ESMA’s internal organisational structure and the shift in supervisory responsibilities, should be reflected in Regulation (EU) No 909/2014. In addition, taking into account the shift in supervisory responsibilities, the involvement of national competent authorities in ESMA’s governance structure, and to avoid any duplicative assignment of tasks between ESMA and the supervisory college, significant CSDs should no longer be required to have a college.  (54) As opposed to significant CSDs, less significant CSDs d o not have substantial cross-border activities. They should therefore remain under the supervision of their national competent authorities. Supervisory arrangements for less significant CSDs should largely remain as they were. However, to ensure a consistent supervisory approach for those CSDs, it is necessary to provide for stronger cooperation between those national competent authorities with ESMA. In case they wish to do so, Member States should have the option to designate ESMA as the competent authority for less significant C SD s established in their jurisdictions. Moreover, should a previously significant C SD no longer meet the conditions to be considered as such, a sufficient transition period should be granted to the national competent authority to allow it to prepare before formally taking over supervisory responsibilities for that C SD . Alternatively, the national competent authority should be able to leave the supervision of this previously significant CSD to ESMA. In addition, to ensure consistency and a level playing field between significant and less significant CSDs, ESMA should also be the authority responsible for authorising interoperability arrangements such as, in the context of CSD services, interoperable links. For these purposes, ESMA should also be responsible for chair ing the colleges for less significant CSDs.  (55) To modernise the exchange of information and to allow for faster procedures , ESMA should establish and maintain an electronic central database in the form of a platform. All relevant competent authorities and bodies referred to in Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 should have access to such platform for the information that is pertinent for their tasks and responsibilities. E ntities subject to Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 should have access to the information and documentation they have submitted and any documentation that is addressed to them. T o ensure the swift and efficient sharing of information and documentation under Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 , t he central database should be used to share as much information and documentation as possible.  (56) To allow groups of CSDs to benefit from their consolidation, Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 should enable CSDs that are part of a group to outsource their core services to CSDs that are part of the same group. In addition, situations where a CSD wish es to provide its core services by using a DLT solution it developed should not be considered as outsourcing but rather as an extension of the CSD’s authorisation.  (57) The requirement to ensure the integrity of securities’ issuance applies equally to conventional CSDs and CSDs using DLT. For CSDs using DLT , the rules should take into account the specific ways in which DLT works by allow ing for appropriate reconciliation measures to be performed by nodes verifying that the number of securities making up a securities issue or part of a securities issue submitted to the CSD is equal to the sum of securities recorded on the securities accounts of the participants of the securities settlement system operated by the CSD.  (58) CSDs should be able to take advantage of the functionality offered by a common settlement infrastructure offering securities settlement with central bank money, in particular where such common settlement infrastructure provides for liquidity optimisation tools and promotes safe and efficient settlement , including across borders. T o give to their participants the possibility to settle their securities transactions on that common settlement infrastructure, CSDs that offer settlement in currencies available on such a common settlement infrastructure should be required to directly connect to it. The requirement to connect to a common settlement infrastructure should take into account the technological developments in the area of central bank money settlement.  (59) Regulation (EU) 11 1 4/2023 of the European Parliament and of the Council 26 sets out a framework for the safe issuance in the Union of e-money tokens. To support innovation in securities settlement, CSDs in the Union should be able to settle the payments of securities transactions in e-money tokens, subject to appropriate safeguards. Th at possibility should be available to both CSDs that are authorised to provide banking-type ancillary services and CSDs that are not. CSDs that are not authorised to provide banking-type ancillary services should be able to settle the payments in e-money tokens, in any currency, through accounts opened with CSDs that are authorised to provide banking-type ancillary services or through accounts opened with a credit institution, subject to the threshold determined by EBA for the settlement of payments in commercial bank money.  (60) Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 sets out rules for the establishment and the maintenance of link arrangements set up between CSDs. To foster the provision of cross-border services, the access to another CSD in the Union via a standard link should be facilitated and the related process simplified. In addition, with the aim of fostering further integration of Union capital markets, CSDs should be required to establish a minimum number of bilateral links. To ensure proportionality, the number of links a CSD should be required to establish should depend on the significance of the CSD.  (61) This amending Regulation introduces targeted amendments to Regulation (EU) 2019/1156 with the aim of removing barriers to the cross-border marketing of AIFs and UCITS, harmonising rules on marketing communications and strengthening ESMA’s powers to foster a common supervisory culture and better coordinate activities across home and host national competent authorities.  (62) The marketing of AIFs and UCITS is not always conducted by the AIFM, EuVECA or EuSEF manager, or UCITS management company directly but by one or several distributors either on behalf of those managers or on their own behalf. Arrangements whereby a distributor acts on behalf of the AIFM, EuVECA or EuSEF manager, or UCITS management company should be considered to be delegation arrangements subject to the provisions of Directive 2011/61/EU, Regulation (EU) No 345/2013, Regulation (EU) No 346/2013 and Directive 2009/65/EC regarding delegation. To ensure legal clarity, Regulation (EU) 2019/1156 is amended to clarify that where the marketing function is delegated to a third party acting on behalf of the AIFM, EuVECA or EuSEF manager, and UCITS management company, the latter remain responsible for ensuring that the marketing communications prepared and addressed to investors are compliant with the requirements of that Regulation. On the other hand, where a distributor acts on its own behalf and markets an AIF or UCITS under Directive 2014/65/EU or through life-insurance based investment products in accordance with Directive (EU) 2016/97, the provisions of Directive 2011/61/EU and Directive 2009/65/EC regarding delegation do not apply. Regulation (EU) 2019/1156 is therefore amended to clarify that in those cases where the marketing function is performed by one or several distributors acting on their own behalf, those distributors (and not the AIFM or UCITS management company) are liable to ensure that the marketing communications that they prepare and address to investors are compliant with the requirements of this Regulation.  (63) To reduce unnecessary delays and divergent supervisory practices and to facilitate the seamless marketing of AIFs and UCITS in the Single Market, it is appropriate that Regulation (EU) 2019/1156 prohibits the competent authorities of the host Member State from requiring the notification of marketing communications as a prior condition for the marketing of AIFs and UCITS in their territory. In order to protect investors in the host Member State and improve supervisory cooperation and effectiveness, where the competent authorities of the host Member State have reasonable grounds to believe that marketing communications are not in compliance with Regulation (EU) 2019/1156 or the relevant Commission delegated acts, they retain the right to request the competent authorities of the home Member State of the AIFM, EuVECA or EuSEF manager or UCITS to take all appropriate measures to prevent or penalise further irregularities. The competent authorities of host Member States may further refer the matter to ESMA if they are not satisfied with the actions taken by the home competent authorities.  (64) In order to ensure high levels of transparency on the fees or charges levied by host competent authorities for carrying out their duties in relation to AIFs and UCITS marketed in their territory and to facilitate the recovery of those fees or charges, ESMA should publish up to date information on the amount of fees or charges levied by each host competent authority, their frequency and the modalities of their payment. To ensure consistency of the fees or charges levied by competent authorities, ESMA should , every 2 years, analyse whether such fees or charges are consistent with the overall cost relating to the performance of the functions of the competent authorities and submit a report to the Commission on that basis.  (65) To facilitate the marketing of AIFs and UCITS across the Union and to optimise the interactions and the exchange of information between home and host Member States, it is appropriate and necessary for ESMA to establish a “one-stop-shop” for the cross-border marketing of AIFs and UCITS, that would allow competent authorities to easily transmit and exchange information and documentation on marketing notifications. It is therefore essential that ESMA develops a data platform for marketing notifications and de-notifications that would be accessible to all competent authorities. UCITS and AIFMs should provide all information and documentation necessary for the marketing of AIFs and UCITS across the Union, including any amendments thereof to the competent authorities of their home Member State and the latter will in turn transmit them to  ESMA through that data platform. All relevant host competent authorities should have immediate and direct access to the information and documentation in connection with the UCITS and AIFs marketed in their territory through the data platform. The data platform will simplify and expedite the passporting procedure for UCITS and AIFMs, allowing for immediate Single Market access upon their authorisation, as well as increasing transparency and cooperation among competent authorities. To fund the expenditure relating to the new passporting procedure, including the appropriate share of maintenance costs of the data platform that is utilised for that purpose, ESMA should charge UCITS and AIFMs a fee when they avail of the passporting based on authorisation procedure. The fee structure should be commensurate to the number of host Member States in which the units of UCITS or AIFs are marketed.  (66) To ensure a consistent implementation and greater harmonisation of marketing requirements and notification procedures across Member States, the provisions of Directive 2011/61/EU and Directive 2009/65/EC as regards the marketing of EU AIFs managed by EU AIFMs to professional investors and the marketing of UCITS across the Union are transferred to Regulation (EU) 2019/1156.  (67) EU AIFMs marketing EU AIFs to professional investors, and UCITS marketing their units across the Union, are already authorised and subject to strict regulatory safeguards and prudential requirements. However, the cross-border marketing of UCITS and AIFs remains hampered by lengthy notification procedures and divergent national requirements and administrative practices, including obligations relating to translations, the appointment of local agents and differing national deadlines. Those divergences hinder the functioning of the internal market, as UCITS and AIFs must navigate a patchwork of national rules and processes when operating in several Member States. It is therefore necessary to streamline marketing notification and de-notification procedures, shorten processing times and remove national requirements that create obstacles to the cross-border marketing of investment funds. For that purpose, Regulation (EU) 2019/1156 is amended to allow UCITS and AIFMs, at the time of their authorisation, to notify their home Member State of their intention to market units or shares of UCITS or AIFs in other Member States through a simplified procedure. Once the home Member State has received the required information and documentation through the authorisation application , it should transmit it to the ESMA data platform. That information should be automatically accessible to host Member States and, from the moment of its transmission to the data platform, UCITS and AIFs should enjoy unrestricted access to the markets of those Member States.  (68) The de-notification of marketing arrangements should likewise be subject to the simplified procedure, allowing UCITS and AIFMs to notify their intention to terminate marketing activities in a host Member State to their home competent authority, who will in turn notify the relevant host Member States and ESMA through the data platform.  (69) Although the requirement of a physical presence as a precondition for the marketing of UCITS and AIFs in a host Member State is prohibited, Member States often require, through market practice or otherwise, the appointment of a local agent to conduct certain tasks locally. Such practices undermine the functioning of the Single Market and generate unnecessary costs and complexity for funds marketed across the Union. It is therefore necessary to clarify that host Member States should not impose, through market practice or otherwise, any form of physical local presence obligation on UCITS and AIFs marketed in their territory, even where such presence is not formally a precondition for marketing but creates additional burdens or places those funds at a disadvantage compared to domestic funds.  (70) To ensure greater harmonisation in the exercise of supervisory powers by the competent authorities of home and host Member States, the provisions of Directive 2011/61/EU and Directive 2009/65/EC concerning supervisory powers over UCITS and AIFs marketed across the Union should be transferred into Regulation (EU) 2019/1156. In order to promote effective cooperation between home and host competent authorities and to ensure that any potential disagreements are resolved efficiently and without creating obstacles to the marketing of UCITS and AIFs within the Union, it is necessary to clarify that the competent authorities of host Member States should refer to ESMA any matters of disagreement with the competent authorities of the home Member State of the UCITS or AIFM, or cases where the host Member State considers that the marketing of a UCITS or AIF should be prohibited in its territory. In such cases, ESMA should resolve the matter in accordance with its powers to address cross-border issues.  (71) To ensure the effective functioning of the Single Market for investment funds and remove supervisory obstacles that impede the cross-border exercise of passporting rights, ESMA should be empowered to detect and address instances of divergent, duplicative, redundant or deficient supervisory practices that hinder the cross-border marketing of UCITS and AIFs or instances where the cross-border marketing of UCITS or AIFs does not comply with Union law. In those cases, ESMA should implement an escalation process, starting with engaging with competent authorities and stakeholders, fostering greater collaboration between them and, where necessary, using its convergence and intervention powers so that unjustified restrictions on cross-border activities or cases of non-compliance with EU law are remedied in a timely and effective manner. For the same reasons, it is necessary to ensure that, if those problems persist despite this escalation process, ESMA should then exercise its powers to launch breach of Union law procedures in accordance with Article 17 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010, to suspend the right to market UCITS or AIFs on a cross-border basis in accordance with Article 17aaa of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 , to arrange binding mediation in accordance with Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 or to organise collaboration platforms in accordance with A rticle 19a of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 , where appropriate, in order to effectively remedy those problems.  (72) To ensure consistent supervision and effective cooperation between competent authorities of Member States, competent authorities should be able to refer to ESMA any disagreements on assessments, actions, or omissions in areas where Regulation (EU) 2019/1156 requires coordination, so that ESMA can intervene using the powers conferred on it under Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.  (73) It is necessary to amend Regulation (EU) 2021/23 to account for ESMA’s new role as the supervisor of significant CCPs and the abolition of colleges for th ose CCPs .  (74) Whereas Regulation (EU) 2022/858 was adopted to promote the uptake of distributed ledger technology (DLT) in the financial sector, by providing for an EU pilot regime that allows market participants to experiment with the use of DLT for the trading and settlement of financial instruments. Three years after the entry into application of the Regulation, its uptake remains moderate , with a limited number of approved applicants, despite a growing interest in the market in using DLT for financial services. In line with the objective set in the priorities for achieving the Savings and Investment Union of enhancing the interoperability, interconnection and efficiency of EU trading and post-trading infrastructures, it appears justified to review the current regulatory setting of Regulation (EU) 2022/858 to ensure that the DLT Pilot Regulation is better capable of accompanying regulated firms wanting to leverage DLT for trading and post-trading . To achieve this objective, the review broadly comprises two sets of amendments: firstly, those that aim to increase the flexibility and proportionality of the framework and, secondly, those that aim to extend its scale and scope.  (75) DLT is used, among others, for the issuance, recording and transferring of financial instruments. As such, where appropriate operational risk management is implemented by its users, it does not make the financial instruments managed through DLT inherently riskier than the instruments managed based on other, functionally analogous technologies. Therefore, the scope of eligible assets and financial instruments admitted to trading on a DLT market infrastructure, or to be recorded on a DLT market infrastructure under this Regulation should be expanded to cover all financial instruments, regardless of their type, subject to appropriate application of investor protection rules.  (76) Regulation (EU) 2022/858 lays down various limits to the scale of activities carried out under the Pilot, with limits to the issuance size and market capitalisation of assets eligible for the DLT Pilot (asset-specific caps), and an aggregate cap that limits the total value of financial instruments intermediated by a DLT market infrastructure of EUR 6 billion. Those activity thresholds have made it difficult for certain large market participants to use the Pilot framework for their activity and develop large scale business models. Therefore, all asset-specific caps should be withdrawn, whereas the aggregate cap should be raised to EUR 100 billion. To mitigate risks from increased activity, those changes should be accompanied by targeted increases in prudential requirements for those Pilot participants providing CSD services that wish to benefit from increased thresholds.   At the same time, to make it easier for small innovative companies to use the DLT Pilot for their activities , a simplified regime comprising obligations that are proportionate to the risk and size of those companies should be established. The simplified regime should be open to operators of a DLT TSS or a DLT SS where the aggregate market value of all DLT financial instruments that they service does not exceed EUR 10 billion at the moment of admission to trading or initial recording of a new DLT financial instrument.  (77) Regulation (EU) 2022/858 limits the types of eligible entities that can participate in the Pilot, which have to be either trading venues authorised under Directive 2014/65 or CSDs. That approach excludes regulated financial entities that have an interest and experience in organising trading and transfers of digital assets to participate in the Pilot, namely the crypto-assets services providers (CASP) that operate trading platforms. Therefore, those CASPs should be allowed, under certain conditions and subject to their compliance with the relevant requirements set out in Directive 2014/65, Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 and Regulation (EU) No 909/2014, as applicable, to obtain a specific permission to operate a DLT trading venue (DLT TV) or a DLT trading and settlement system (DLT TSS). Accordingly, the rules laid down for entities operating DLT market infrastructure should be apply to CASPs.  (78) Regulation (EU) 2022/858 grants its participants the possibility to request exemptions from specific provisions of the sectoral legislation. However, certain provisions of sectoral legislation may be identified as incompatible with DLT only by applicants to the Pilot themselves, as they develop their business models and apply for a permission to operate a DLT market infrastructure, or after obtaining the permission. To ensure flexibility of the Pilot regime in supporting innovation, the competent authorities should be allowed to grant requests for exemptions from provisions belonging to the specified parts of sectoral legislation under certain conditions. Such requests should be based on clear justification by the DLT TV or DLT SS operators that the required exemption is incompatible or disproportionate with the use of DLT, and should be accompanied, where appropriate, with compensatory measures that can achieve the objective of the provision for which the exemption is requested. To ensure supervisory convergence between competent authorities granting the exemptions, ESMA should be closely involved in granting the requests by issuing non-binding opinions on the requests and assessments made by the competent authorities.  (79) Finding robust solutions for settlement of the cash leg in commercial bank money may be more difficult in the nascent market of DLT market infrastructures. To support operators of a DLT SS or a DLT TSS in finding efficient solutions for processing commercial bank money payments within their settlement systems, they should be able to designate credit institutions whose banking activities are not limited to CSDs but otherwise comply with Title IV of Regulation (EU) No 909/2014. Furthermore, to increase legal certainty for existing projects developed under the Pilot, settlement in commercial bank money executed by an investment firm operating a DLT TSS should be explicitly recognised, provided it sufficiently monitors the risks arising from its settlement model .  (80) Since e-money tokens have emerged as one of the most widely used means of DLT-based settlement, further legal clarity should be provided for the use of e-money tokens in the Pilot. To recognise that Regulation (EU) 2023/1114, adopted after Regulation (EU) 2022/858, governs the services of custody of e-money tokens , it should be specified that e-money tokens cash accounts for the purpose settlement may be provided by a set of appropriately regulated financial institutions, including CASPs. However, it should be laid down that most banking type ancillary services with regards to e-money tokens , other than providing cash accounts and processing payments, may be provided only by credit institutions.  Furthermore, to promote the use of e-money tokens denominated in Union currencies and to protect the market from foreign exchange risk, settlement of payments for assets denominated in Union currencies should be carried out in e-money tokens referencing EU currencies. To support the development of euro denominated stablecoins, DLT market infrastructures should be encouraged to offer settlement in e-money tokens denominated in euro , even if the financial instrument that is settled is denominated in a non-EU currency.  (81) It is necessary to ensure that small businesses seeking to innovate are subject to requirements of Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 that are proportionate to their size and risk . For that reason , operators of a DLT SS or a DLT TSS benefiting from the simplified regime should , with regard to the provision of CSD services, only be subject to those provisions of Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 that are essential to ensure safe and robust provision of CSD services, while not setting a burdensome compliance standard. For the same reason , and to ensure that the delegated regulations adopted pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 are made proportionate to the risk and size of small businesses operating under the simplified regime, ESMA should be instructed to amend those delegated regulations for the needs of the simplified regime. To ensure that the requirements applicable to the Pilot participants become more stringent as businesses scale and risks increase, DLT market infrastructures wishing to transition to from the simplified to the regular regime should comply with all of the requirements of Regulation (EU) No 909/2014, as adapted and derogated from by Regulation (EU) 2022/858 . Given the novelty of the simplified regime for the activities of the DLT settlement system (DLT SS) or the DLT trading and settlement system (DLT TSS) introduced in this regulation, and to ensure supervisory convergence by competent authorities, ESMA should be mandated to issue guidelines on the implementation of that simplified regime .  (82) Distributed ledgers act as platforms on which financial intermediaries may provide financial services in a synchronised manner. In order to allow market participants to leverage the platform nature of distributed ledgers, the Pilot should make it possible for eligible financial entities to obtain a specific permission to perform an individual CSD service within the territory of the Union. Therefore, a legal person who is authorised as an investment firm, a regulated market, a credit institution, a CSD, or a CASP should be allowed to perform the DLT notary service or the DLT central maintenance service under the Pilot. To ensure these services are provided in accordance with the standards laid down in Regulation (EU) No 909/2014, while taking into account the specificities of DLT, DLT notaries and DLT account keepers should be subject to the provisions of that regulation that govern the application of the notary and the central maintenance service and the additional requirements for DLT market infrastructures set out in Regulation (EU) 2022/858.  (83) DLT financial instruments issued and safeguarded by the DLT notary and DLT account keepers outside a CSD should only be settled through a DLT SS, DLT TSS or a CSD operating solely under Regulation (EU) No 909/2014.  Furthermore, given the experimental nature of this model for the distributed provision of CSD services, the market value of DLT financial instruments issued and safeguarded by DLT notaries and DLT account keepers should be limited by allowing operators of a DLT SS, DLT TSS or a CSD operating solely under Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 to admit for settlement up to EUR 10 billion of market value of such instruments, which should be increased to EUR 30 billion of market value for transferable securities issued by SMEs.  (84) To reflect the distributed nature of roles and responsibilities that is possible under the Pilot with the creation of the DLT notary and DLT account keeper function, it should be made clear that where, for a given DLT financial instrument, a DLT notary or a DLT account keeper provides CSD core services jointly with a DLT SS, TSS or a CSD operating solely under Regulation (EU) No 909/2014, the DLT SS, TSS or CSD operating solely under Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 should not be liable for compliance with those requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 that are discharged by the DLT notary or a DLT account keeper.  (85) To ensure transparency on the market about joint provision of CSD services, ESMA should enter the information about each of the DLT notary and the DLT central maintenance service s operated by a specific DLT SS, TSS or a CSD operating solely under Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 in the CSD register maintained under Article 21 of Regulation (EU) No 909/2014.  (86) Additionally, because distributed ledgers allow its users to more easily synchronise and automate operations, the Pilot should allow market participants to experiment with a new business model that does not involve a single operator of a settlement system, but rather relies on regulated entities that are individually and jointly required, through the establishment of a settlement scheme, to ensure robust settlement outcomes. Given their experimental nature, these business models should be subject to the same thresholds as those applicable to DLT market infrastructures settling DLT financial instruments issued and safeguarded by DLT notaries and DLT account keepers. Additionally, to further mitigate risks stemming from this new business model, the eligible participants to settlement schemes should only be DLT account keepers, the settlement should be conducted through central bank money accounts managed by those DLT account keepers, and should be settled on a ‘ delivery versus payment’ basis . Additionally, to ensure the sound functioning of the settlement scheme, its participants should ensure safe, efficient and smooth settlement, protection of client assets and robust risk management of operations. In particular, to ensure robust management of credit and liquidity risks stemming from providing banking services to their clients, DLT account keepers participating in the scheme should comply with a set of prudential requirements on an ongoing basis. To ensure this compliance, the settlement scheme should be authorised and supervised by ESMA, in cooperation with competent authorities of the DLT account keepers participating in the scheme.  (87) To facilitate the development of DLT CSD services across Member States, DLT notaries and DLT account keepers should be allowed to provide CSD services throughout the Union, without being required to have a physical presence in the territory of a host Member State as long as they submit a list of the Member States in which they intend to provide CSD services to the competent authority of their home Member State , which is requested to then share this list with the competent authorities of the relevant host Member States and ESMA before t he DLT notary or the DLT account keeper may begin to provide CSD services in those host Member State s.  (88) To ensure that DLT market infrastructures do not fragment the Union’s trading and post-trading infrastructure and that they form a part of an integrated capital market DLT market infrastructures participa ting in the Pilot, as well as other interested parties, should form an industry group for the purpose of establish ing industry standards that facilitate settlement of DLT financial instruments between DLT market infrastructures . Building on the work of that industry group, ESMA should provide technical advice to the Commission on supporting interoperability between DLT market infrastructures.  (89) C olleges of supervisors should be established t o ensure the efficient supervision of the novel business models for CSD services allowed under the Pilot and the necessary cooperation and exchange of information between all the supervisors that those business models may involve . Firstly, colleges of supervisors should be established in accordance with Article 24a of Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 where a DLT SS or a DLT TSS operating under the regular regime provides CSD services and fulfils the conditions set out in that article. To ensure comprehensive involvement of all relevant authorities, competent authorities of the DLT notary or the DLT account keeper that is involved in the provision of CSD services and EBA, where e-money tokens are used for the settlement of payments , should be allowed to join the college of supervisors. Secondly, ESMA should also establish and chair a college of supervisors for settlement schemes, comprising ESMA, the competent authorities of DLT account keepers participating in the settlement scheme and the central bank in the Union of the currency that is or will be used for the settlement of cash payments in the settlement scheme. Competent authorities of DLT notaries participating in the settlement scheme should be able to participate in the college upon request.  (90) To remove any ambiguity in relation to the long-term viability of the Pilot, the time limits for the duration of the permissions granted in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2022/858 should no longer apply .  (91) Well-integrated crypto-asset markets depend on coordinated supervisory frameworks to operate efficiently, while more centralised supervision can, in turn, promote deeper market integration. Centralising supervisory powers and capacities at Union’s level, including by transferring direct supervisory responsibilities in the area of crypto-asset service providers is a critical element to further develop the mutually reinforcing dynamic between market integration and supervisory alignment.  (92) Because crypto-asset service providers are a new area of financial activity which has only recently come under supervision and because it is important to ensure supervisory consistency from the beginning, ESMA should exercise that centralised supervision, thereby guaranteeing a level playing field.  Crypto-asset services is also an area dominated by increased cross-border activity carried out using electronic means and new technology. Risks should therefore be monitored and addressed in a comprehensive and consistent manner. Centralised oversight should ensure the consistent application of standards and rules, mitigate supervisory gaps across jurisdictions and address the disproportionate impact a potential failure of crypto-asset service providers could have on the Union’s crypto-asset ecosystem. Centralised supervision should mean the danger of supervisory fragmentation will not materialise.  (93) In the fight against market abuse of crypto-assets admitted to trading or of which a request for admission to trading has been made, centralised market surveillance by ESMA and investigation powers for cross border cases should achieve economies of scale, overcome the issue of fragmented access to data, reduce reliance on international cooperation and ultimately give ESMA a better view over complex strategies taking place across jurisdictions.  (94) In this respect, ESMA should be responsible for the authorisation and supervision of the crypto-asset service providers and ongoing monitoring for market abuse in the crypto-asset sector.  (95) Certain firms subject to Union legislative acts on financial services are already allowed to provide all or some crypto-asset services without being required to obtain an authorization as a crypto-asset service provider under Regulation (EU) 2023/1114. These entities should continue to be supervised for their crypto-asset activities by the competent authorities that granted them authorisation under other Union acts. However, where the provision of crypto-asset services becomes the main activity of those entities, they should be treated as crypto-asset service providers and the supervision for all their activities should be transferred to ESMA. To fulfil this duty, ESMA should establish cooperation agreements with the competent authorities that authorised those entities under other Union legislative acts on financial services. On the basis of the cooperation agreement, those competent authorities shall provide support and assistance to ESMA in the supervision of the activities that are not covered by Regulation (EU) 2023/1114.  (96) As there is already a centralized system of banking supervision in the Union in the form of the Single Supervisory Mechanism, ensuring integration and consistency in the supervision of the activities of credit institutions, there should be no transfer of supervisory powers where the entity providing crypto-asset services is a credit institution.  (97) To supervise crypto-asset service providers, ESMA should have the powers to suspend or, prohibit the provision of a crypto-asset service, to withdraw the authorisation of a crypto-asset service provider, to investigate infringements of the rules on market abuse, to request information, to carry out on-site inspections and investigations, to take supervisory measures and to impose fines. When determining the type and level of an administrative penalty or other administrative measure, ESMA should take into account all relevant circumstances, including the gravity and the duration of the infringement and whether it was committed intentionally. In order to carry out its supervisory duties, ESMA should cooperate and be assisted by other competent authorities as well as the competent authorities responsible for the supervision of [Directive (EU) 2015/849].  (98) E SM A should charge fees to crypto-asset service providers to cover its costs for supervision , including for overheads , and the cost of conducting market surveillance to prevent market abuse . T he fee should be proportionate to the size of the crypto-asset service provider. T o avoid disruption to existing crypto-asset service providers , it is necessary to lay down transitional provisions for crypto-asset service providers that have been authorised pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2023/1114 and for applicants whose application for a crypto-asset service provider authorisation is currently being assessed by national competent authorities . For reasons of legal certainty, it is also appropriate to establish clear transitional measures for the transmission of files and working documents from the competent authorities to ESMA.  (99) T o avoid disruption to existing crypto-asset service providers, t he authorisation of a crypto-asset service provider by a competent authority should remain valid throughout the Union after the transition of supervisory powers from the competent authorities to ESMA.  (100) In order to fulfil the objectives of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the adoption of rules of procedures for the exercise of ESMA’s power to charge fees, for the imposition of fines and a settlement procedure, including the rights of defence, disclosure and effects of settlements. In addition, in order to ensure the effectiveness of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the specification of the fees to be paid to ESMA for the supervision of significant CCPs, the matters for which those fees are due, the calculation of the amount of those fees, and the manner in which those fees are to be paid , and in respect of amending the list of infringements for which ESMA can impose supervisory measures on significant CCPs. Furthermore, to ensure the effectiveness and the consistent application of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the specification of the fees to be paid by operators of the trading venues that are subject to supervision by ESMA, in respect of the conditions and methodologies used to determine whether a trading venue should be deemed significant, and in respect of the conditions under which a trading venue or a CCP should grant access to its services. In parallel, in order to ensure the effectiveness of Regulation (EU) No 909/2014, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the specification of the type of fees to be paid to ESMA for the supervision of significant CSDs, the matters for which those fees are due, the calculation of the amount of those fees and the manner in which they are to be paid; amending the list of infringements for which ESMA can impose supervisory measures; the further specification of the requirements applicable to the participation in a CSD, and the amendment of the conditions under which a CSD shall be subject to the obligation to establish bilateral links. In addition, in order to ensure that the activity thresholds laid down in Regulation (EU) 2022/858 can be modified in light of market developments and policy learnings from the pilot regime established by that act, the power to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the adaptation of those thresholds to, among others, market conditions and possible risks to financial stability. Furthermore, in order to ensure the effectiveness of Regulation (EU) 2023/1114, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of further specifying the type and the calculation of the amount of supervisory fees that ESMA can charge to the crypto-asset service providers. Lastly, to ensure an orderly application of provisions transferred from Directive 2014/65/EU to Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, it is appropriate to ensure that delegated acts and implementing acts that have been adopted on the basis of empowerments laid down in Directive 2014/65/EU that are to be transferred to Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, continue to apply. The Commission should be empowered to amend those delegated and implementing act in accordance with the procedures set out in Article 10(4a) or 15(4a) of Regulation (EU) No 1095/1010. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making 27 . In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States' experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.  (101) To ensure consistent application of the relevant provisions under Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, the Commission should be empowered to adopt, in accordance with Article 290 TFEU and Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010, regulatory technical standards developed by ESMA related to the authorisation of regulated markets and PEMOs, and to the operation of trading venues. Furthermore, to ensure consistent harmonisation of standards, the Commission should be empowered to adopt, in accordance with Article 290 TFEU and with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council 28 and of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010, regulatory technical standards developed by the European Banking Authority ('EBA') and by the European Securities and Markets Authority ('ESMA') with regard to the procedures for the calculation of the criteria for establishing the significance of a CSD and the set of data EU CSDs are to report to ESMA for such calculation; the measures to be put in place by CSDs and market participants to prevent settlement fails and to increase the settlement efficiency of Union capital markets; the conditions under which an outsourcing arrangement is to be considered as the outsourcing of core CSD services; the measures to be implemented by CSDs to mitigate the specific risks stemming from the provision of CSD services using DLT; and the risk management measures and prudential requirements with respect to the settlement in commercial bank money and in e-money tokens. In addition, in order to ensure consistent harmonisation in the fees to be charged by ESMA to UCITS and AIFMs in connection with the passporting procedure and the maintenance of the data platform, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission in respect of measures to specify the type, amount, frequency and the modalities governing the payment of those fees. Furthermore, in order to ensure consistent harmonisation in the marketing communications made available to investors, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the TFEU should be delegated to the Commission to specify the content and format of marketing communications. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making. In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States' experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts. Lastly, to identify the requirements of Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 that should apply to the providers of the DLT notary and DLT central account maintenance service, and adapt them to the use of distributed ledger technology and the specificities of business models involving DLT notaries and DLT account keepers, ESMA should develop draft regulatory technical standards to supplement the provisions of Title III of Regulation (EU) No 909/2014.  (102) In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of Regulation (EU) No 909/2014, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to adopt implementing technical standards developed by ESMA with regard to the standard forms, templates and procedures for the disclosure of fees and prices by CSDs and by settlement internalisers. Those powers should be exercised in in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.  (103) Regulations (EU) No 1095/2010, No 648/2012, No 600/2014, No 909/2014, 2015/2365, 2019/1156, 202 1/23, 2022/858 , 2023/1114 , No 1060/2009, 2016/1011, 2017/2402, 2023/2631 and 2024/3005 should therefore be amended accordingly.  (104) It is necessary to provide ESMA with sufficient time to prepare for its new supervisory role, which entails changes to its governance. The amendments to Regulations (EU) 1095/2010, 2015/2365, 2019/1156, 2021/23,  2022/858, 2023/1114, (EU) No 1060/2009, 2016/1011, 2017/2402, 2023/2631, 2024/3005 should therefore start to apply from 12 months after the entry into force of this Regulation. However, to enable the Executive Board to be operational and to effectively take over the tasks assigned to it, the selection and appointment procedure for the members of the Executive Board should start to apply as from the date of entry into force of this Regulation .  (105) To ensure consistency with the amendments to Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010, the amendments to Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 should apply 12 months after the entry into force of this Regulation. However, to enable ESMA to start assessing whether a CCP is a significant CCP before the obligations on significant CCPs start to apply, the provisions that relate to that assessment should start to apply from the date of entry into force of this Regulation. To allow ESMA to gradually phase in the new supervisory responsibilities and to establish the necessary capacity and frameworks of cooperation, the amendments to Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 that relate to the supervision of significant CSDs should apply 24 months after the entry into force of this Regulation. However, to enable ESMA to start assessing whether a CSD is a significant CSD before the obligations on significant CSDs start to apply, the provisions that relate to that assessment should apply from the date of entry into force of this Regulation.  (106) To ensure legal certainty and to avoid disruptions to the establishment of the consolidated tape for shares and ETFs by the first CTP authorised in accordance with Article 27db of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, the amendments to that Regulation that relate to the consolidated tape for shares and ETFs should apply from [ OP insert date =  the day following the expiry of the first period of 5 years referred to in Article 27da of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 with respect to the CTP for shares and ETFs ]. To ensure consistency with the amendments to Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010, the amendments to Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 that relate to ESMA’s powers should start to apply 12 months after the entry into force of this Regulation. To allow for sufficient time to prepare the transfer from national competent authorities to ESMA of competences and duties with respect to the relevant trading venues, ESMA should become the competent authority for the entities concerned 24 months after the entry into force of this Regulation.  (107) The Regulation introduces binding requirements for cross-border digital public services within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2024/903. An interoperability assessment has therefore been completed. The Digital Dimensions chapter of the Legislative Financial and Digital Statement constitutes the resulting report. This will also be published on the Interoperable Europe Portal following the Act's adoption.  (108) The European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with Article 42(1) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council 29 and delivered an opinion on [ XX ].

Any system that falls within the definition of regulated market shall obtain an authorisation before commencing its activities from the competent authority of the Member State where it is situated or operated, or ESMA in the cases referred to in Article 38fa.  2. A regulated market shall be authorised by the competent authority where:  (a) both the market operator and the regulated market that the market operator intends to operate comply with the requirements laid down in this Chapter ;  (b) the market operator is a legal person established in the Union.  3. The market operator shall perform tasks relating to the organisation and operation of the regulated market under the supervision of the competent authority of the Member State where the regulated market is situated or operated, or ESMA in the cases referred to in Article 38fa, and, where expressly provided for by this Regulation, of the national surveillance authority. The market operator may perform ancillary activities that are linked to the operation of a regulated market.  Member States shall not impose any additional requirements on the authorisation and operation of regulated markets than those set out in this Regulation.  4. The market operator shall be responsible for ensuring that it and the regulated market that it operates comply at all times with the requirements laid down in this Regulation.  5. The market operator shall be entitled to exercise the rights that correspond to the regulated market that it operates by virtue of this Regulation.  6. A market operator shall, without undue delay, inform the competent authority of any substantive changes affecting the compliance with the conditions for authorisation laid down in this Chapter.  7. Without prejudice to any relevant provisions of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 or of Directive 2014/57/EU, the public law governing the trading conducted under the systems of the regulated market shall be that of the Member State where the regulated market is situated or operated.  Article 2b Procedures for granting and refusing applications for authorisation of regulated markets  1. The applicant market operator shall submit an application providing all information necessary to enable the competent authority to confirm that the market operator has put in place, at the time of initial authorisation of the regulated market, all the necessary arrangements to ensure that both the market operator and the systems of the regulated market that the market operator intends to operate meet the requirements laid down in this Chapter, including a programme of operations setting out, inter alia, the types of services envisaged and the organisational structure.  2. The competent authority shall assess whether the application for authorisation is complete within 20 working days of receipt of the application.  Where the application is not complete, the competent authority shall inform in writing the applicant of the additional information to be provided and set a deadline by which the market operator is to provide additional information.  After assessing the application as complete, the competent authority shall notify the market operator accordingly.  3. The competent authority shall, within six months of receipt of a complete application, assess the compliance with this Chapter of the market operator and of the systems of the regulated market that the market operator intends to operate. It shall adopt a reasoned decision granting or refusing authorisation and shall notify the applicant market operator accordingly within five working days of adoption. It shall also notify the national surveillance authority.  Article 2c Withdrawal of authorisation  1. The competent authority may withdraw the authorisation issued to a regulated market, where it:  (a) does not make use of the authorisation within 12 months, expressly renounces the authorisation or has not operated for the preceding six months;  (a) has obtained the authorisation by making false statements or by any other irregular means;  (b) no longer meets the conditions under which authorisation was granted;  (c) has seriously and systematically infringed this Regulation.  2. Where ESMA is the competent authority, it shall, without undue delay, notify the national surveillance authority of a decision to withdraw the authorisation of a regulated market.  Article 2d Requirements for the management body of a market operator  1. All members of the management body of a market operator shall at all times be of sufficiently good repute, possess sufficient knowledge, skills and experience to perform their duties. The overall composition of the management body shall reflect an adequately broad range of experience.  2. Members of the management body shall fulfil the following requirements:  (a) all members of the management body shall commit sufficient time to perform their functions in the market operator. The number of directorships a member of the management body can hold, in any legal entity, at the same time shall take into account individual circumstances and the nature, scale and complexity of the market operator’s activities.  Unless representing the Member State in which the market operator is established, members of the management body of market operators that are significant in terms of their size, internal organisation and the nature, the scope and the complexity of their activities shall not at the same time hold positions exceeding more than one of the following combinations:  (i) one executive directorship with two non-executive directorships;  (ii) four non-executive directorships.  Executive or non-executive directorships held within the same group or undertakings where the market operator owns a qualifying holding shall be considered to be one single directorship.  The competent authority may authorise members of the management body to hold one additional non-executive directorship. Where ESMA is not the competent authority, competent authorities shall regularly inform ESMA of such authorisations.  Directorships in organisations which do not pursue predominantly commercial objectives shall be exempt from the limitation on the number of directorships a member of a management body can hold.  (b) The management body shall possess adequate collective knowledge, skills and experience to be able to understand the market operator’s activities, including the main risks.  (c) Each member of the management body shall act with honesty, integrity and independence of mind to effectively assess and challenge the decisions of the senior management where necessary and to effectively oversee and monitor decision-making.  3. Market operators shall devote adequate human and financial resources to the induction and training of members of the management body.  4. Where, under national law, the management body has competence in the process of selection and appointment of any of its members, the competent authority shall assess whether, taking into account the size and the internal organisation of the market operator, as well as the nature, scope and complexity of its activities, the market operator shall establish a nomination committee composed of members of the management body who do not perform any executive function in the market operator concerned.  Where established, the nomination committee shall carry out the following:  (a) identify and recommend, for the approval of the management body or for approval of the general meeting, candidates to fill management body vacancies. In doing so, the nomination committee shall evaluate the balance of knowledge, skills, diversity and experience of the management body. Further, the committee shall prepare a description of the roles and capabilities for a particular appointment, and assess the time commitment expected. Furthermore, the nomination committee shall decide on a target for the representation of the underrepresented gender in the management body and prepare a policy on how to increase the number of the underrepresented gender in the management body in order to meet that target;  (b) periodically, and at least annually, assess the structure, size, composition and performance of the management body, and make recommendations to the management body with regard to any changes;  (c) periodically, and at least annually, assess the knowledge, skills and experience of individual members of the management body and of the management body collectively, and report to the management body accordingly;  (d) periodically review the policy of the management body for selection and appointment of senior management and make recommendations to the management body.  In performing its duties, the nomination committee shall, to the extent possible and on an ongoing basis, take account of the need to ensure that the management body’s decision making is not dominated by any one individual or small group of individuals in a manner that is detrimental to the interests of the market operator as a whole.  In performing its duties, the nomination committee shall be able to use any forms of resources it deems appropriate, including external advice.  5. Market operators and their respective nomination committees shall engage a broad set of qualities and competences when recruiting members to the management body and, for that purpose, shall put in place a policy promoting diversity on the management body.  6. The management body of a market operator shall define and oversee the implementation of the governance arrangements that ensure effective and prudent management of an organisation, including the segregation of duties in the organisation and the prevention of conflicts of interest, and in a manner that promotes the integrity of the market.  The management body shall monitor and periodically assess the effectiveness of the market operator’s governance arrangements and take appropriate steps to address any deficiencies.  Members of the management body shall have adequate access to information and documents which are needed to oversee and monitor management decision-making.  7. The competent authority shall refuse authorisation where it is not satisfied that the members of the management body of the market operator are of sufficiently good repute, possess sufficient knowledge, skills and experience and commit sufficient time to perform their functions, or where there are objective and demonstrable grounds for believing that the management body of the market operator may pose a threat to its effective, sound and prudent management and to the adequate consideration of the integrity of the market.  In the process of authorisation of a regulated market, the person or persons who effectively direct the business and the operations of another regulated market already authorised in the Union are deemed to comply with the requirements laid down in paragraph 1.  Where the conduct of a member of the management body of a market operator is likely to be prejudicial to its effective, sound and prudent management and to the adequate consideration of the integrity of the market, the competent authority shall take appropriate measures, which may include removing that member from the management body.  8. A market operator shall notify the competent authority of the names of all members of its management body and of any changes to its membership, along with all information needed to assess whether the market operator complies with paragraphs 1 to 6.  9. ESMA shall issue guidelines on the following:  (a) the notion of sufficient time commitment of a member of the management body to perform that member’s functions, in relation to the individual circumstances and the nature, scale and complexity of activities of the market operator;  (b) the notion of adequate collective knowledge, skills and experience of the management body as referred to in paragraph 2, point (b);  (c) the notions of honesty, integrity and independence of mind of a member of the management body as referred to in paragraph 2, point (c);  (d) the notion of adequate human and financial resources devoted to the induction and training of members of the management body as referred to in paragraph 3;  (e) the notion of diversity to be taken into account for the selection of members of the management body as referred to in paragraph 5.  Article 2e  Requirements relating to persons exercising significant influence over the management of the regulated market  1. The persons who are in a position to exercise, directly or indirectly, significant influence over the management of the regulated market shall be suitable.  2.  The market operator of the regulated market shall:  (a) provide the competent authority with, and make public, information regarding the ownership of market operator, and, where relevant, for regulated markets authorised pursuant to Directive 2014/65/EU as applicable before [OP: please insert date of entry into application of this Regulation], the ownership of the regulated market , and in particular, the identity and scale of interests of any parties in a position to exercise significant influence over the management;  (b) inform the competent authority of and make public any transfer of ownership which gives rise to a change in the identity of the persons exercising significant influence over the operation of the regulated market.  3. The competent authority shall refuse to approve proposed changes to the controlling interests of the market operator and, where relevant, of the regulated market, where there are objective and demonstrable grounds for believing that they would pose a threat to the sound and prudent management of the regulated market.  If changes to the controlling interests of the market operator and, where relevant, of the regulated market, take place despite the opposition of the competent authority, that competent authority shall be able to order the annulment of the corresponding votes cast.  4. Where the persons referred to in paragraph 1 exercise an influence which is likely to be prejudicial to the sound and prudent management of a regulated market, the competent authority shall take appropriate measures to put an end to that situation. Such measures may include applications for judicial orders, the imposition of sanctions against directors and those responsible for management, and the suspension of the exercise of the voting rights attached to the shares held by the shareholders or members in question.  5. Member States shall not impose any additional requirements for transfers of ownership which give rise to changes to the controlling interests of the market operator and, where relevant, of the regulated market.  Article 2 f Organisational requirements  1. Market operators shall ensure that a regulated market that they operate:  (a) has arrangements to identify clearly and manage the potential adverse consequences, for the operation of the regulated market or for its members or participants, of any conflict of interest between the interest of the regulated market, the market operator and its owners, and the sound functioning of the regulated market, and in particular where such conflicts of interest might prove prejudicial to the accomplishment of any functions delegated to the regulated market by the competent authority;  (b) is adequately equipped to manage the risks to which it is exposed, including to manage ICT risk in accordance with Chapter II of Regulation (EU) 2022/2554, to implement appropriate arrangements and systems for identifying significant risks to its operation, and to put in place effective measures to mitigate those risks;  (c) has transparent and non-discretionary rules and procedures that provide for fair and orderly trading and establish objective criteria for the efficient execution of orders;  (d) has effective arrangements to facilitate the efficient and timely finalisation of the transactions executed under its systems;  (e) has available, at the time of authorisation and on an ongoing basis, sufficient financial resources to facilitate its orderly functioning, having regard to the nature and extent of the transactions concluded on the market and the range and degree of the risks to which it is exposed;  (f) has arrangements in place to ensure that it meets data quality standards pursuant to Article 22b;  (g) has at least three materially active members or users, each having the opportunity to interact with all the others in respect of price formation.  Where, for the purposes of compliance with the requirements under the first subparagraph, points (a), (b), (d), and (f), a market operator deploys resources of or relies on the performance of functions by another entity located in the Union that belongs to the same group as that market operator, reliance on that entity shall not constitute outsourcing for the purposes of this Regulation, provided that the conditions set out in paragraph 1a are met. The location within the Union of the entity that deploys resources or performs functions for the compliance by a market operator with the requirements referred to in the first subparagraph, points (a), (b), (d), and (f), shall not be relevant in the assessment of that compliance by the competent authority.  1a. The reliance of a market operator on another entity located in the Union and that belongs to the same group as that market operator shall not constitute outsourcing pursuant to paragraph 1, provided that the following conditions are fulfilled:  (a) the market operator and another entity in the group that will deploy its resources or will perform functions for that regulated market have put in place arrangements to ensure that that entity within the same group cooperates with the competent authority and, where relevant, the national surveillance authority of the regulated market in connection with that deployment of resources or with that performance of functions;  (b) the market operator has put in place adequate mechanisms to identify clearly and manage the potential adverse consequences, for the operation of the regulated market or for its members or participants, of any conflict of interest between the regulated market, the market operator and another entity in the group that will deploy its resources or will perform functions for that regulated market.  When deploying resources of or relying on the performance of functions by another entity within the same group, market operators shall remain fully responsible for discharging all of their obligations under this Regulation and under Directive 2014/65/EU.

The market operator of the regulated market shall monitor and enforce compliance by investment firms with the requirements of such binding written agreements. The market operator of the regulated market shall inform the competent authority about the content of the binding written agreement and shall, upon request, provide all further information to the competent authority necessary to enable the competent authority to satisfy itself of compliance by the regulated market with this paragraph. Where ESMA is the competent authority, the national surveillance authority may request ESMA to share the content of the binding written agreements relevant to the supervisory activity of that national surveillance authority.  4.

Where the competent authority is not ESMA, the competent authority shall report those parameters to ESMA. Where a regulated market which is material in terms of liquidity in that financial instrument halts trading, in any Member State, the market operator of that regulated market shall ensure that the regulated market has the necessary systems and procedures in place to notify its competent authority, its national surveillance authority and ESMA, where ESMA is not its competent authority. The competent authority and, where ESMA is the competent authority, the national surveillance authority shall then notify all other competent authorities and, where relevant, national surveillance authorities in the Union in order for them to coordinate a market-wide response and determine whether it is appropriate to halt trading on other venues on which the financial instrument is traded until trading resumes on the original market.  The market operator of a regulated market shall ensure that the regulated market discloses publicly on its website information about the circumstances leading to the halting or constraining of trading and on the principles for establishing the main technical parameters used to do so.  Where a regulated market does not halt or constrain trading as referred to in the first subparagraph, despite the fact that a significant price movement in a financial instrument or related financial instruments has led to disorderly trading conditions on one or several markets, the competent authority or, where ESMA is the competent authority, the national surveillance authority shall be able to take appropriate measures to re-establish the normal functioning of the markets, including using the supervisory powers referred to in Article 69(2), points (m) to (p) of Directive 2014/65/EU. The national surveillance authority shall notify ESMA of the measures taken without undue delay.  6. The market operator of a regulated market shall ensure that the regulated market has in place effective systems, procedures and arrangements, including requiring members or participants to carry out appropriate testing of algorithms and providing environments to facilitate such testing in accordance with the requirements laid down in Chapters II and IV of Regulation (EU) 2022/2554, to ensure that algorithmic trading systems cannot create or contribute to disorderly trading conditions on the market and to manage any disorderly trading conditions which do arise from such algorithmic trading systems, including systems to limit the ratio of unexecuted orders to transactions that may be entered into the system by a member or participant, to be able to slow down the flow of orders if there is a risk of its system capacity being reached and to limit and enforce the minimum tick size that may be executed on the market.  7. The market operator of a regulated market that permits direct electronic access shall ensure that the regulated market has in place effective systems procedures and arrangements to ensure that members or participants are only permitted to provide direct electronic access if they are investment firms authorised under Directive 2014/65/EU or credit institutions authorised under Directive 2013/36/EU, that appropriate criteria are set and applied regarding the suitability of persons to whom such access may be provided and that the member or participant retains responsibility for orders and trades executed using that service in relation to the requirements of this Regulation.  The market operator of a regulated market shall ensure that the regulated market sets appropriate standards regarding risk controls and thresholds on trading through such access and shall be able to distinguish and if necessary to stop orders or trading by a person using direct electronic access separately from other orders or trading by the member or participant.  The market operator of a regulated market shall ensure that the regulated market has arrangements in place to suspend or terminate the provision of direct electronic access by a member or participant to a client in the case of non-compliance with this paragraph.  8. The market operator of a regulated market shall ensure that the rules of the regulated market on co-location services are transparent, fair and non-discriminatory.  9. The market operator of a regulated market shall ensure that the regulated market has fee structures including execution fees, ancillary fees and any rebates that are transparent, fair and non-discriminatory and that they do not create incentives to place, modify or cancel orders or to execute transactions in a way which contributes to disorderly trading conditions or market abuse. In particular, the market operator of a regulated market shall ensure that the regulated market imposes market making obligations in individual shares or a suitable basket of shares in exchange for any rebates that are granted.  A regulated market may adjust its fees for cancelled orders according to the length of time for which the order was maintained and calibrate the fees to each financial instrument to which they apply.  A regulated market may impose a higher fee for placing an order that is subsequently cancelled than an order which is executed and impose a higher fee on participants placing a high ratio of cancelled orders to executed orders and on those operating a high-frequency algorithmic trading technique in order to reflect the additional burden on system capacity.  10. The market operator of a regulated market shall ensure that the regulated market be able to identify, by means of flagging from members or participants, orders generated by algorithmic trading, the different algorithms used for the creation of orders and the relevant persons initiating those orders. That information shall be available upon request to competent authorities and, where ESMA is the competent authority, to national surveillance authorities  The market operator of a regulated market shall ensure that the regulated market makes available to the competent authority or, where ESMA is the competent authority, to the national surveillance authority data relating to the order book or give the competent authority or, where relevant to the national surveillance authority access to the order book, upon request, so that it is able to monitor trading. The national surveillance authority shall, in turn, report that data to ESMA, upon request.  Article 2 h Tick sizes  1. The market operator of a regulated market shall ensure that the regulated market adopts tick‐size regimes in shares, depositary receipts, exchange‐traded funds, certificates and other similar financial instruments and in any other financial instrument for which regulatory technical standards are developed in accordance with Article 2zg(3), point (k). The application of tick sizes shall not prevent regulated markets from matching orders large in scale at mid‐point within the current bid and offer prices.  2. The tick size regimes referred to in paragraph 1 shall:  (a) be calibrated to reflect the liquidity profile of the financial instrument in different markets and the average bid-ask spread, taking into account the desirability of enabling reasonably stable prices without unduly constraining further narrowing of spreads;  (b) adapt the tick size for each financial instrument appropriately.  In respect of shares with an International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) issued outside the European Economic Area (EEA), or shares which have an EEA ISIN and which are traded on a third-country venue in the local currency or in a non-EEA currency, as referred to in Article 23(1), point (a), for which the venue that is the most relevant market in terms of liquidity is in a third country, regulated markets may provide for the same tick size that applies on that venue.  Article 2 i Admission of financial instruments to trading  1. The market operator of a regulated market shall ensure that the regulated market has clear and transparent rules regarding the admission of financial instruments to trading.  Those rules shall ensure that any financial instruments admitted to trading on a regulated market are capable of being traded in a fair, orderly and efficient manner and, in the case of transferable securities, are freely negotiable.  Member States shall not restrict the scope of financial instruments that can be admitted to trading on a regulated market on the ground that such instruments shall not be made available to non-professional investors in their jurisdiction.  2. In the case of derivatives, the rules referred to in paragraph 1 shall ensure in particular that the design of the derivative contract allows for its orderly pricing as well as for the existence of effective settlement conditions.  3. In addition to the obligations set out in paragraphs 1 and 2, the market operator of a regulated market shall ensure that the regulated market establishes and maintains effective arrangements to verify that issuers of transferable securities that are admitted to trading on the regulated market comply with their obligations under Union law in respect of initial, ongoing or ad hoc disclosure obligations.  The market operator of a regulated market shall ensure that the regulated market establishes arrangements which facilitate their members or participants in obtaining access to information which has been made public under Union law.  4. The market operator of a regulated market shall ensure that the regulated market establishes the necessary arrangements to review regularly the compliance with the admission requirements of the financial instruments which it admits to trading.  5. A transferable security that has been admitted to trading on a regulated market can subsequently be admitted to trading on other regulated markets, even without the consent of the issuer and in compliance with the relevant provisions of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129. The issuer shall be informed by the regulated market of the fact that its securities are traded on that regulated market. The issuer shall not be subject to any obligation to provide information required under paragraph 3 directly to any regulated market which has admitted the issuer’s securities to trading without its consent.  Article 2 j Specific conditions for the admission to trading of shares  1. The market operator of a regulated market shall ensure that the regulated market requires that the foreseeable market capitalisation of the company for whose shares admission to trading is sought, or if that cannot be assessed, that company’s capital and reserves, including profit and loss, from the last financial year, shall be at least EUR 1 000 000 or an equivalent amount in a national currency other than the euro.  2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply to the admission to trading of shares fungible with shares already admitted to trading.  3. Where, as a result of an adjustment of the equivalent amount in a national currency other than the euro, the market capitalisation expressed in the national currency remains for a period of one year at least 10 % more, or at least 10 % less, than EUR 1 000 000, the market operator shall, within the 12 months following the expiry of that period, ensure that the regulated market adjusts its rules to comply with paragraph 1.  4. The market operator of a regulated market shall ensure that the regulated market requires that at least 10 % of the subscribed capital represented by the class of shares concerned by the application for admission to trading is held by the public at the time of admission to trading.  5. By way of derogation from paragraph 4, Member States may require that regulated markets establish, at the time of admission, at least one of the following requirements for an application for admission to trading of shares:  (a) a sufficient number of shares is held by the public;  (b) the shares are held by a sufficient number of shareholders;  (c) the market value of the shares held by the public represents a sufficient level of subscribed capital in the class of shares concerned.  6. Where admission to trading is sought for shares fungible with shares already admitted to trading, regulated markets shall assess, to fulfil the requirement laid down in paragraph 4, whether a sufficient number of shares has been distributed to the public in relation to all shares issued and not only in relation to the shares fungible with shares already admitted to trading.  Article 2 k Suspension and removal of financial instruments from trading on a regulated market  1. Without prejudice to the right of the competent authority or, where ESMA is the competent authority, the national surveillance authority under Article 69(2) of Directive 2014/65/EU to demand suspension or removal of a financial instrument from trading, a market operator may suspend or remove from trading a financial instrument which no longer complies with the rules of the regulated market unless such suspension or removal would be likely to cause significant damage to the investors’ interests or the orderly functioning of the market.  2. A market operator that suspends or removes from trading a financial instrument shall also suspend or remove the derivatives as referred to in points (4) to (10) of Section C of Annex I to Directive 2014/65/EC that relate or are referenced to that financial instrument where necessary to support the objectives of the suspension or removal of the underlying financial instrument. The market operator shall make public the suspension or removal of the financial instrument and of any related derivative and communicate it to its competent authority and, where ESMA is the competent authority, its national surveillance authority.  Market operators operating other regulated markets, and market operators and investment firms operating MTFs, OTFs and systematic internalisers, which trade the same financial instrument as referred to in paragraph 1 or derivatives as referred to in points (4) to (10) of Section C of Annex I to Directive 2014/65/EC that relate or are referenced to the financial instrument referred to in paragraph 1, shall upon gaining knowledge of such suspension or removal and without undue delay also suspend or remove that financial instrument or derivatives from trading, where the suspension or removal is due to suspected market abuse, a take-over bid or the non-disclosure of inside information about the issuer or financial instrument infringing Articles 7 and 17 of Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014, unless the competent authority or, where ESMA is the competent authority, the national surveillance authority deems that the suspension or removal could cause significant damage to the investors’ interests or the orderly functioning of the market.  The market operators, investment firms and systematic internalisers referred to in the previous subparagraph shall make public the suspension or removal of the financial instrument and of any related derivative. This paragraph applies also when the suspension from trading of a financial instrument or derivatives as referred to in points (4) to (10) of Section C of Annex I to Directive 2014/65/EC that relate or are referenced to that financial instrument is lifted.  This paragraph shall also apply in the case where the decision to suspend or remove from trading a financial instrument or derivatives as referred to in points (4) to (10) of Section C of Annex I to Directive 2014/65/EC that relate or are referenced to that financial instrument is taken by the competent authority or, where ESMA is the competent authority, the national surveillance authority pursuant to Article 69(2), points (m) and (n), of Directive 2014/65/EU.  Article 2 l Access to a regulated market  1. The market operator of a regulated market shall ensure that the regulated market establishes, implements and maintains transparent and non-discriminatory rules, based on objective criteria, governing access to or membership of the regulated market.  2. The rules referred to in paragraph 1 shall specify any obligations for the members or participants arising from:  (a) the constitution and administration of the regulated market;  (b) rules relating to transactions on the market;  (c) professional standards imposed on the staff of the investment firms or credit institutions that are operating on the market;  (d) the conditions established, for members or participants other than investment firms and credit institutions, under paragraph 3 ;  (e) the rules and procedures for the clearing and settlement of transactions concluded on the regulated market.  3. Regulated markets may admit as members or participants investment firms, credit institutions authorised under Directive 2013/36/EU, and other persons who:  (a) are of sufficient good repute;  (b) have a sufficient level of trading ability, competence and experience;  (c) have, where applicable, adequate organisational arrangements;  (d) have sufficient resources for the role they are to perform, taking into account the different financial arrangements that the regulated market may have established in order to guarantee the adequate settlement of transactions.  3a. When admitting as members or participants persons that are already members or participants of another regulated market, regulated markets shall deem that those persons comply with paragraph 3, point (a), without any further assessment. Regulated markets shall also deem that those persons comply with paragraph 2, point (c), or paragraph 3, points (b) and (c), as applicable, without any further assessment, where they request to become members or participants with respect to trading in a class of financial instruments for which they are already members or participants of another regulated market.  4. For the transactions concluded on a regulated market, members and participants are not obliged to apply to each other the obligations laid down in Articles 24, 25, 27 and 28 of Directive 2014/65/EU. However, the members or participants of the regulated market shall apply the obligations provided for in Articles 24, 25, 27 and 28 of Directive 2014/65/EU with respect to their clients when they, acting on behalf of their clients, execute their orders on a regulated market.  5. The rules on access to or membership of or participation in a regulated market shall provide for the direct or remote participation of investment firms and credit institutions. Those rules shall not discriminate between direct or remote participation or impose any additional restrictions on either form of participation.  6. Market operators shall communicate, on a regular basis, to the competent authority and, where ESMA is the competent authority, to the national surveillance authority, the list of the members or participants of the regulated markets they operate.  Article 2 m Notification of amendments to the rules of the regulated market  1. A market operator shall notify the competent authority of any amendment to the rules of the regulated market it operates at least 30 days before that amendment takes effect.  2. The competent authority shall have the power to require a market operator to amend the rules of the regulated market it operates where it finds that those rules do not comply with the requirements under this Regulation.  Article 2 n Monitoring of compliance with the rules of the regulated market and with other legal obligations  1. The market operator of a regulated market shall ensure that the regulated market establishes and maintains effective arrangements and procedures including the necessary resources for the regular monitoring of the compliance by their members or participants with their rules. Regulated markets shall monitor orders sent including cancellations and the transactions undertaken by their members or participants under their systems in order to identify infringements of those rules, disorderly trading conditions or conduct that may indicate behaviour that is prohibited under Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 or system disruptions in relation to a financial instrument and shall deploy the resources necessary to ensure that such monitoring is effective.  2. The market operator of a regulated market shall immediately inform its competent authority and, where ESMA is the competent authority, the national surveillance authority, of significant infringements of their rules or disorderly trading conditions or conduct that may indicate behaviour that is prohibited under Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 or system disruptions in relation to a financial instrument.  The competent authority or, where ESMA is the competent authority, the national surveillance authority shall communicate the information referred to in the first subparagraph to ESMA and to the authorities designated in accordance with Article 67(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU of the other Member States.  In relation to conduct that may indicate behaviour that is prohibited under Regulation (EU) No 596/2014, the competent authority or, where ESMA is the competent authority, the national surveillance authority shall be convinced that such behaviour is being or has been carried out before it notifies the authorities designated in accordance with Article 67(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU of the other Member States.  Where ESMA is the competent authority, ESMA shall take due consideration of the information received pursuant to this paragraph, in particular when assessing a potential infringement of paragraph 1 by the regulated market. ESMA may require the national surveillance authority to submit any additional information necessary for the purpose of this assessment.  Where ESMA is the competent authority, in cases where a national surveillance authority considers that the information referred to in this paragraph has not been provided or has not been provided in a timely manner by the market operator, that authority shall inform ESMA. ESMA shall assess, within 20 working days, whether the market operator has breached its obligations under the first subparagraph, and take the appropriate measures.  3. The market operator shall supply the relevant information without undue delay to the authority competent for the investigation and prosecution of market abuse on the regulated market and provide full assistance to the latter in investigating and prosecuting market abuse occurring on or through the systems of the regulated market.  Where ESMA is the competent authority of the regulated market, in cases where an authority competent for the investigation and prosecution of market abuse on such a regulated market considers that the information or the assistance referred to in this paragraph has not been provided or has not been provided in a timely manner, that authority shall inform ESMA. ESMA shall assess, within 20 working days, whether the market operator has breached its obligations under the first subparagraph, and take the appropriate measures.  Article 2o Cross-border activity of regulated markets  1. An authorised regulated market may freely perform its activity within the Union, through the freedom to provide services or through setting up a branch. Those activities shall include at least:  (a) the provision of appropriate arrangements so as to facilitate access to and trading on that regulated market by remote members or participants established in any Member State;  (b) activities relating to the admission of members or participants on that regulated market;  (c) activities relating to the admission of financial instruments to trading on that regulated market.  2. The market operator of an authorised regulated market, or of a regulated market that has applied for authorisation pursuant to Article 2b that intends to perform its activity within the territory of another Member State, shall ensure that the regulated market communicates to its competent authority the Member State in which it intends to perform its activity. The competent authority shall communicate that information to the authority designated pursuant to Article 67 of Directive 2014/65/EU of the Member State where the regulated market intends to perform its activity, within seven working days. Where ESMA is not the competent authority, ESMA may request access to that information in accordance with the procedure and under the conditions set out in Article 35 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.  The competent authority of the regulated market shall, on the request of the authority designated pursuant to Article 67 of Directive 2014/65/EU of the Member State where the regulated market intends to perform or performs its activity, and, without undue delay, communicate the identity of the members or participants of the regulated market that are established in that Member State.  Where the regulated market sets up a branch, the information referred to in the first subparagraph shall include:  (a) the tasks that will be carried out by the branch;  (b) the organisational structure of the branch;  (c) the address in the Member State where the regulated market intends to set up a branch;  (d) the names of those responsible for the management of the branch.  3. In the event of a change in any of the particulars communicated in accordance with paragraph 2, the market operator of a regulated market shall ensure that the regulated market gives written notice of that change to its competent authority at least seven working days before implementing the change. That competent authority shall notify that change to the authority designated pursuant to Article 67 of Directive 2014/65/EU of the Member State where the regulated market performs its activity.  4. Member States shall not impose any further legal or administrative requirements in relation to the cross-border activity of regulated markets in their territory.  CHAPTER 2 Requirements for MTFs and OTFs  Article 2p Requirement for authorisation for MTFs and OTFs operated by a market operator  A competent authority shall authorise a market operator to operate an MTF or OTF subject to the prior verification of its compliance with the provisions set out in this Chapter.  Article 2q Authorisation, ongoing supervision and withdrawal of authorisation of investment firms to operate MTFs or OTFs  1. Where ESMA is the competent authority pursuant to Article 38fa for an investment firm or a market operator operating a significant trading venue, and where an applicant investment firm belongs to the same group as that investment firm or that market operator operating a significant trading venue, ESMA shall be empowered to authorise that applicant investment firm where it intends to exclusively perform the operation of an MTF or an OTF, or both.  2. ESMA shall keep under regular review the compliance of the investment firm authorised in accordance with paragraph 1 with the requirements set out in this Regulation and Title II of Directive 2014/65/EU.  3. ESMA may withdraw the authorisation issued to an investment firm in accordance with paragraph 1 where the conditions for withdrawal set out in Article 8 of Directive 2014/65/EU are met.  4. For the purposes of carrying out the tasks conferred on it by this Article, ESMA shall apply the national provisions transposing Directive 2014/65/EU of the home Member State of that investment firm, interpreted in a manner consistent with Union law.  5.

After assessing the application as complete, ESMA shall notify the investment firm accordingly.  ESMA shall, within 60 working days of receipt of the complete application, issue an opinion on the authorisation to operate an MTF or OTF and transmit that opinion without undue delay to the competent authority of the home Member State.  The competent authority of the home Member State shall adopt a reasoned decision granting or refusing the authorisation on the basis of the opinion transmitted by ESMA and shall notify the investment firm accordingly within five working days of adoption. The competent authority shall refuse the authorisation to operate an MTF or OTF where ESMA gives a negative opinion.  6. The competent authority of the home Member State may withdraw the authorisation referred to in the previous paragraph, where ESMA notifies it that any of the conditions set out in Article 8 of Directive 2014/65/EU is met in relation to the operation of an MTF or an OTF. Where the competent authority withdraws the authorisation, it shall inform the investment firm accordingly.  7.

Where the request referred to in paragraph 1 concerns investment services or activities other than the operation of an MTF or an OTF, ESMA shall without undue delay transmit that request and any information provided by the investment firm for that purpose to the competent authority of the home Member State of the investment firm.  The competent authority referred to in subparagraph 1 shall assess whether the application for authorisation is complete within 10 working days of receipt of the application.  Where the application is not complete, the competent authority shall set a deadline by which the investment firm is to provide additional information.

ESMA shall refuse the extension of the authorisation where the competent authority gives a negative opinion.  3. Without prejudice to Article 2q(3), ESMA shall withdraw the authorisation referred to in Article 2q in relation to services or activities referred to in paragraph 1, where the competent authority of the home Member State of the investment firm provides a reasoned opinion concluding that any of the conditions set out in Article 8 of Directive 2014/65/EU is met in relation to the investment services or activities referred to in paragraph 1. Where ESMA withdraws the authorisation, it shall inform the investment firm accordingly.  4.

Paragraphs 1 to 3 shall apply as of when ESMA becomes the competent authority pursuant to Article 38fa.  Article 2u C ompliance with the rules of the MTF or the OTF and with other legal obligations  1.

The supervisory transition plan shall include all transitional arrangements necessary for the smooth and orderly transfer of competences and duties between ESMA and national surveillance authorities as well as an effective date, by which the transfer of such competences and duties shall apply.

FRAMEWORK OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE  1.1. Title of the proposal/initiative  This legislative financial and digital statement covers the following proposals:  - proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulations (EU) 1095/2010, 648/2012, 600/2014, 909/2014, 2019/1156, 2022/858 and 2023/1114 as regards the further development of market integration and supervision within the Union (‘Master Regulation’)  - proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directives (EU) 2009/65/EC, 2011/61/EU and 2014/65/EU as regards the further development of market integration and supervision within the Union (‘Master Directive’)  1.2. Policy area(s) concerned  Internal market – financial services  1.3. Objective(s)  1.3.1. General objective(s)  The general objectives of the initiative are to improve the functioning of the single market in financial services by addressing persistent fragmentation both within and across relevant sectors (trading, post trading, asset management and crypto asset services). The proposed changes aim to foster stronger market integration and enable efficiency gains by removing obstacles to cross-border activity and strengthening regulatory and supervisory convergence as well as supervisory capacity in the relevant sectors.  This package of measures addresses two core pillars of the Commission’s Savings and Investment Union (SIU) strategy: ‘integration and scale’, and ‘efficient supervision in the single market’. It has a very broad scope and encompasses key sectors that form the backbone of capital markets, providing essential infrastructure for offering and investing in financial instruments and assets, and enabling crucial intermediation between investors and entities seeking financing.  1.3.2. Specific objective(s)  The specific objectives of this initiative are as follows:  • Enable further market integration and scale effects by increasing cross-border activity – the initiative aims to improve the ability of market actors to operate seamlessly across Member States, thereby increasing market integration. This in turn should drive both consolidation and specialisation within the individual sectors.  • Improve supervision by reducing fragmentation – the initiative seeks to address shortcomings and inefficiencies in the current supervisory framework, by tackling inconsistencies and complexities arising from fragmented national supervisory approaches. It aims to make supervision more effective, more conducive to cross-border activities, and more responsive to emerging risks, while reducing unnecessary burdens on firms. This should also increase investor confidence. Strengthening supervisory powers and capacities at the EU level, including by transferring more direct supervisory responsibilities to ESMA, aims to leverage the mutually reinforcing relationship between market integration and supervisory alignment.  • Facilitate innovation by removing regulatory obstacles – the initiative aims to remove regulatory obstacles to innovation with the aim of creating a framework which enables new technologies in the provision of financial services. For innovation to thrive, both the DLT Pilot Regime (DLTPR) and the standard rulebook should allow the industry to use distributed ledger technology (DLT) to bring efficient solutions to the market while ensuring that associated risks are mitigated.  The specific objectives will be pursued without compromising financial stability, market integrity or investor protection, thereby ensuring that the EU financial market remains safe and globally attractive.  1.3.3. Expected result(s) and impact  Specify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.  This initiative affects in particular the following groups of stakeholders: trading venues, investment firms (notably brokers), central securities depositories (CSDs), central counterparties (CCPs), asset managers, crypto asset service providers (CASPs), DLT-based structures, investors (including retail end-investors), national competent authorities (NCAs), the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the European Central Bank (ECB).  In terms of benefits, trading venues and investment firms would benefit from rationalisation of intra-group operations, cross-border operations and savings linked to local governance costs. Operational efficiency gains for exchange operators should be partially passed on to downstream intermediaries and retail and institutional investors. CSDs would benefit from facilitation of cross-border provision of services and from increased legal clarity and certainty. Moreover, costs per settlement transaction could be reduced by a greater use of TARGET2-Securities (T2S). CSDs, investment firms, CASPS, credit institutions using DLT-based structures would also benefit from harmonised definitions and concepts. Asset managers would benefit from reduced compliance burden and legal costs as well as increased legal clarity when engaging in cross-border activities.  Financial market participants under strengthened EU supervision (i.e. cross-border significant trading venues, CSDs, CCPs, asset management firms and CASPs) would benefit from: 1) reduced compliance cost and administrative burden for entities currently supervised by multiple NCAs; 2) savings stemming from fewer duplications, differences in instructions and procedural delays; 3) reduction of supervisory fees for entities currently supervised by several NCAs and 4) savings due to synergies and increased intra-group outsourcing/delegation.  The initiative is expected to lead to deeper and more integrated financial markets and increased trust in financial markets, benefitting end-users and the wider economy. Institutional and retail investors are expected to face lower trading costs and a larger choice of financial products and services. More agile and comprehensive supervision of capital markets will increase investors’ trust and overall confidence in the governance and supervision of capital markets. This could increase cross-border investments in the single market, yielding benefits for companies via a broader access to funding and expected lower financing costs.  On the cost side, trading venues, brokers, CSDs, asset managers, CASPs and DLT-based structures would face implementation costs to align their operations with legal changes. For instance, CSDs would have to invest in establishing new links with other CSDs, if not yet in place, and to join T2S, if they are not members already. The ECB would likely have to invest into T2S to accommodate a higher number of linked CSDs as well as higher securities settlement volumes, in addition to any other changes to the functionality of the platform. ESMA would have to hire additional staff to perform new tasks (financed through fees) while NCAs would gain room for staff reductions due to centralisation of certain tasks.  1.3.4. Indicators of performance  Specify the indicators for monitoring progress and achievements.  Non-exhaustive list of potential indicators:  Number of Pan-European market operators  Average number of broker-venue connections  Number of instances of a regulated market setting up a branch in another Member State  Number of trading venues that are part of a group that are able to rely on staff/resources of other entities part of the same group which are based in the Union  Number of brokers offering cross-border trading  Average gap in fees charged between domestic and cross-border trading within the EU  Volume of cross-border transactions in the EU  Average transaction costs (per asset class; domestic/cross-border)  Number of open access arrangements / applications under open access provisions  Total cross-border settlement activity (volume/value by instrument)  Total cross-border issuance (value/volume)  Number and types of instances of cross-border provision of services by regulated markets  Number and types of instances of cross-border provision of services by CSDs  Number of instances of a CSD setting up a branch in another Member State  Number of CSDs that are part of a group that engage in intra-group outsourcing of core CSD activities  Number of CSDs experimenting with new technologies  Volume and value of settlement conducted by settlement internalisers  Number of CSDs that designate credit institutions to provide banking-type ancillary services  Volume and value of settlement activity taking place in T2S  Total number of CSD links  Settlement activity (in volume and value terms) executed using novel technologies (increase)  Total amount of cash leg settlement executed with digital forms of money  Number of cross-border funds (marketed cross-border)  Average size of funds  Average management cost of funds (per sector / specialisation)  Creation/cessation of funds (indication of market entry barriers)  Number and average size of asset managers  Number of asset manager groups and number of Member States where they operate  Number of DLT-based authorisations  Number of Member States with legal frameworks to allow DLT-based transfer of ownership  Number of colleges with ESMA participation  Number of joint on-site inspections  Number of peer reviews conducted  Number of obstacles to convergence identified and removed  Number of collaboration platforms  Number of investigations of breach of EU law successfully closed  Number of warnings on manifest breach of the EU law  Number of on-site inspections and dedicated investigations  1.4. The proposal/initiative relates to:   a new action   a new action following a pilot project / preparatory action 44   the extension of an existing action   a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action  1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative  1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative  The initiative is expected to follow a phased implementation. In the short term (within 2 years after adoption), preparatory actions would include the development of secondary legislation, establishment of technical standards, and (within 1 year after the adoption) preparatory measures for supervisory transitions. Two years after the adoption new supervisory structures and processes would become operational, allowing ESMA to assume its expanded responsibilities. Two years after entry into force, new supervisory structures and processes would become operational, allowing ESMA to assume its expanded responsibilities.  1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, great er effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this section 'added value of EU involvement' is the value resulting from EU action, that is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.  Reasons for action at EU level (ex-ante)  The cross-border nature of activities in scope of this initiative and the systemic implications of the related supervisory decisions go beyond the capacity of any single Member States to address identified barriers effectively. Action at EU level is justified as it aims at reducing legal and operational uncertainties for businesses and investors, encouraging cross-border investments, enhancing market efficiency, consistency and coherence across all Member States. It is also justified to ensure consistent supervision, safeguard financial stability, and preserve the integrity of the internal market. Moreover, such EU-level initiatives promote a level playing field and increase the attractiveness and competitiveness of the single market for financial services and their economic efficiency, which can only be achieved through coordinated efforts at EU level. The initiative remains proportionate as it ensures the balance between EU and national competence, with respect to entities and activities with material cross-border relevance and those of primarily domestic importance.  Expected generated EU added value (ex-post)  The initiative would create clear EU-wide benefits by removing barriers to cross-border activity, reducing duplication and compliance costs, and enhancing supervisory consistency. It would enable more integrated and efficient financial markets, lowering operational and governance costs for trading venues, CSDs, asset managers and crypto-asset service providers, while providing end-investors with greater trust, lower trading costs and a wider choice of products. Stronger and more coherent EU-level supervision would reduce fragmentation, improve legal certainty and promote cross-border investment, ultimately supporting companies’ access to finance and the competitiveness of EU capital markets.  1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past  The impact assessment accompanying the legislative proposal has assessed how the existing frameworks have performed and identified a number of shortcomings, in particular with respect to (i) barriers to cross-border operations and innovation, and (ii) non-aligned supervisory practices across Member States and weak tools and powers at EU level to enforce convergence and adopt a comprehensive single market/cross-border supervisory approach.  1.5.4. Compatibility with the multiannual financial framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments  The initiative will require additional resources and infrastructure at ESMA to support expanded direct supervision and coordination roles. Staffing needs are explained in the Appendix.  1.5.5. Assessment of the different available financing options, including scope for redeployment  Additional tasks conferred by the legislators could not be covered by redeployment.  The proposal requires a range of new activities and tasks, for which a high proportion of expenses, including overhead and IT systems, will be funded via fees levied on financial market participants supervised by ESMA. An exception to this is that in the preparatory phase, the EU would entirely finance ESMA for the set-up of its operations, so as to enable it to build the function during this key early phase, where fees cannot – yet – be levied whereas costs are incurred. Concerning IT development costs related to fee-funded activities, these would initially be paid from the EU budget but then recovered over a five-year period via fees. It is anticipated that preparation for supervision will take place from mid-2028 to mid-2029 and IT development costs are spread between 2028/2029 and 2030/31.  Not all new tasks are suitable for fee-based financing. Activities relating to supervisory convergence in the areas where ESMA doesn’t have direct supervisory mandates IT tools for the areas where ESMA doesn’t have direct supervisory mandates and DLT will instead be co-funded by the EU and national competent authorities (NCAs), reflecting their broader, system-wide objectives. Since these functions are designed to promote consistency and cooperation across the supervisory network, they cannot appropriately be financed through fees imposed directly on entities overseen by NCAs.  1.6.

Comments  The initiative requires additional resources both under direct management within Commission departments dealing with financial services, and under indirect management within the ESMA agency.  2. MANAGEMENT MEASURES  2.1. Monitoring and reporting rules  As a decentralised agency, ESMA is subject to the legal and operational requirements of the Union laws in terms of monitoring and reporting rules. In line with already existing arrangements, ESMA prepares regular reports on its activity (including internal reporting to Senior Management, reporting to Boards and the production of the annual report), and is subject to audits by the European Court of Auditors and its own Internal Auditor (the Internal Audit Service of the Commission) on its use of resources and performance. Monitoring and reporting of the actions included in the proposal will comply with the already existing requirements, as well as with any new requirements resulting from this proposal.  2.2. Management and control system(s)  2.2.1. Justification of the budget implementation method(s), the funding implementation mechanism(s), the payment modalities and the control strategy proposed  The tasks will be implemented essentially by ESMA under indirect management, with funding covered by the EU budget co-financed in part via NCAs’ contributions, and by fees levied on supervised entities.  In accordance with Article 30 of its Financial Regulations, ESMA is to implement its budgets in compliance with effective and efficient internal control, which should be based upon best international practices and on the Internal Control Framework laid down by the Commission for its own departments.  In accordance with Article 2 of ESMA’s Financial Regulation, the Executive Director of ESMA is the authorising officer who in accordance with Article 45(1) of that Financial Regulation is ‘ responsible for implementing revenue and expenditure in accordance with the principle of sound financial management, including through ensuring reporting on performance and for ensuring compliance with the requirements of legality and regularity and equal treatment of recipients of Union funds. ’ As specified in Article 45(2) of ESMA’s Financial Regulation it is the duty of the authorising officer to put in place the organisational structure and the internal control systems suited to the performance of their duties.  In accordance with Article 70(5) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 of the European Parliament and of the Council (the Financial Regulation), the Internal Auditor of the Commission is also the Internal Auditor of ESMA. In particular, in accordance with Article 78(3) of the Financial Regulations of ESMA, the Commission’s Internal Auditor (i.e. the Internal Audit Service) is responsible for:  (a) assessing the suitability and effectiveness of internal management systems and the performance of departments in implementing programmes and actions by reference to the risks associated with them;  (b) assessing the efficiency and effectiveness of the internal control and audit systems applicable to each operation for implementation of the budget of the Union body.  These responsibilities of the Internal Audit Service will also extend to the tasks implemented by ESMA in accordance with the proposed legislation.  As well as the work of the Internal Audit Service, ESMA is subject to external audit including by the European Court of Auditors, which in accordance with Article 104 of the Financial Regulations of ESMA, shall each year prepare specific annual reports on ESMA in line with the requirements of Article 287(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  2.2.2. Information concerning the risks identified and the internal control system(s) set up to mitigate them  In accordance with Article 45(2) of ESMA’s Financial Regulation, ESMA’s Executive Director, in their role as ESMA’s authorising officer, is to pay due regard to the risks associated with the management environment and the specific risks associated with the nature of the actions financed when putting in place the internal control systems suited to the performance of the duties of the authorising officer. As indicated in the second sub-paragraph of Article 45(2) of ESMA’s Financial Regulation ‘ The establishment of such structure and systems shall be supported by a comprehensive risk analysis, which takes into account their cost-effectiveness and performance considerations. ’  ESMA closely co-operated with its internal auditor (which is the Internal Audit Service of the Commission) to ensure that the appropriate standards are observed in all areas of the internal control framework. Every year, the European Parliament, following a recommendation from the Council, grants discharge to ESMA for the implementation of its budget. This initiative does not bring about new significant risks that would not be covered by an existing internal control framework.  2.2.3. Estimation and justification of the cost-effectiveness of the controls (ratio between the control costs and the value of the related funds managed), and assessment of the expected levels of risk of error (at payment & at closure)  Internal control systems as provided for in ESMA’s Financial Regulation are already implemented and have not been found by ESMA’s internal auditor not to be cost effective. On the basis of past findings of the European Court of Auditors, the risk of errors is expected to be low.  Historically costs incurred by the Commission for the overall cooperation have been estimated at 0.5% of the annual contributions paid to them. Such costs include, for example but not exclusively, the costs related to the assessment of the annual programming and budget, the participation of DG FISMA's representatives in Management Boards, Boards of Supervisors, internal committees and related preparatory work. The initiative is expected to create additional work for the Commission.  2.3. Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities  For the purpose of combating fraud, corruption and any other illegal activity, the provisions of Regulation (EU, Euratom) N°883/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 September 2013 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) apply to the ESAs without any restriction. The ESMA has a dedicated anti-fraud strategy and resulting action plan. ESMA's actions in the area of anti-fraud should be compliant with its Financial Regulation, OLAF’s fraud prevention policies, the provisions provided by the Commission Anti-Fraud Strategy (COM(2019)196) as well as the Common Approach on EU decentralised agencies (July 2012) and the related roadmap. In addition, the Regulations establishing ESMA as well as the ESMA's Financial Regulations set out the provisions on implementation and control of the ESAs' budgets and applicable financial rules, including those aimed at preventing fraud and irregularities.  3.

They support the creation of data flows between financial market business operators, Member States Competent Authorities and EU institutions. The requirements also promote horizontal data sharing across public administrations, which is a key focus of the European data strategy.  Alignment with the once-only principle  Explanation of how the once-only principle has been considered and how the possibility to reuse existing data has been explored  Table: Row 1 — The initiative promotes a ""collect only once, share many times"" approach, where data is gathered only once and then made available to relevant authorities in Member States and EU institutions. This therefore ensures that the initiator only submits information once and that there is no duplication. The initiative promotes alignment and centralised procedures for the same cross-border services. Amendments to Regulation (EU) 600/2014 (MiFIR) For Article 22b, the quotes generated by systematic internalisers would be submitted once on an ongoing basis, with this information being reused or accessed by users of the consolidates or for regulatory purposes. For Article 25, details of orders in financial instruments are already kept at the disposal of national competent authorities (or future national surveillance authorities). The new requirement will provide ESMA with a possibility to request from national surveillance authorities the already-collected data without creating a new reporting obligation for market participants. For Article 38fd, the data would be submitted once by the applicant (e.g. a trading venue) seeking authorisation from ESMA. That information could then be accessed by the applicant itself, ESMA, the relevant competent authorities or national surveillance authorities, where applicable.  Explanation of how newly created data is findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable, and meets high-quality standards  Table: Row 1 — The initiative promotes collection of data only once which is then shared with relevant competent authorities in MSs and relevant EU institutions via central databases. The requirements promote the transparency and accessibility to information using public registers, publication of reports and disclosures on ESMA web sites. Amendments to Regulation (EU) 600/2014 (MiFIR) For Article 22b and Article 25, there is no newly created data. Such data is already subject to harmonised data formats and in a machine-readable format, thus already ensuring consistency and completeness, which facilitates seamless interoperability and reuse. For Article 38fd, the data will be easily accessible via the central database. It will be stored there, and therefore reusable. Since the format for providing the mandatory data will be harmonised, the data will also be interoperable. Amendments to Regulation (EU) 684/2012 (EMIR) All information, data, communications and requests transmitted under EMIR are done via the central database and stored therein. All stakeholders with legal rights to access such transmissions may do so by connecting to the central database. Full reuse and sharing of relevant transmissions is thus ensured. Amendments to Regulation (EU) 909/2014 (CSDR) All information, data, communications and requests transmitted under the CSDR are done via the central database and stored therein. All stakeholders with legal rights to access such transmissions may do so by connecting to the central database. Full reuse and sharing of relevant transmissions is thus ensured.

During this phase, staff to prepare for new mandates should be recruited. It is expected that 10 FTEs, plus 2 FTEs overhead per sector will be needed for this work. The assumption retained is that ESMA will have time to recruit additional FTEs so that they are operational from 2028-mid-2028.  · The Executive Board will be installed, one year after entry into force, mid-2028 to start laying the ground for direct supervision and preparing cooperation arrangements. As of mid-2029 direct supervision starts – full staffing for trading and post-trading should be achieved by this date. Full staffing for the supervision of crypto asset service providers should , however, be achieved gradually until 2031. The standard annual cost retained (2025 current) for a Temporary Agent is EUR 188 000, for a Contract Agent, it is EUR 101 000 and for a Seconded National Expert it is EUR 103 000, all of which include EUR 30 000 of ‘habillage’ costs.  · The correction coefficient applicable to staff salaries in Paris (ESMA) is 114,2 (2025 basis);  · Employer’s pension contributions for Temporary Agents and Contract Agents have not been included in the estimates. For fee-funded direct supervisory tasks, 100% of the employer’s pension contributions would be included in the fees charged to the supervised entities. For non-direct supervisory tasks, the cost of which would be borne by the EU and the NCAs, the NCA share of such contributions, would as is the case now, be paid by NCAs to ESMA (the EU share being borne directly by the Union budget and not passing through the ESMA budget).  · Resource overhead staff are contract agents, temporary agents including assistants, and seconded national experts.  · A 2% inflation rate was applied as from 2027 on the 2025 standard rates.  Title II – Infrastructure and operating expenditure  Costs are based upon multiplying the number of staff by the proportion of the year employed by the standard cost for ‘habillage’, i.e. EUR 30 000 (covering buildings, IT basic support, etc.). A 2% inflation rate is applied.  Title III – Operational expenditure  Costs are estimated subject to the following assumptions:  · The one-off IT costs set out in section D are assumed to be implemented evenly over two years (2028-2029 for the Supervisory Platform, the CASP market surveillance system and the funds database; 2030-2031 for the centralised data and analytics), taking account of the time needed for preparation, planning and contracting.  · IT costs (development and maintenance) are based on best estimates of marginal supplementary expenses to be actually incurred over years 2028 to 2034 and allocated to either direct supervision or supervisory activities and their respective funding scheme.  · As an exception to the applicable funding scheme,  · t he costs of IT development that is linked to direct supervision will be paid for by the EU at the development stage and recovered over the subsequent five years via a reduction of the EU contribution, corresponding to the depreciated costs of the IT infrastructure for an amount of EUR 12.2 million . The subsequent annual maintenance costs (and any evolutionary development) will be fully fee-funded and would be borne from 2030 .  · the initial cost of the development of the new IT systems that are not linked to direct supervision, which are required for the implementation of this proposal, will be 100% paid by the EU (up to EUR 18.1 million after inflation). Thereafter, the costs of maintenance and evolutionary development of these systems would be borne equally by the EU and NCAs.  · A 2% inflation rate was applied as from 2027 on the 2025 current prices .  · M ission expenses , c ommunications services and g eneral meeting expenses are included as 1.25% of staff expenditure (Title 1), based on actual costs incurred at ESMA. This results in the following additional expenses:  Table: Row 1 — € million; 2028; 2029; 2030; 2031; 2032; 2033; 2034 Row 2 — EU share; 0,008; 0,027; 0,027; 0,028; 0,028; 0,029; 0,029 Row 3 — NCA share; 0,008; 0,027; 0,027; 0,028; 0,028; 0,029; 0,029 Row 4 — Fee funded; 0,094; 0,611; 0,737; 0,885; 0,902; 0,920; 0,939 Row 5 — Total; 0,110; 0,664; 0,792; 0,940; 0,959; 0,978; 0,997  All Titles – co-financing  The co-financing retained, from 2028 on, is a 50% contribution from the EU and 50% from NCAs for all the supplementary activities introduced by this initiative, that are co-financed at ESMA. These rates differ slightly from the rates of 40% and 60%, respectively, usually retained for co-financing based on Recital 68 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 establishing ESMA. This modification would not entail any changes as regards the way contributions are calculated for the activities introduced before this initiative that are co-financed at ESMA (they would continue to be financed 4 0% contribution from the EU and 6 0% from NCAs ) and as regards the way contributions from Member States are made in accordance with the weighting of votes 51 . The rationale is that, in light of the considerable reinforcement of ESMA’s mandate and the increasing Union-wide nature of its supervisory responsibilities, the financing of its activities should more accurately reflect the Union interest served by its work. Strengthening ESMA’s role in ensuring consistent and effective supervision across the internal market delivers benefits that accrue to the Union economy as a whole, and it is therefore appropriate that a greater share of the associated costs be borne by the EU budget, alleviating the pressure on national competent authorities while preserving a balanced and proportionate cost-sharing arrangement. This adjustment supports a fairer distribution of financial contributions, enhances budgetary predictability for Member States, and promotes an efficient and resilient supervisory framework capable of ensuring the proper functioning and further integration of Union capital markets.  Specific Assumptions  This legislative initiative will have an impact on costs incurred because of the changes brought (A) to enhance supervisory convergence, (B) to provide direct supervisory powers to ESMA, (C) overheads resources, (D) IT tools necessary for direct supervision and supervisory convergence, (E) to set up a new independent Executive Board. Finally, redeployment possibilities and efficiency gains have been explored (F).

Additionally, on the side of the Commission, there is a resource need to accompany the additional sectoral and horizontal responsibilities of ESMA. To ensure effective policy oversight, coordination, and enforcement of the new supervisory framework, 4 AD officials will be required within the Commission. Each official would reinforce a key policy area affected by the initiative: digital finance, market infrastructure, asset management, and supervision and convergence. These staff will be responsible for ongoing monitoring of ESMA’s expanded mandates, assessing the impact of new supervisory arrangements, ensuring policy coherence across sectors, and maintaining structured engagement with ESMA, NCAs, and stakeholders. Given the breadth and technical depth of the reforms, this level of staffing is considered the minimum necessary to ensure continuity, timely follow-up, and effective alignment of supervisory and legislative developments across the capital markets framework.  A. Enhanced supervisory convergence  In the asset management area, ESMA would ensure a coordinated approach to the oversight of large cross-border asset management groups through a mandate to carry out, together with NCAs, periodical group-wide reviews of the supervisory approach for asset management companies, which should foster a converged NCA supervision of asset management groups’ activities. This would potentially include operations, management, risk monitoring, or the corporate structure of the largest asset managers. Beyond those periodic reviews of large asset managers groups, coordination under ESMA would include monitoring risks on an ongoing basis, using dashboards derived from supervisory data and risk indicators to identify emerging vulnerabilities, and initiating investigations by joint teams, if necessary. For this oversight, up to 15 of the largest cross-border asset management groups should be chosen. For each group 1 FTEs should be planned. In all, 15 FTEs would be necessary. These would be co-financed by the EU and NCAs.  ESMA would be actively involved in the seamless passporting of UCITS funds and AIFs by centralising notifications, operating collaboration platforms, thereby addressing NCAs disagreement or handling stakeholders’ complaints. ESMA would exercise binding mediation powers. ESMA would coordinate the single market supervision of UCITS and AIFs through the establishment of collaboration platforms. ESMA would: (i) set the agenda for such collaboration platforms; (ii) host regular collaboration platforms, manage workflows, and share relevant information on a dedicated IT tool (data platform, accessible to NCAs) for UCITS funds and AIFs operating in the single market; (iii) initiate ad hoc collaboration platforms based on complaints from NCAs, market participants or consumers; and (iv) facilitate between NCAs in the collaboration platform. ESMA’s Executive Board and Board of Supervisors would have to play important roles in this regard. For this cross-border oversight, 15 FTEs should be planned. After a transitional period in 2028 with 5 FTEs fully financed by the EU to set up the function, ESMA would cover the cost of these tasks via fees applicable for the expenditure relating to the passporting procedures.  The proposal also foresees changes to horizontal supervisory convergence tools that would enhance and incentivise their use, as well as the establishment of new ones. It is expected that ESMA will use binding mediation, peer reviews and breach of Union law tools more often. In addition, new tools that have proven their effectiveness in sector legislation, such as collaboration platforms, would be included in the supervisory toolset. Collaboration platforms with a strong role for ESMA, would facilitate coordination and information exchange between home and host supervisory authorities for significant cross-border activities. An additional 10 FTEs should be foreseen for these tasks. Furthermore, 10 existing FTEs will be moved internally to convergence activities related to direct supervision. These FTEs will henceforth be fee-funded.  ESMA’s strong coordination role in the DLT Pilot Regulation continues, and will require more resources , since the threshold of the Pilot is increased. This will lead to more businesses checking into the Pilot and more work for ESMA. Additionally, ESMA will be the direct supervisor for a new distributed model for settlement of financial instruments (“settlement scheme”). Therefore, the 2 FTEs currently allocated at ESMA should be reinforced by additional staff , so as to reach 7 FTE in total. There is hence a need to continue with the 2 FTEs foreseen for this area in the context of the initial DLT pilot regulation and for 5 additional FTEs (the 2 FTEs which ESMA was allocated for the period 2022 to 2026 to implement Regulation 2022/858 establishing the DLT Pilot regime 52 will be extended to 2027 and thereafter, from 2028 ESMA will be allocated additional 5 FTEs). In addition, to co-finance the 2 FTEs for the DLT Pilot in 2027 according to the current standard 60:40 NCA:EU funding model, ESMA will be allocated EUR 149 376 of Union contribution on top of the financial programming for 2027 financing) .  B. Direct supervisory powers  As a preliminary remark, it is worth recalling that entities subject to direct supervision by ESMA pay fees to ESMA (one-off costs for registration and recurrent costs for ongoing supervision). This is currently the case for credit rating agencies, trade repositories, securitisation repositories, data reporting service providers, etc.  Under this legislative proposal, ESMA will be in charge of the direct supervision of large cross-border CCPs (up to around 8), CSDs (up to around 14) and trading venues (around 10 groups which would mean 150-200 trading venues). In relation to CASPs, ESMA should supervise all CASPs (up to 615) and become the sole supervisor of this sector in the EU.  We have conducted an analysis to determine the necessary staffing requirements. We have sent questionnaires to NCAs, asking about FTEs dedicated to the supervision of these sectors. The numbers per sector presented below, are based on input received from the NCAs, also relying on expertise from ESMA and the Commission’s own assessments.  We have calculated that 104 FTE posts at ESMA will be required to ensure effective supervision of the largest cross-border trading venue groups. A consultation of NCAs as regards the FTE needs to supervise trading venues indicated an average of approximately 2 FTEs per supervised entity across the 19 NCAs which participated in the survey. It is assumed that this headcount reflects the average resource needed at the level of each market operator.  The scope of the proposal targets approximately 30-40 operators, which manage the largest trading venues in the Union (there are ongoing changes in the market that make it difficult to have the precise estimate). Considering the upper bound of the proposed range of operators in scope and taking into account the fact that ESMA will receive new competences regarding the oversight of the compliance by trading venues with the organisational requirements pertaining to market surveillance, this estimate is corrected upwards to 2.5 FTEs per market operator. 4 FTEs are considered necessary to work on supervisory convergence in this area.  The trading venues that would fall under ESMA supervision have been selected based on their substantial market shares and, in some cases, EU/cross-border dimension, necessitating a robust supervisory set-up. As ESMA has not held any supervisory power over trading venues so far, it is essential to establish a new structure to facilitate the effective exercise of these responsibilities. The requested staffing level of 104 FTE posts is deemed necessary to ensure that ESMA can adequately discharge its new supervisory duties and maintain the high standards of oversight expected of it.  With regard to CCPs, ESMA would assume responsibility for the direct supervision of up to 8 of the most significant EU CCPs. ESMA would act as the ultimate decision-maker for supervisory matters, ensuring consistency and convergence across jurisdictions. According to the data that we have received, our estimate is that direct supervision of a CCP would require, on average, 6 FTEs. Applying this estimate to 8 CCPs results in a total requirement of 48 FTEs. Considering that ESMA already performs certain CCP-related tasks, notably in the area of model validation, a degree of efficiency can be achieved, and the estimate can be reduced by around 10%. 4 FTEs are considered necessary to work on supervisory convergence in this area. Consequently, the net additional staffing need for the supervision of CCPs is assessed at approximately 47 FTEs.  Turning to CSDs, ESMA would directly supervise the CSDs belonging to the largest European groups which together comprise up to 14 CSDs. For the purpose of this assessment, the CSDs should be broadly classified according to their systemic importance and scale of activity. The two international CSDs are expected to require more extensive supervisory engagement than medium-sized or small CSDs. Accordingly, the resource estimate takes into account the need for proportionality between different types of institutions. It is therefore assumed that the supervision of international CSDs would each require approximately 6 FTEs, medium-sized CSDs 3 FTEs, and smaller CSDs 2 FTEs. On this basis, the total supervisory resources required for the 14 CSDs belonging to the main EU groups are assessed at around 41 FTEs.  Given the expected synergies arising from the group structure of these entities, it is reasonable to expect that these FTE needs could be reduced by around one quarter. This would place the lower bound of the estimate at approximately 31 FTEs. In addition, 3-4 FTEs would be required for the cooperation and oversight tasks related to the TARGET2-Securities platform. 4 FTEs are considered necessary to work on supervisory convergence in this area. Taking these factors together, the overall FTE requirement for the direct supervision of CSDs is estimated to reach 39 FTEs.  Crypto assets is a new area and NCAs are only building their capacity and knowledge. Therefore, it is not possible to rely on current practice. For the purpose of this assessment, the CASPs should be broadly classified according to their systemic importance and scale of activity. Therefore, we can group them as significant and non-significant CASPs. For significant CASPs there would be 2.5 FTE/CASPs, for non-significant – 5 CASPs/FTE. 1 FTE is considered necessary to work on supervisory convergence in this area. In total it would be 158 FTEs for around 600 CASPs.  C. Overhead  The overheads in terms of resources support at the ESMA agency level cover Human Resources, Finance, Legal, Facility Management, Coordination and IT support. Based on ESMA's Activity Based Management system, 30% of the resources are dedicated to horizontal services. Taking into account that ESMA, while growing, can further develop economies of scale, we assumed in this Legislative Financial Statement that the overheads in terms of resources and the legal support would represent 20% of the total staff.  D. IT tools necessary for direct supervision and supervisory convergence  Supervisory data platform coverage of CCPs, CSDs, TV and for the designation and registration of systems under the Settlement Finality Regulation (SFR)  Estimated cost: EUR 8M for development and EUR 3.7M for annual maintenance. Based on actual use across all supervision mandates, the platform would cover up to 80% of direct supervisory needs and up to 20% of other activities via functionalities supporting document collaboration and notifications between Union and Member State authorities.  Based on the funding approach adopted for the development of the IT systems, the EU would fund 100% of the development cost. Thereafter, the share of the depreciated cost applicable to direct supervision mandates would be recovered via fees.  Based upon, activity based costing, the cost of the maintenance (and evolutionary development) of the system(s) would be split between fees charged to directly supervised entities on the one side and between the EU and NCAs on the other side for non-direct supervision tasks (with that part of the cost being split equally between the EU and the NCAs).  ESMA has multiple mandates in Union legislation to develop and maintain databases and tools for the submission, exchange and access to supervisory information. To ensure these systems are developed and maintained efficiently, to avoid duplication of IT investments, and to ensure the accuracy and interoperability of data, the supervisory data platform should integrate ESMA’s existing supervisory databases and related tools within a single architecture.  Accordingly, ESMA's supervisory platform, initially designed to support supervisory tasks under EMIR 3, should therefore be expanded to include data collection and management for supervisory oversight of CSDs, CCPs, and TVs and to provide the additional capabilities required for the Settlement Finality Regulation, building on this integrated technical architecture. The Commission estimates that integrating the management of ESMA’s supervision mandates within a single supervisory data platform allows for a more efficient solution and results in a lower overall cost compared with developing separate systems for the new supervisory mandates individually.  Maintenance should cover the full cost of operating the platform, including high-quality support to all stakeholders — staff from the ESAs and other Union institutions and bodies, competent authorities and supervised entities — as well as system and security operations, corrective, preventive and adaptive maintenance such as mandatory lifecycle and security upgrades and incremental functional enhancements. It should also include the necessary infrastructure to ensure continuous availability and performance of the platform, in particular the sufficient compute and storage capacity required for the collection, processing and retention of both unstructured (e.g. documents) and structured (e.g. prudential) information used for supervisory risk assessments.  All relevant competent authorities and bodies should have access to such a platform for the information pertinent to their tasks and responsibilities. Similarly, entities subject to the requirements of corresponding regulations should have access to the information and documentation they submitted, and any information and documentation addressed to them. The data platform should be used for the swift and efficient sharing of as much information and documentation as possible.  Central register for CASPs markets surveillance  Estimated cost: EUR 4.2M for development and EUR 2.5M for annual maintenance. The costs of development will be paid for by the EU and recovered over the subsequent five years via a reduction of the EU contribution, corresponding to the depreciated costs of the IT infrastructure. The annual maintenance costs will be fully fee-funded.  ESMA is expected to develop and operate a centralised data and market surveillance system for CASPs, building on the ongoing work on MIDAS (Markets Integrity Data Analysis System). The system would serve as a pan-EU data hub for the collection, aggregation, and analysis of transaction and order data reported by CASPs under MiCA and related implementing acts. Its core purpose would be to enhance market integrity, detect market abuse, and support both direct and indirect supervision of crypto markets.  The system would integrate regulatory and market data flows collected directly from CASPs, ensuring consistent and harmonised data access across the EU, and enabling timely identification of potential risks. ESMA would operate as a central analytics and monitoring centre, responsible for:  – Collecting and standardising data from CASPs and trading platforms across Member States;  – Running advanced data analytics and surveillance algorithms to detect suspicious or abusive trading behaviour, price manipulation, or insider dealing;  – Flagging potential issues or anomalies for investigation and enforcement;  – Providing aggregated insights to support ESMA’s own direct supervision of CASPs and to facilitate cooperation with national competent authorities.  The Commission estimates that the current system developed by ESMA for MiCA monitoring by NCAs will be adapted to a centralised model, with costs proportionate to the number of CASPs to be integrated into the system.  Maintenance should cover the full operational cost of running the system, including high-quality support for all stakeholders — staff from the ESAs and other Union entities, competent authorities, and supervised entities — as well as system and security operations and corrective, preventive and adaptive maintenance, such as mandatory lifecycle and security upgrades and incremental capability improvements. It should also finance the necessary infrastructure, including sufficient compute and storage capacity for the collection, processing and retention of unstructured (e.g. documents) and structured information (e.g. prudential data) used for supervisory risk assessments. The system should therefore ensure continuous availability, data integrity and security, and support the efficient execution of ESMA’s supervisory functions.  Data platform for cross-border notifications of funds and interaction between home and host NCAs on cross-border matters  Estimated cost: EUR 1,000,000 for development and EUR 200,000 for annual maintenance. The costs of development will be paid for by the EU and recovered over the subsequent five years via a reduction of the EU contribution, corresponding to the depreciated costs of the IT infrastructure. The annual maintenance costs (and any evolutionary development costs) will be fully fee-funded.  This cost reflects an upgrade of the existing register in the ESAP system, which currently stores information on cross-border fund activities, in order to include additional information required to support enhanced supervisory cooperation under the AIFMD and UCITS frameworks, while maintaining data collection via NCAs. The objective is to develop a one-stop-shop system that reduces the need for multiple bilateral exchanges currently required between home and host competent authorities and stakeholders in the context of the notification of the cross-border marketing of funds. This system will serve as a central interface for ESMA and the 27 NCAs, providing a secure channel for home–host documentation access and communication of procedural steps. It will provide funds and managers with a single point accessing information for cross-border activities more generally. To deliver these capabilities, the system must store and provide submission functionalities for reliable, always up-to-date and quality-checked documentation, including automated translation services for submitted documents.  The data platform must be up to date at all times so that information is accurate and reliable and allows for immediate access for both NCAs and stakeholders.  Key functionalities include:  – interconnectedness between ESMA and all 27 NCAs, ensuring secure and timely data exchange,  – automatic translation into official languages of the Union, supporting direct usability across Member States ,  – a public portal for transparency,  – user friendly interfaces, for both non-public and public information to share, access and retrieve information in a secure and efficient manner.  Centralised data and analytics  Estimated cost: EUR 15M for development and EUR 4M annual maintenance. The EU would support 100% of the development costs of that platform over 2030 and 2031.  For this the EU would increase its contribution in order to further fund this development, by adding an amount of EUR 8.2 million to the amount that would be expected on the basis of a 50% contribution to ESMA for that development, thus reducing the NCAs contribution by the same amount. The annual maintenance (and any further evolutionary development) would be co-financed equally by EU and NCAs.  This initiative will contribute to the development of supervisory technology tools and to the efficient exchange of information within the EU as part of a common Union financial data strategy.  Funding will support the progressive enhancement of ESMA’s central systems to provide the functionalities listed below covering all the relevant mandates under Union legislation:  – provide common tools for market analysis and supervision, in collaboration with competent authorities;  – enable timely sharing of supervisory insights with competent authorities; and  – facilitate secure, standardised data access and exchange across the EU supervisory framework.  These shared solutions are expected to create efficiencies for competent authorities and support consistent supervisory practices in the Union.

New Executive Board  A new Executive Board would be composed of ESMA’s Chair and 5 full time independent members, with diverse composition, bringing different types of supervisory expertise (e.g. CCPs, CSD, trading venues, asset managers/funds, prudential, central banks, etc.). They should be experienced and should be recruited as AD temporary agents of a grade of AD 14. The Executive Director would equally be recruited as an AD 14 temporary agent. The Executive Board would be the main decision-making body for direct supervision and supervisory convergence measures that target individual entities. The Executive Board would also take over the tasks of the current Management Board. The Executive Board will be operational as of mid-2028. Tasks linked to direct supervision would be financed through fees, and tasks linked to supervisory convergence (up to 10% of total tasks) would be co-financed by the Union budget and NCA’s contributions.  F. Redeployment and efficiency gains  The scope for redeployment is limited, considering the nature and scope of this initiative. Nevertheless, efficiency gains have been examined thoroughly in order to limit costs, wherever possible. For instance, as explained above, economies of scale are anticipated in the extent of additional overhead needed.  A key efficiency is that ESMA’s current capacity to levy fees would be largely relied upon to deal with the increased number of entities to be charged. In particular, no specific IT developments are included as regards fees management, as it is expected that ESMA will rely on their current IT systems, to handle the extended scope of application.  In order to further reduce the costs incurred by ESMA, a large number of new FTEs could be employed as Contract Agents (CAs), Assistants (AST) or Seconded National Experts (SNEs). However, the number of SNEs should not be overestimated. ESMA might face difficulties in recruiting such experts because of the costs this would represent for Member States and national competent authorities. In addition to these difficulties related to their availability, in the area of direct supervision, it should be expected that they will provide essential experience when ESMA takes up those tasks, but in the long run beyond the start-up phase it will be more important for ESMA to maintain expertise in-house and rely relatively more on Temporary Agent staff.  The following table provides for an indicative split of staff into those categories.

CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  Union legislation should deliver its policy objectives efficiently, effectively and transparently. These longstanding principles can be traced back to the 2001 White paper on Governance ( 1 ) which put better regulation and stakeholder engagement at the heart of European policymaking. The Competitiveness Compass ( 2 ) continues the promotion of responsible law-making . It announced unprecedented efforts to simplify legislation to reignite the competitiveness of European business. Moreover, the Commission has since strengthened targets to reduce administrative costs for business (together with public authorities) and Small and Medium sized Entreprises by 25% and 35% respectively ( 3 ).  A mature body of Union environmental law now exists. The Commission takes seriously its duty to manage these laws effectively and invests heavily in reviewing ( 4 ) their application to ensure that they deliver as intended and that problematic issues are tackled early. Moreover, the Commission is committed to ‘stress-test’ all EU laws under its current term of office. The content of this proposal (and others in the ‘omnibus’ package) represents the initial fruits of the Commission’s ongoing ‘stress-testing’ in the environment area ( 5 ) built on extensive dialogue and inputs from civil society. The omnibus package addresses legislation related to the circular economy, the operation of industrial installations, the management of geospatial data, and environmental permitting.  The above legislation are crucial parts of delivering the Union’s commitment to a fair green, and digital transition and the shift towards a circular economy in particular. It is important that this legislation works well, mobilises the Union’s assets like the single market and avoids imposing unnecessary costs on business, public authorities and citizens.  This specific proposed Directive aims to reduce the administrative burden for producers established in one Member State of the Union selling their products in other Member States, in relation to the participation of these producers in the extended producer responsibility schemes in those other Member States, set up under the following EU instruments:  – Directive 2008/98/EC on waste ( 6 )  – Directive 2012/ 19/EU on waste electric and electronic equipment ( 7 )  – Directive (EU) 2019/904 on the reduction of the impact of certain plastic products on the environment ( 8 ).  This proposal suspends certain provisions of the above Directives in the area of environment, waste management. Further possible modifications of those Directives or further suspensions of their provisions are entirely outside of the scope and aims of the present proposal. The need for such modifications may be assessed, as appropriate, in the context of further stress-testing of EU environmental legislation announced in the [Chapeau Communication] and in Commission work programme 2026. The Commission will constructively engage with the co-legislators, in order to ensure that the legislative process on the present proposal fully preserves its essential object and does not distort it.  The producer of a product placed on the market of a Member State has the responsibility to cover the costs of managing the product at its end of life (so called ‘Extended Producer Responsibility or EPR). The Waste Framework Directive sets out the minimum general requirements for extended producer responsibility while specific rules for different product groups exist in other legislation such as the Regulation on packaging and packaging waste, the Regulation on batteries and waste batteries, the Directive on electrical and electronical waste, and the Single Use Plastics Directiv e , as well the Directive on end-of-life vehicles (currently subject to revision under an ongoing ordinary legislative procedure) ( 9 ). Member States may also establish national rules on extended producer responsibility for other products, provided these rules comply with the minimum requirements set out in Article 8 and 8a of the Waste Framework Directive.  An authorised representative for EPR acts on behalf of an economic operator (producer) selling products in a Member State where the producer is not established or if it is established in a third country. The purpose is to ensure that producers making available products on the territory of a Member State comply with the rules on EPR so that the costs of waste management are covered.  In the May 2025 Communication on a strategy for the single market( 10 ), the Commission highlighted the complexity of EPR rules as a major barrier in the internal market, in particular the possibility or obligation for a producer to have an authorised representative for EPR in each Member State where the producer makes its products available .  The proposal would provide additional flexibility by allowing producers established in the Union and selling products in another Member State to choose whether they appoint an authorised representative for EPR. Provisions regarding the appointment of authorised representatives for EPR for producers based in third countries should remain as they currently are contained in sectoral legislation.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  The current proposal promotes a similar approach across circular economy/waste legislation regarding the operation of schemes for extended producer responsibility. This will facilitate the functioning of the internal market while aiding business operations.  • Consistency with other Union policies  This proposal is part of a package of measures aimed primarily at cutting red tape for economic operators. It is entirely consistent with the Commission’s policies on better regulation, and the objectives of the Competitiveness compass to promote greater competitiveness and economic resilience in the Union. The rationalisation introduced by these measures will not affect the achievement of the objectives in the concerned policy area nor the rationale of the legislative acts  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  The legal base of the proposal is 192(1) TFEU. This reflects the underlying legal bases of the Directives containing provisions on authorised representatives for extended producer responsibility that the proposal suspends.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  Directive on Waste: Waste is a commodity that can cross national borders and will increasingly do so as progress is made in establishing a circular economy. Common rules and approaches are needed across the Union to ensure that waste is managed uniformly and that materials are reused and recycled in the same ways in order that markets can function efficiently. Changes to the rules on waste therefore must also be addressed at Union level.  Directive preventing harm from certain plastic items (single use plastics): Litter does not respect national borders and litter from one member State can be found the seas and beaches of another member State. Moreover, measures needed to tackle litter need to be consistent in order to prevent fragmentation in the functioning of markets in certain products. The EU Directive on single use products is therefore necessary and provides added value above what Member States could achieve acting alone. Changes to these rules also require action at EU level.  Directive on waste electrical and electronical equipment: Electrical and electronical waste is a commodity that can cross national borders and will increasingly do so as progress is made in establishing a circular economy. Common rules and approaches are needed across the Union to ensure that electric and electronic waste is managed uniformly and that materials are reused and recycled in the same ways in order that markets can function efficiently. Changes to the rules on electrical and electronical waste therefore must also be addressed at Union level.  • Proportionality  In the case of the circular economy legislation, the proposal would introduce alternative means to deliver the policy objectives of ensuring that waste products are appropriately managed at the end of their useful life. These respond to the concerns of producers operating across Member States.  • Choice of the instrument  A proposal for a Directive is the appropriate choice of instrument given that the pieces of legislation the proposal suspends are Directives.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  A targeted revision of t he Directive on waste was recently adopted by the Legislator based on a Commission proposal that was supported by an impact assessment. The targeted revision introduced a new obligation for the Commission to evaluate the Directive by end 2029 and amend if appropriate. An evaluation of t he Directive on waste electrical and electronical equipment has recently been conducted 11 . An evaluation of the Directive on preventing harm from certain plastics products is ongoing and completion is expected in 2027.  • Stakeholder consultations  The staff working document accompanying this proposal provides more information on the various consultation activities that have been undertaken to support the preparation of this proposal. The key consultation activities are summarised below.  The following consultation activities have been carried out to prepare this omnibus proposal:  – A call for evidence 12 for the environmental omnibus open for feedback from 22 July 2025 to 10 September 2025.  – A high-level roundtable on simplifying environmental laws on 2 October 2025.  The call for evidence on environmental simplification drew a lot of attention . The Commission published a call for evidence on the environmental simplification package on the Have-Your-Say website: Simplification of administrative burdens in environmental legislation . The feedback period was from 22 July 2025 till 10 September 2025. All feedback is published on the Have-Your-Say website.  There were 190 998 contributions to the call for evidence, of which 189 751 (99.3%) came from citizens. 1 247 (0.7%) contributions came from organisations other than citizens, including businesses and business associations, non-governmental organisations (environmental and other), public authorities and academics. 622 attachments, mainly position papers, were attached to these submissions, which often included specific suggestions.  From a business perspective, there is support for less burdensome regulation that leaves business with flexibility to deliver both growth and sustainable production. There is a perception of administrative obligations that are too prescriptive, and do not provide value added.  On the side of civil society, there is support for a simplification that makes it easier to protect the environment and social standards and avoid deregulation, for example by removing redundancies and avoiding excessively detailed regulations. There is however concern that efforts to simplify regulations could undermine environmental protections. Citizens urged the EU to focus on enforcing existing laws rather than creating new simplifications.  The Commission is currently preparing an impact assessment to support the preparation of the Circular Economy Act in 2026. This assessment will utilise ongoing consultation activities that will also cover simplification of existing (waste and circular economy-related) legislation, and particularly EPR related legislation.  • Collection and use of expertise  The Commission contracted an external service provider to provide expertise related to this proposal. In particular, the contractor has screened the known body of environmental laws to identify reporting and other administrative obligations together with potential to simplify these obligations. In addition, the contractor has provided assistance in quantifying the reductions in costs of possible measures to simplify provisions in the omnibus package. All information provided by the contractor will be published.  • Impact assessment  An impact assessment has not been prepared primarily because the proposal is highly specific with little choice available to remedy the underlying issues. A staff working document does however accompany this proposal. It justifies the content of the proposal and presents quantitative information about the expected impacts. It also presents the views and inputs of stakeholders which the Commission has received.  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  Under the regulatory fitness and performance programme (REFIT), the Commission ensures that its legislation is fit for purpose, targeted to the needs of stakeholders, and minimises burdens while achieving its objectives. This proposal is therefore part of, and fully coherent with, the REFIT programme in so far as it attempts to simplify administrative procedures related to the appointment of authorised representatives for extended producer responsibility and reduce unnecessary costs for producers.  • Fundamental rights  The proposal has no adverse impact on fundamental rights as enshrined in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights as it solely impacts the appointment of an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility.4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  Not applicable.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  Given the very specific nature of the proposal, there is no need for implementation plans to guide the transposition and application of the new provisions. Existing monitoring and reporting provisions in the affected Directives will continue.  • Explanatory documents (for directives)  Given the very specific nature of the proposal, there is no need to require explanatory documents from the Member States regarding their transposition.  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  Article 1 suspends the application of Article 22a(3), first subparagraph, of Directive 2008/98/EC, Article 17(2) of Directive 2012/19/EU and Article 8(7) of Directive 2019/904 until January 2035.  2025/0396 (COD)  Proposal for a  DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  suspending the application of the rules on the appointment of authorised representatives for extended producer responsibility for waste, waste electrical and electronical equipment and single use plastic waste  (Text with EEA relevance)  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 192(1) thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 13 ,  Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions 14 ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) The political guidelines for the Commission’s 2024-2029 term 15 point to the goal of simplifying, consolidating and codifying legislation to eliminate any overlaps and contradictions while maintaining high standards and staying the course on the goals set out in the European Green Deal .  (2) In its Communication of 11 February 2025 entitled ‘A simpler and faster Europe: Communication on implementation and simplification’, 16 the European Commission set out a vision for an implementation and simplification agenda that delivers fast and visible improvements for people and business on the ground. That requires more than an incremental approach and the Union is to take bold action to achieve that goal. The European Parliament, the Council, the Commission, the Member States’ authorities at all levels and stakeholders need to work together to streamline and simplify Union , national and regional rules and implement policies more effectively.  (3) In its Communication on a Strategy for the Single Market 17 , the Commission identified as a barrier to the internal market t hat b usinesses face inconsistent national regulations which makes it harder to sell, scale or move goods and services across borders. The Commission committed to focus on the ten most harmful barriers as a priority . The Communication identified c ertain features of extended producer responsibility schemes as one of the barriers most frequently reported by companies operating cross-border in the Union . While extended producer responsibility schemes are derived from Union legislation, a lack of uniformity of principles and requirements has led to a large diversity of extended producer responsibility schemes set up in Member States as well as to regulatory complexity and high administrative burden for companies. Th is Directive is a first stepping stone to more profound simplification of the extended producer responsibility schemes in the area of waste, while the upcoming Circular Economy act should provide for further simplification.  (4) In particular, d ue to that lack of harmonisation , in particular regarding the current provisions in sectoral legislation for the appointment of an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility , the fulfilment of the obligations related to the appointment may result in an unnecessary administrative burden on producers operating in multiple Member States where they are not established . Particularly for small and m edium -sized enterprises , the obligation to appoint authorised representatives separately for every Member State where the producer places products on the market pose s a significant challenge in terms of costs . With a view to ensuring equal conditions for producers established in the Union , it is important that the rules for appointing an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility in Directives 2008/98/EC 18 , 2012 /19/EU 19 and (EU) 2019/904 20 of the European Parliament and of the Council have the same content . The current ly fragment ed legal framework for different products and the significant administrative burden associated with fulfilling the requirement to appoint an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility in up to 2 6 Member States is hampering the competitiveness of producers established in the Union . It is thus crucial to harmonise the existing rules effectively and promptly, reducing the associated burdens on producers . To this effect, the Commission is currently review ing the effective ness, the administrative burden entailed and the unintended barriers for the internal market , of the obligation to appoint authorised representative s as a safeguard for the producers’ compliance with the ‘polluter pays‘ principle. This review is likely to lead to alternative solutions which are more effective and less burdensome .  (5) W ith a view to simplifying requirements on producers , and reducing the administrative burden, producers of textile, textile-related or footwear , electrical and electronical equipment and single use plastic products (‘producers’) should be able to choose whether they appoint an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility when making available products on the market of a nother Member State where they are not established. Therefore , Member States should not make the appointment of an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility mandatory for producers established in the Union , but the option for producers to appoint an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility at their discretion should be maintained . This allows producers who have already appointed an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility to retain their existing arrangements , while immediately alleviating the costs and administrative burden for producers who wish to not appoint an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility .  (6) Ensuring traceability and enforcement with regards to producers established in third countries is more challenging compared to those operating within the Union, as such producers fall outside the territorial scope of Member States’ enforcement powers and are not covered by the U nion administrative and judicial cooperation mechanisms that facilitate the enforcement of obligations and judgments within the internal market . Making the appointment of an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility voluntary for producers established in third countr ies could thus increase the risk of freeriding , where producers do not fulfil their legal obligations such as registration, reporting, providing a guarantee or participating in a collective scheme , and c ould create loopholes for non-compliant producers established in third countries . Thus, the provision in Directive 2008/98/EC that allows Member States to provide that a producer established in a third country and making textile, textile-related or footwear products available for the first time on their territory by means of distance contracts directly to end-users is to appoint, by written mandate, a legal or natural person established on their territory as its authorised representative for the purpose of fulfilling the obligations of a producer related to the extended producer responsibility scheme on their territory should remain applicable . However, Member States should be allowed to ensure traceability and enforcement with regard to producers established in third countries through alternative means.  (7) Th e provisions in Directives 2008/98/EC, 2012/19/EU and (EU) 2019/904 which make the appointment of an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility mandatory should be suspended until 1 January 2035.  (8) The Commission is prepar ing a legislative proposal for a comprehensive reform of the extended producer responsibility system . The proposal is expected to be tabled by the Commission, in accordance with its Work Programme, in 2026. The legislative proposal will be subject to the ordinary legislative procedure and, if adopted by the European Parliament and by the Council, the Member States and the producers will have to take the necessary measures to align their regulatory and organisational measures, as well as their conduct to the new rules with regard to the extended producer responsibility .  (9) The provisions in Directives 2008/98/EC, 2012/19/EU and (EU) 2019/904 that currently set out that Member States are to allow producers established in the Union to appoint an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility leave a margin of discretion to Member States. Member States should not make the appointment of an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility mandatory in their national legislation.  (10) Suspending the application of the requirement for producers established in a Member State to appoint authori s ed representative s for extended producer responsibility when selling products in other Member States serves as a preliminary measure to immediately alleviate burdens and costs for producers who wish to not appoint an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility. This approach pav es the way for the implementation of a comprehensive reform of the extended producer responsibility system .  (11) Since the objectives of this Directive, namely to provide flexibility to producers established in the Union as to whether they appoint an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility , cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives ,  (12)  HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:  Article 1  Suspension  The application of the following provisions is suspended until 1 January 2035:  (a) Article 22a ( 3 ) of Directive 2008/98/EC .  Member States may either provide that a producer as defined in Article 3(4b), point (d), of that Directive established in a third country and making textile, textile-related or footwear products listed in Annex IVc of that Directive available for the first time on their territory is to appoint, by written mandate, a legal or natural person established on their territory as its authorised representative for the purpose of fulfilling the obligations of a producer related to the extended producer responsibility scheme on their territory or ensure traceability and enforcement with regard to producers established in third countries through alternative means;  (b) Article 17 (2) of Directive 2012/19 /EU ;  (c) Article 8 ( 7 ) of Directive (EU) 2019/904 .  Article 2  Transposition  1. Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by [OP: please insert date 1 2 months after entry into force of this Directive] at the latest. They shall forthwith communicate to the Commission the text of those provisions.  When Member States adopt those provisions, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or be accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication. Member States shall determine how such reference is to be made.  2. Member States shall communicate to the Commission the text of the main provisions of national law which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive.

FRAMEWORK OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE  1.1. Title of the proposal/initiative  Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council suspending the application of the rules on the appointment of authorised representatives for extended producer responsibility for waste, waste electrical and electronical equipment and single use plastic waste  1.2. Policy area(s) concerned  Environment  European Green Deal  1.3. Objective(s)  1.3.1. General objective(s)  The general objective pursued by this legislative proposal is to simplify elements of Directives 2008/98/EC, 2012/19/EU and (EU) 2019/904 with regard to the appointment of an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility.  1.3.2. Specific objective(s)  By suspending the application of the provisions in Regulation of Directives 2008/98/EC, 2012/19/EU and (EU) 2019/904 that mandate the appointment of an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility for producers established in the Union, such producers will be able to choose whether they appoint an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility when making available products on the market of another Member State where they are not established, but the appointment will not be mandatory. This allows those producers who have already appointed an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility to retain their existing arrangements, while immediately alleviating the costs and administrative burden for producers who wish to not appoint an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility.  1.3.3. Expected result(s) and impact  Specify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.  The proposed suspension of the application of the mandatory appointment of an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility for producers established in the Union will alleviate administrative burden and costs from the producers of packaging and batteries. Especially SMEs will benefit from not having to appoint an authorised representatives.  1.3.4. Indicators of performance  Specify the indicators for monitoring progress and achievements. To monitor progress towards achieving the proposal’s specific objectives, the Commission will explore the possibility of organising exchanges with Member States in different formats, including by using the existing fora.  1.4. The proposal/initiative relates to:   a new action   a new action following a pilot project / preparatory action 21   the extension of an existing action   a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action  1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative  1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative  The suspension should apply until 1 January 2035.  1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, greater effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this section 'added value of EU involvement' is the value resulting from EU action, that is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone. The proposal will create a harmonised approach across sectoral legislation. To ensure uniform conditions for producers within the Union, it is essential that the same provisions are applied across Member States for appointing an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility. The existing fragmented legal framework for various products and the administrative challenges linked with appointing an authorised representative in up to 26 Member States are hindering the competitiveness of Union-based producers. It is necessary to efficiently and swiftly harmonise the current rules, thereby alleviating the burdens faced by these producers.  1.5.3.

 REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulation (EU) 2021/691 as regards support to workers affected by imminent job displacement in enterprises undergoing restructuring  EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM  1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  The aim of this proposal is to enable the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for Displaced Workers (‘the EGF’) to not only support displaced workers, but also workers affected by imminent job displacement.  Employees of enterprises undergoing restructuring should be able to benefit from personalised packages of measures in case they are affected by imminent job displacement. To enable their employees to benefit from such support, enterprises undergoing restructuring may request the relevant Member State to submit an application for EGF assistance if the intervention criteria are met and if the enterprise wishes to offer EGF co-financed assistance.  Restructuring events often occur in a series of waves of lay-offs. Under its current set-up, the EGF is only able to help workers that have already lost their jobs. However, if it is already known when a next batch of workers will lose their jobs, they should be helped in response to this imminent threat so as to mitigate its impact.  Whereas longer-term anticipatory assistance falls under the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+), the EGF is an emergency instrument to respond to restructuring events. This proposal supports and strengthens the emergency character of the EGF. In the short term, it is often not possible to reprogramme ESF+ funding, and enterprises undergoing restructuring have limited means to support the workers affected by redundancy. The EGF could fill this gap by responding to restructuring events occurring over a mid-term timeframe.  According to the Autumn 2024 Economic Forecast, growth in the EU is expected to pick up to 1.5% in 2025, as consumption shifts up a gear and investment is set to rebound from the contraction of 2024. However, elevated uncertainty and structural shifts are expected to weigh on segments of the economy, notably in manufacturing. Whereas the EU experienced a phase of extraordinary employment growth over the past few years, data from Eurofound’s European Restructuring Monitor show that the tide has been turning since 2024. The number of jobs cuts announced for the near future related to large-scale restructuring within the EU now far exceeds the number of job creations.  According to the data collected by the European Restructuring Monitor, large-scale restructuring across all countries observed and all sectors lasted for more than a year (387 days). The larger the restructuring event, the longer the duration. For restructuring events involving more than 3 000 workers, the average duration is almost 1 000 days.  Economic disruptions, for example those caused by the twin transition or by globalisation, have adverse effects on workers whose skills are no longer needed. However, employment contraction can go hand-in-hand with labour and skills shortages. Therefore, the workers concerned must be supported by access to active labour market policy measures, such as education and retraining, to allow them to acquire the skills needed to move into new roles or jobs.  In light of the twin transition and new geopolitical challenges, it is vital to enhance productivity growth while ensuring social inclusion and preserving equity, to ensure that workers benefit from EU solidarity.  This proposal is therefore needed to cushion the adverse effects economic disruptions have on the workforce, and to boost the EU’s economic competitiveness. It underlines the character of the EGF as a reactive emergency response instrument to assist workers who are affected by imminent job displacement in enterprises undergoing restructuring.  The support provided to those workers would consist of packages of personalised services to equip them with the skills needed to move into a different role, or to change jobs. Short-time work schemes are not eligible given they are funded by Member States’ national budgets. Extending EU solidarity to those workers through such support would take into account existing support that are available to them at national level.  Workers who are affected by imminent job displacement or anticipate job displacement in enterprises undergoing restructuring can benefit from EGF support under the provisions setting the support available to displaced workers.  In the current context of economic disruptions, it is vital to support both workers who are made redundant and workers who anticipate imminent job displacement by accelerating the procedure to mobilise EGF support. To achieve that, Regulation (EU) 2021/691 could set out a procedure whereby the Commission, under strict conditions, can request the European Parliament and the Council to mobilise the full maximum annual amount budget at the beginning of each year. If that mobilisation is approved, the Commission would adopt individual financing decisions in relation to the applications introduced by the EU countries concerned. The Commission will immediately inform the European Parliament and the Council of its adoption, including the conditions that led the Commission adopting the financing decisions, as well as the corresponding amounts.  If the full maximum annual amount is not used by the Commission in a given year, that amount will lapse at the end of the financial year.  The proposed amendment will be fully accommodated within the existing provisions of the MFF Regulation (Article 8 of Council Regulation 2020/2093 of 17 December (as amended by Council Regulation 2024/765 of 29 February 2024), as well as with the existing provisions of the Interinstitutional Agreement between the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission on budgetary discipline, cooperation in budgetary matters, sound financial management, and new own resources of 16 December 2020 (Point 9) (the IIA).  This proposal also assists enterprises undergoing restructuring in actively managing economic transitions in a socially responsible manner.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area and other Union policies  This proposal is one of the flagship actions under pillar 4 of the EU’s industrial action plan for the European automotive sector COM(2025) 95 final. It supports the aims of the Union of  Skills and the European Competitiveness Compass.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  The legal basis is the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), and in particular the third paragraph of Article 175.  If specific actions are needed that fall outside the scope of the EU Structural Funds, Article 175 third paragraph TFEU allows the European Parliament and the Council to take action in line with the ordinary legislative procedure and after consulting the European Economic and Social Committee and the European Committee of the Regions.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  Funding from the EU budget concentrates on activities whose objectives cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States alone, and where EU intervention can bring additional value compared to Member States acting alone. The mobilisation of the EGF to fund measures aimed at assisting displaced workers and those affected by imminent job displacement to find new employment respects the principle of subsidiarity and creates European added value.  It is standard practice for national labour market programmes to assist displaced workers, and it is also good practice for companies to train their workforce. The EGF does not aim to replace such programmes. In case of restructuring events that have a significant impact on the labour market, the national labour market programmes are put at test. Companies undergoing restructuring often have limited budgets to help their surplus employees adjust. Therefore, because of the scale and effects of large-scale restructuring and as the EGF is an expression of solidarity in Member States, assistance can be better delivered at EU level. EGF support will make EU solidarity more meaningful for workers that have been affected by restructuring events and for Europeans in general.  The mobilisation of the EGF creates added value by increasing the overall number of services offered to workers affected by restructuring events, as well as the variety of services offered and their level of intensity. The EGF can also test innovative ideas, identify best practices and incorporate them into the national support packages. EGF co-financed measures also contribute in general to improving the support available to workers facing job displacement.  • Proportionality  In line with the principle of proportionality, this proposal does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve its goals. The administrative burden on the EU and on the national authorities applying for EGF support has been limited to what is necessary for the Commission to exercise its responsibility in implementing the EU’s budget. Since the financial contribution is made to the EU country under the principle of shared management, that country will be required to report on how the funding was used.  • Choice of the instrument  Since this proposal amends Regulation (EU) 2021/691, the instrument has to be a Regulation.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  This proposal is adopted in response to the heightened economic uncertainty and risks as well as the fact that the EGF does not respond appropriately to restructuring events that occur over longer timeframes. The Commission has analysed the challenges and concluded that this proposal is needed to ensure that the EGF can respond effectively to show solidarity with workers, regions, and enterprises that have been affected.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  The EGF is a special instrument not included in the budgetary ceilings of the multiannual financial framework. Article 8(1) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2020/2093 laying down the multiannual financial framework for the years 2021 to 2027, as amended byArticle 1(4) of Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/765 of 29 February 2024, provides that the EGF may not exceed a maximum annual amount of EUR 30 million (in 2018 prices), based on Article 312 TFEU. This proposal, based on Article 175 TFEU, cannot amend the maximum annual amount.  The functioning of the EGF is governed by point 9 of the draft Interinstitutional Agreement between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial management. The present proposal is compatible with these provisions.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  The proposed amendments specify that announced job displacements that will occur over a certain timeframe in the near future fall within the EGF’s scope. The aim is to allow for a more common approach to job displacements triggered by large-scale restructuring events. Enterprises undergoing restructuring must be able to request EGF assistance through national authorities. The funding must be used to offer personalised packages of active labour market policy measures to workers that are affected by imminent job displacements in the near future.  Since the EGF is implemented under shared management, each EU country sets-up a single entry point to handle requests by enterprises. The EU country concerned then submits an application for EGF assistance. Expenses incurred by the applicant EU country for preparatory, management, information and publicity, and control and reporting activities relating to such applications must be co-financed at 100% across the EU.  In order to facilitate future evaluations, a beneficiary survey should be conducted after the implementation of each financial contribution from the EGF. The beneficiary survey is prepared by the Commission. As the enterprises are the only ones having access to the contact details of the beneficiaries, they should assist the Commission by sending out to the beneficiaries the invitation to take part in the survey. The Commission should use the collected data for evaluation purposes.  In order to implement this Regulation, in particular the guidance, information, evaluation and information measures, the Commission deems it necessary to raise the ceiling for the technical assistance to 1.5% of the EGF’s maximum annual amount.  2025/0073 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulation (EU) 2021/691 as regards support to workers affected by imminent job displacement in enterprises undergoing restructuring  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular the third paragraph of Article 175 thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 1 ,  Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions 2 ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council 3 established the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) for the multiannual financial framework from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013. The EGF was established to enable the Union to show solidarity towards workers who lost their jobs as a result of major structural changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation.  (2) The scope of the EGF was broadened in 2009 as part of the European Economic Recovery Plan to include support to workers made redundant as a direct consequence of the global financial and economic crisis.  (3) Regulation (EU) No 1309/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council 4 established the EGF for the period of the multiannual financial framework from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020. It also extended the scope of the EGF to cover redundances resulting from any new global financial and economic crisis. Furthermore, Regulation (EU) No 1309/2013 was amended to introduce rules allowing the EGF to exceptionally cover collective applications involving small and medium-sized enterprises located in one region and operating in different economic sectors defined at NACE Revision 2 division 5 level, where the applicant Member State demonstrates that small and medium-sized enterprises are the main or the only type of business in that region.  (4) Regulation (EU) 2021/691 of the European Parliament and of the Council established the EGF for the period of the multiannual financial framework from 1 January 2021-31 December 2027. In order to make the EGF more responsive to the rapidly changing economic challenges in a globalised economy, the scope of the EGF was broadened again to cover any type of large-scale restructuring event, no matter what the cause. A lower threshold better reflects the realities in lesser populated regions. In the light of the twin digital and green transitions, measures that prepare beneficiaries for the twin transition were considered mandatory elements of every coordinated package of personalised measures offered to beneficiaries. Further, the co-financing rates were aligned with the highest co-financing rate of the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+) established by Regulation (EU) 2021/1057 of the European Parliament and of the Council 6 in the respective Member State. Ad d itionally , a mandatory beneficiary survey was introduced .  (5) The main Union instrument to assist those workers that have been affected is the ESF+, which is designed to offer assistance in an anticipatory way . T he EGF is also designed to offer assistance in response to major restructuring events. However, this set-up does not properly reflect the fact that large-scale restructuring events generally take place over a long time period . Member States can use the ESF+ to upskill and reskill workers, but the ESF+ does not provide support for the upskilling and reskilling of workers in emergency situations such as those in which workers affected by imminent job displacement are . T he enterprises where the workers concerned are employed are often in economic difficulty and therefore unable to offer such assistance on their own .  (6) The EGF ’s role continues to be important as a flexible instrument to support workers who lose their jobs in large-scale restructuring events and to help them to find other jobs as quickly as possible. The Union should continue to provide specific, one-off support to facilitate the reintegration into decent and sustainable employment of displaced workers in areas, sectors, territories or labour markets suffering from a shock caused by serious economic disruption. The EU has to ensure its sustainable prosperity and competitiveness while preserving its unique social market economy, succeeding in the twin transition, and safeguarding its democracy , economic security and geopolitical standing . To safeguard the EU’s future as an economic powerhouse, and progress on its twin digital and green transition, it is vital to support workers affected by imminent job displacement in ent e rprises undergoing restructuring so that they can acquir e the skills that would help them transfer into a different role, or to change job.  (7) Therefore it is necessary to amend Regulation (EU) 2021/691 so that the EGF can also offer assistance to workers affected by imminent job displacement in ent e rprises undergoing restructuring . As these workers are still in active employment, their employer may request assistance through the relevant Member States’ authorities. As the EGF is under shared management, it is the Member States’ authorities that can request EGF co-funding upon receipt of a request by an enterprise , provided that the enterprise agrees to provide the national co-funding . Should the financial contribution from the EGF be granted, the Member State concerned should make the funds requested available to the enterprise within two weeks of their receipt. In particular, the enterprise should make available to the Member State all information needed to prepare the final report on the implementation of the relevant financial contribution , not later than six months after the end of the implementation of the assistance. The Commission will prepare a beneficiary survey and the enterprise should share the access to the survey to the workers who participated in the programme .  (8) Given the objective to support workers, the targeted packages supporting workers affected by imminent job displacement have to be designed in a way that excludes any Member State discretion on the eligibility criteria or the selection of beneficiaries. If Member States had discretion as to the use of the EGF resources, in particular as regards the selection of enterprises whose workers would benefit from targeted programmes , EGF resources would be considered as State resources, and therefore should be subject to EU State aid rules.  (9) The support provided to workers affected by imminent job displacement in enterprises undergoing restructuring should take into account existing forms of support available under national measures . Short -time work schemes should not be eligible for EGF support as they do not relate to the displacement of jobs, but to their temporary suspension . If the national measures allow it, the requesting enterprise may subcontract the delivery of the coordinated package of personalised measures, or parts thereof .  (10) The co-financing rate for such measures targeted to workers affected by imminent job displacement in enterprises undergoing restructuring should be equal to the co-financing rate for EGF assistance to displaced workers. Enterp r ises that request EGF support should provide the national co-financing.  (11) The co-financing rate for expenditure incurred by the Member State in relation to applications for EGF support , in cluding the preparation of applications as well as the monitoring and control of the assistance granted, and in relation to information and publicity measures, should be 100%.  (12) As the workers affected by imminent job displacement are still in active employment, only those active labour market policy measures that help them re- or upskill, that give guidance or mentoring, including measures aimed at workers that could envisage starting their own business one day, should be eligible. Therefore, neither allowances, nor start-up grants should be eligible.  (13) Workers affected by imminent job displacement receiving EGF assistance should remain eligible even if their work relationship ends. They should also remain eligible for possible follow-up applications by the respective Member States in support of displaced workers from the same enterprise .  (14) Given the Commission’s increasing tasks in implement ing Regulation (EU) 2021/691 , the Commission should be able to request technical assistance of up to 1.5% of the total annual maximum amount of the EGF. The higher rate is also justified since the EGF’s annual maximum amount was lowered in the context of the multiannual financial framework mid-term revision .  (15) To provide swifter support t o workers affected by imminent job displacement in enterprises undergoing restructuring or workers made redundant and allow them to benefit from Union solidarity in the current context of economic disruptions and rapid changes , there is a need to accelerate the support given to the workers . One way of doing this is by requiring the Commission to request to the European Parliament and the Council to mobilis e the full maximum annual amount at the beginning of each year, if specific conditions are met. The Commission proposal should therefore indicate the circumstances that led the Commission to conclude that the conditions to request full mobilisation of the maximum annual amount , have been met . The Commission proposal should be based on information provided by the Member States at the end of each year. The proposal should include the number of potential applications from each Member State concerned, the sectors of activities concerned, the estimated number of ent e rprises which could request Member States to apply for EGF support, and the estimated number of workers at risk of imminent job displacement or that have been displaced . The identity of the enterprises concerned should not be revealed if the information is not yet publicly known.  (16) Once the full mobilisation of the maximum annual amount is approved by the European Parliament and the Council , the Commission should adopt financing decisions on individual applications and should be required to immediately inform the European Parliament and the Council of the adoption of those decisions. If the full mobilised maximum annual amount is not used by the Commission in a given year, that amount would lapse at the end of the financial year.  (17) The proposed amendments will be fully accommodated with Article 8 of Council Regulation 2020/2093 7 , as well as with point 9 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 16 December 2020 8 .  (18) This Regulation should enter into force as a matter of urgency to swiftly provide support to the workers affected on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union ,  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Article 1  Regulation (EU) 2021/691 is amended as follows:  (1) In Article 1 , paragraph 2 is replaced by the following :  ‘ 2.

FRAMEWORK OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE  1.1. Title of the proposal/initiative  Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) 2021/691 on the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for Displaced Workers and repealing Regulation (EU) No 1309/2013  1.2. Policy area concerned  Employment (Competitiveness and Social Fairness)  1.3. Objectives  1.3.1. General objectives  The EGF is a flexible instrument that allows the EU respond to unexpected events. Since its establishment in 2007, the EGF helps workers that have lost their jobs as a result of economic disruptions.  Under the EGF, the EU provides specific, one-off support in the form of active labour market policy measures to facilitate the reintegration into decent and sustainable employment. This support complements the more anticipatory assistance offered by ESF+.  This proposal aims to extend this assistance to workers affected by imminent job displacement as the consequence of a collective redundancy procedure.  It also aims to streamline and speed-up the mobilisation procedure.  1.3.2. Specific objectives  Specific objective No  (1) The EGF’s objective is to support workers who have been made redundant in major restructuring events that, by their scale and effects, cause a significant impact and to facilitate workers’ reintegration into decent and sustainable employment. Th is proposal will add the objective to also provide assistance to workers who are affected by redundancy in an enterprise under g oing restructuring, to be better prepared to complete a job transition in a shorter time, and to facilitate their transfer into a new role or career.  (2) The EGF’s assistance must be made available more swiftly .  1.3.3. Expected result and impact  Specify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.  Allow a fast and sustainable transition into decent new jobs.  1.3.4. Indicators of performance  Specify the indicators for monitoring progress and achievements.  Indicator 1: Total EGF beneficiaries in a given case  Indicator 2: Beneficiaries by gender (female/male/non-binary)  Indicator 3: Beneficiaries by age group (below 30 years/above 54 years)  Indicator 4: Beneficiaries by education level (with lower secondary education or less/with upper secondary or post-secondary education/ with tertiary education)  Indicator 5: Percentage of EGF beneficiaries in education or training  Indicator 6: Beneficiaries by employment status (unemployed/inactive/employed (dependent)/self-employed).  The indicators do not set a baseline, targets or milestones. The number of targeted beneficiaries as specified by the Member State concerned is not considered a baseline. The reason for this is that some Member States target only workers who have been made redundant and have little chance of successfully moving jobs without tailored support, while other Member States target all workers who have been made redundant.  1.4. The proposal/initiative relates to:   a new action   a new action following a pilot project / preparatory action 9   the extension of an existing action  ⌧ a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action  1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative  1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative  This proposal will enable the EGF to respond to large-scale restructuring events by helping workers who immediately lose their jobs. It will also offer anticipatory help to those who are affected by imminent redundancy.  1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, greater effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this section ’ added value of EU involvement ’ is the value resulting from EU action, that is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.  Reasons for action at EU level  EU involvement through the EGF makes it possible to complement national (both public and private) measures to reintegrate workers who have been made redundant or will be made redundant due to major restructuring events. Experience so far shows that EU involvement makes it possible to provide more tailor-made support for a longer period of time, often involving measures that would not have been provided without EU involvement.  Expected generated EU added value ( ex post )  Attaining a higher reintegration rate of displaced workers than the rate achieved through national support generates volume effects. This means that funding has not only increased the number and variety of services offered, but also the level of intensity of those services.  Improving the public’s perception of the EU.  1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past  See the experience gained under Regulation (EU) 2021/691 as set out in the Explanatory Memorandum of the Proposal for a Regulation.  1.5.4. Compatibility with the multiannual financial framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments  EGF support complements the more anticipatory assistance offered by ESF+.  1.5.5. Assessment of the different available financing options, including scope for redeployment  The impact assessment’s key finding (SWD/2018/289 final) is that as an emergency relief fund, the EGF should remain outside the budgetary ceilings of the EU budget.  1.6. Duration of the proposal/initiative and of its financial impact  ⌧ limited duration  – I n effect until the expiry of Regulation (EU)2021/691   unlimited duration  – Implementation with a start-up period from YYYY to YYYY,  – followed by full-scale operation.  1.7. Method(s) of budget implementation planned 10   Direct management by the Commission  –  by its departments, including by its staff in the E U delegations;  –  by the executive agencies  ⌧ Shared management with the Member States   Indirect management by entrusting budget implementation tasks to:  –  third countries or the bodies they have designated  –  international organisations and their agencies (to be specified)  –  the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund  –  bodies referred to in Articles 70 and 71 of the Financial Regulation  –  public law bodies  –  bodies governed by private law with a public service mission to the extent that they are provided with adequate financial guarantees  –  bodies governed by the private law of a Member State that are entrusted with the implementation of a public-private partnership and that are provided with adequate financial guarantees  –  bodies or persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in the common foreign and security policy pursuant to Title V of the Treaty on European Union, and identified in the relevant basic act  –  bodies established in a Member State, governed by the private law of a Member State or E U law and eligible to be entrusted, in accordance with sector-specific rules, with the implementation of E U funds or budgetary guarantees, to the extent that such bodies are controlled by public law bodies or by bodies governed by private law with a public service mission, and are provided with adequate financial guarantees in the form of joint and several liability by the controlling bodies or equivalent financial guarantees and which may be, for each action, limited to the maximum amount of the E U support.  2. MANAGEMENT MEASURES  2.1. Monitoring and reporting rules  Article 21 of Regulation (EU) 2021/691 requires the Commission to present, every two years, to the European Parliament and the Council a quantitative and qualitative report on the activities carried out under this Regulation. The report focuses on the results achieved by the EGF and in particular contains information on the applications submitted, processing time, decisions adopted, measures funded, including statistics on the indicators set out in Annex II to Regulation (EU) 2021/691, and the complementarity of such measures with measures funded by other Union funds, in particular ESF+, and information relating to the winding-up of financial contributions made.  In line with Article 22 of Regulation (EU) 2021/691, the Commission, in close cooperation with the Member States, will carry out a mid-term evaluation by 30 June 2025 and an evaluation by 31 December 2029. The evaluation will set out recommendations that must be taken into account when designing new programmes in employment and social affairs or the further development of existing programmes.  2.2. Management and control system(s)  2.2.1. Justification of the budget implementation method(s), the funding implementation mechanism(s), the payment modalities and the control strategy proposed  The requirements that apply to management and financial control are laid down in Article 23 of Regulation (EU) 2021/691.  EGF is under shared management. Experience has shown that a tailor-made package of personalised services needs to be designed by the authority closest to the individual concerned. Depending on the Member State and the type of restructuring event, this would usually be a local, regional or national authority. The implementation tasks are therefore delegated to the Member State authorities. The assistance to workers affected by redundancy will further require the involvement of the enterprise undergoing restructuring. EU intervention is needed due to the scale of the impact of the redundancies, but in line with the subsidiarity principle it is limited to what is necessary to meet the objectives of showing EU solidarity with displaced workers.  Given its purpose, which is to provide support in situations of urgency either in an anticipatory or reactive manner, the EGF remains a flexible instrument falling outside the budgetary ceilings of the EU budget.  The mobilisation mechanism is laid down in Article 15 of Regulation (EU) 2021/691. The Commission must pay the financial contribution to the Member State concerned in a single 100% pre-financing payment.  2.2.2. Information concerning the risks identified and the internal control system(s) set up to mitigate them  The risks are those related to shared management of Community Funds. The requirements applicable to management and financial control are laid down in Article 23 of Regulation (EU) 2021/691.  2.2.3. Estimation and justification of the cost-effectiveness of the controls (ratio between the control costs and the value of the related funds managed), and assessment of the expected levels of risk of error (at payment & at closure)  In terms of expected error rate(s), the aim is to maintain an error rate below the threshold of 2%.  2.3. Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities  Member States should prevent, detect and deal effectively with any irregularities, including fraud, committed by beneficiaries. Moreover, in line with Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Council Regulations (EC, Euratom) No 2988/95 and (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) has the power to carry out administrative investigations, including on-the-spot checks and inspections, in order to establish whether there has been fraud, corruption or any other illegal activity affecting the EU’s financial interests.  The European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) is empowered, in line with Council Regulation (EU) 2017/1939, to investigate and prosecute criminal offences affecting the EU’s financial interests as provided for in Directive (EU) 2017/1371 of the European Parliament and of the Council Member States should take the necessary measures to ensure that any person or entity receiving EU funds fully cooperates to protect the EU’s financial interests, grants the necessary rights and access to the Commission, OLAF, the Court of Auditors and, in respect of Member States participating in enhanced cooperation under Regulation (EU) 2017/1939, the EPPO, and ensures that any third parties involved in the implementation of EU funds grant equivalent rights. Member States must report to the Commission any irregularities detected, including fraud, and any follow-up action they have taken in connection with such irregularities and any OLAF investigations. Member States must cooperate with the Commission, OLAF, the Court of Auditors and the EPPO, in line with point (d) of Article 63(2) of the Financial Regulation on all matters related to suspected or established fraud.  3.

NB: In case the Commission proposal evolves considerably during the legislative negotiations, the information laid down in the Legislative Financial and Digital Statement LFDS for any financial and/or digital aspects may need to be updated in order to support the negotiation process and create clarity for all parties concerned.",,,,,,,"The European Commission has proposed an amendment to the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for Displaced Workers (EGF) to extend its support to workers facing imminent job displacement due to enterprise restructuring. Traditionally, the EGF has assisted workers who have already lost their jobs, but this proposal aims to provide early support to those at risk of redundancy. This proactive approach is designed to mitigate the impact of job losses by offering personalized support packages, including education and retraining, to help affected workers transition to new roles or jobs.

The proposal is driven by the need to address economic disruptions, such as those caused by structural shifts in the economy and global challenges, which have led to a rise in job cuts. While the EU has seen significant employment growth in recent years, recent data indicates a reversal, with job cuts surpassing job creations. The EGF, as an emergency response tool, is intended to fill the gap left by longer-term support mechanisms like the European Social Fund Plus, which cannot be quickly reprogrammed to address immediate needs.

To facilitate this support, the proposal includes a streamlined procedure for mobilizing the EGF's full annual budget at the start of each year, allowing for rapid deployment of resources to affected workers. This approach underscores the EGF's role as a reactive instrument to support workers during economic transitions, ensuring they have access to necessary skills and opportunities to maintain employment and contribute to the EU's economic competitiveness.

The proposal does not include co-financing by third parties, meaning the financial responsibility"
