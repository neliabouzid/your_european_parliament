CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  Recent years have witnessed a rise in drug-related violence and criminal activity amongst EU Member States, with illicit drugs like cocaine, heroin, opioids, and amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) posing serious health and security problems. Moreover, the drug market is increasingly marked by the widespread availability of a broader range of drugs, often with higher potency or purity, and in new forms 1 (1) , aided by drug precursors. Drug precursors are chemicals necessary for the illicit production of drugs. However, they can also have significant legitimate use.  In recognition of the need to maintain controls to prevent the diversion of drug precursors towards illicit trade, the UN Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs 2 (2) obliges its Parties to take measures to prevent the diversion of substances frequently used in the illicit manufacture of drugs.  The Union concluded the UN Convention in 1990 3 (3) , and subsequently adopted rules on drug precursors. Currently, the UN Convention is implemented by Regulation (EC) No 273/2004 (‘the Internal Market Regulation’) 4 (4) on monitoring and control ling drug precursors for their possession and placing on the market, and Regulation (EC) No 111/2005 (‘the External Trade Regulation’) 5 (5) , for their trade between the Union and third countries.  These two regulations classify drug precursors as either scheduled (listed and controlled in the regulations) or non-scheduled (for which there are no legally binding obligations). Scheduled drug precursors are classified into several categories 6 (6) depending on their role in illicit drug production and the existing legitimate trade, and thus varying degrees of controls. In addition, in 2013 the provisions granting powers to competent authorities were clarified regarding the possibility to take national measures to control suspicious transactions of non-scheduled drug precursors.  However, the situation has evolved since the adoption of these two regulations, with the rapid increase in designer precursors – drug precursors without any known legitimate use, except research and innovation. Equally, the obligations 7 (7) set out in the regulations create administrative burden across the four categories of scheduled substances. Enforcement measures need to be strengthened in order to ensure the uniform implementation of rules across the EU.  From a security perspective, the proliferation and trafficking of designer precursors present significant challenges to drug precursor control at global level. In response, both the United Nations Commission of Narcotic Drugs (CND) 8 (8) and the International Narcotics Control Board in its 2024 report recommend controlling chemicals that are closely related to controlled precursors – such as families or derivatives of controlled precursors.  In alignment with this strategy, countries like the USA, Canada, Argentina, Mexico and recently China introduced extended scheduling to families or derivatives of controlled precursors. This proactive approach is being followed at multilateral level through the CND 9 (9) . Drug precursor controls are a crucial component of drug supply reduction policy as outlined in the EU Drugs Strategy 2021-2025 10 (10) . The EU Drugs Action Plan 2021-2025 11 (11) further highlights the need to address the challenge posed by designer precursors. Additionally, the 2023 EU Roadmap to fight drug trafficking and organised crime 12 (12) stresses the need to set out innovative ways to speed up and broaden the current approach to regulating drug precursors in response to new methods of illicit drug production.  Protect EU: a European Internal Security Strategy 13 (13) announced a new EU Drugs Strategy and an EU Action Plan against drug trafficking to disrupt routes and business models. The 2025 Commission Work Programme, under its security heading, announced the proposal of new rules governing drug precursors 14 (14) .  Drug precursors are chemicals with an essential role in industries such as pharmaceuticals, flavouring and fragrance, batteries, cosmetics, textiles, oil refinery, water treatment, food additives, explosives, rubber production, fertilisers, plastics or dyes. 15 (15) Within the EU, there were approximately 4 000 active licenses or registrations to trade in drug precursors in 2023 16 (16) . 92 % of these companies are small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) 17 (17) .  Supply chains for these chemicals involve a diverse range of actors, including large-scale chemical manufacturers who produce these substances in bulk for industrial use, as well as specialised producers who create more refined or custom chemical products tailored to specific industrial and research needs. Distributors and other logistics providers play key roles in ensuring that these substances are transported and stored safely. The Union chemical industry is a strategic sector, with 56 % of chemicals going to other sectors. It is therefore vital to simplify conditions to ensure that the legitimate industry is able to fully reap the benefits of the Single Market.  The proposal thus aims to address the challenge of preventing the use of drug precursors in the illicit manufacture of drugs, whilst simplifying rules and procedures for legitimate trade. More specifically, the introduction of specific rules on designer precursors and innovative means for their inclusion will allow quicker action to prevent their diversion. Through digitalisation, several obligations could be automated, leading to a significant reduction in the costs and the administrative burden for operators and the Member State national authorities.  The proposal would contribute towards the objectives set out in political guidelines of the Commission for 2024-2029, which announce the facilitation of business operations, particularly for SMEs 18 (18) , and aim to deepen the Single Market. The Competitiveness Compass emphasizes simplification as a key factor in boosting industry competitiveness. 19 (19)  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  The merging of currently separate instruments for EU internal and external trade will enhance legal clarity and consistency:  • The obligations under the two regulations have been simplified or automated, in line with the digital agenda. This will help reduce the administrative burden for operators and Member State authorities. In addition, a new category has been introduced for designer precursors.  • The inclusion of special rules for designer precursors in the proposal allows for the more effective monitoring and prevention of the proliferation of drug precursors towards illicit aims. Streamlined administrative procedures and a central electronic system will enable greater simplification and reduce overall burden for authorities and business alike, offsetting enforcement and due diligence costs, thereby resulting in a net cost saving. In addition, the drug precursors information repository will provide the necessary guidance to stakeholders.  • Merging the two existing regulations will enable the application of the same rules for internal and external trade, wherever possible.  • Consistency with other Union policies  The proposal is consistent with other Union policies and legislation, namely:  • Regarding illicit drug trafficking, the drug precursors regulations help determine the material scope of minimum national rules on criminal acts concerning precursors set out by Member States in accordance with Council Framework Decision 2004/757/JHA 20 (20) . The EU Drugs Agency (EUDA) plays an important role with its new mandate 21 (21) in the field of drug precursors, and the proposal duly acknowledges its expertise.  • The proposal does not interfere with other rules on chemicals such as the REACH Regulation 22 (22) or the CLP Regulation 23 (23) , or other sectoral chemical legislation such as the Cosmetic Products Regulation 24 (24) or the Detergents Regulation 25 (25) .  • Furthermore, with respect to customs policy, this initiative supports the EU Customs Reform 26 (26) which aims to establish a new EU Customs Authority maintaining an EU Customs Data Hub. The Data Hub will replace the current fragmented customs IT infrastructure in EU Member States, enhancing interoperability with related policy areas. Data on drug precursors will be integrated into the Data Hub.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  The proposal is based on Articles 33, 114 and 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  The Union has shared competence in setting out rules on the control and monitoring of drug precursors within the internal market. The EU set out harmonisation rules on drug precursors since 1990. Two key arguments continue to justify EU action in this field. Firstly, illicit drug production is a Union-wide problem, not confined to a few Member States. EU action is needed to ensure that the efficiency of controls of drug precursors across the Union is not diminished by the existence of diverse national rules with various degrees of strictness, which would inadvertently lead to weaknesses. Secondly, Member States have the obligation to control and monitor transactions with drug precursors, in accordance with the UN Convention. Maintaining harmonised rules would ensure a smooth legitimate trade of chemicals in the single market. EU action would have clear benefits for businesses, national authorities and society as a whole, by empowering national authorities to better fight against illicit drug production, ensuring the good functioning of the internal market and reducing administrative burdens for economic operators and national authorities.  • Proportionality  The proposal does not exceed what is necessary for reaching the objectives pursued. The measures concern a limited number of precursors, thus targeting the controls without unduly hampering legal trade and innovation. The proposal reflects the risks associated with each category of precursors and takes full advantage of digitalisation. It strikes a fair balance between the need to reduce the availability of drug precursors for the illicit manufacture of drugs, and the need to facilitate legitimate trade. Thus, despite a reduction of administrative processes notably on bulk materials with significant legitimate use, the diversion risk is properly addressed by strengthening the enforcement.  • Choice of the instrument  The rules on controls and monitoring of drug precursors are to be set out in a Regulation, and thus directly applicable in all Member States. Drug precursors are often part of supply chains with operators in more than one Member State. The existence of uniform rules will ensure a level playing field among economic operators.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  The 2020 report from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on the evaluation of the EU drug precursor regulations 27 (27) reveals a number of shortcomings that have emerged since the adoption of the Internal market and External Trade regulations, along with possible measures to address them. Notably:  • It underlines the need for action specifically targeting designer precursors. The current rules concern drug precursors where there is evidence of legitimate trade. Also, the current scheduling mechanism, based on a substance-by-substance approach, is too slow in keeping up with the fast pace of innovation by illicit drug manufacturers. There are hardly any limitations to the innovations of the producers of designer-precursors. In other words, each time a new substance is scheduled the criminals will be able to ‘tweak some molecules’ and come up with a new designer-precursor. The time needed for this can be short and in any case is often shorter than the period needed to schedule a new substance.  • Equally, the evaluation also underscores the administrative burden on operators and competent authorities, and the potential digitalisation offers in this regard, such as through e-licencing and the automatic validation through the European Union Single Window Environment for Customs 28 (28) . Further examples of possible reduction of the administrative burden identified a facilitation of trade in low quantities of scheduled drug precursors and the elimination of certain wait periods related to pre-export notifications for external trade.  • Moreover, consideration for the role of online marketplaces in the possible diversion and trafficking of drug precursors would help maintain the relevance of the regulations in the foreseeable future. In addition, the evaluation recommends strengthening the catch-all clause to allow more effective enforcement.  • Stakeholder consultations  The Commission carried out a number of consultation activities to collect evidence and views from a broad range of stakeholders on the problems identified with the Drug Precursors Regulations. Activities included (i) a twelve-week dedicated public consultation concluded in July 2024; (ii) two stakeholder workshops held on 14 November 2023 and 19 September 2024; (iii) discussions with Member States and other stakeholders in the Expert Group on Drug Precursors; and (iv) feedback collected in response to the Commission’s Call for Evidence. As part of the impact assessment study, an external contractor also organised interviews with 78 relevant stakeholders, and two targeted surveys of national authorities and economic operators ran from 25 March to 17 May 2024 and 18 April to 14 June 2024 respectively. Consulted stakeholders included industry associations, economic operators, citizens, and national authorities. Most responses came from a business environment or from national authorities.  National authorities supported strengthening measures to prevent the diversion of drug precursors and, in particular, measures concerning the proliferation of designer precursors. They supported a moderate scope for a ban that would still enable legitimate activities such as research. They noted that this may lead to a higher implementation burden. Economic operators also supported measures in this field but stressed the need for a clear and univocal identification of banned substances (ideally through CAS number or other machine-readable coding) as a prerequisite to avoid undue increase of due diligence costs for legitimate trade. While the consultation activities gave mixed results on current administrative burdens, many stakeholders believed that transitioning to a fully digitalised system would significantly reduce administrative burdens by streamlining processes, improving accuracy, and enabling real-time access to necessary data.  • Collection and use of expertise  Evidence supporting this initiative was gathered from existing documentary sources including legislation and other policy documents, customs and trade statistics, evaluations and reports on relevant policies and information on related initiatives, as listed in Annex 6 to the impact assessment.  • Impact assessment  The Commission carried out an impact assessment on the revision of the Drug Precursor Regulations. The Regulatory Scrutiny Board issued a positive opinion on the draft impact assessment on 6 June 2025. The impact assessment report was revised to take into account the Board’s comments, in particular by better explaining how the uneven implementation and enforcement among Member States is a driving factor behind the problem; the extent to which the existing burdens pose a problem for economic operators and public authorities and why removing some measures would not increase the risks; why the two comprehensive review options are considered to be equally effective in reducing illicit trade and manufacturing; the evidence and methodology used to support the estimates of social impacts; and the key indicators to measure success.  The opinion of the Board as well as the final impact assessment and its executive summary are published together with this proposal. Based on the available information, the impact assessment examined and compared three policy options to address each of the two main problems identified. These policy options were in addition to the baseline option of no change, which would still allow for the inclusion of designer precursors in the scope of the current rules.  Policy option 1:  Policy option 1 aims at assessing the extent to which the current empowerments would be an effective and efficient means to meet the policy objectives of the initiative. The key measures of option 1 that would be underpinned by guidance and transparency measures involving the drug precursors information repository are the following:  • Specific rules for designer precursors in internal trade. Designer precursors rarely enter legitimate supply chains. Yet, their legitimate use in research and innovation, often in very small quantities, needs to remain possible. This is why for internal trade the obligations attached to designer precursors are rendered more targeted. Legitimate use is notified to the competent authority who may then investigate further.  • Simplify reporting obligations by switching from an ex-post to an ex-ante for internal trade: In line with the idea of maintaining high levels of control while streamlining the administrative requirements linked to the controls, this option also seeks to facilitate reporting for economic operators and authorities.  Policy option 2:  Policy option 2 makes use of the wider possibilities provided by a full legislative revision. This enables, notably, a better alignment of external and internal trade controls. The idea of policy option 2 is to gauge to what extent controls of drug precursors trade can be streamlined without compromising their effectiveness. The key measures of option 2 are the following:  • Streamlining and reorganisation of the existing categories of substances: The new set of categories therefore aim to clarify and streamline obligations and controls based on an updated perception of the risk-profile of a group of substances.  • Introducing a new category for designer precursors with an a priori ban: Designer precursors are different from traditional designer precursors in that their legal use is often limited to research activities, but other future legitimate uses cannot be excluded a priori. Use or transactions of such precursors in small quantities for research and innovation should be subject to a prior notification to national authorities, while transactions and use in larger quantities is to be subject to a licence.  • Innovative and more forward-looking ways of scheduling: Option 2 would adapt the rules to the inclusion of groups of substances, for instance based on a chemical base molecule and a limited number of precise modifications to these base molecules.  Policy option 3:  Option 3 is also based on a full legislative revision. Its basic structure is shared with option 2 but it is rather based on the premise of maximising controls. Its key measures are the following:  • Streamlining existing categories of substances and increasing control measures applicable to them: While option 3 also entails a streamlining of categories, the focus is on increasing controls. The aim of extending controls is to have a better overview of legal trade in all precursor substances. This should enable authorities to monitor trade more closely.  • Introducing a new category for designer precursors with a greater focus on ex-ante controls by requiring special licences in all cases.  • Broader approach to innovative scheduling: Option 3 would imply including group of substances with base molecules (represented by their structural formula) and allow for an extended number of modifications to these, resulting in a larger number of substances to be scheduled.  Comparison of the options:  Option 1, while reducing time for scheduling and facilitating knowledge, was expected to fall short of expectations in terms of addressing the proliferation of designer precursors and related social impacts. It was considered to lead to limited burden reduction for internal trade only and have marginal environmental impacts.  Option 3 was expected to largely deliver the same results as Option 2. It was expected to maximise the reduction in the availability of precursors used in the manufacturing of illicit drugs. Given that it would be more costly to enforce due to the larger number of substances to be screened and higher control burdens on legitimate businesses, some Member States did not support excessively broad scheduling of substances as they may not be in the position to cope with the required effort.  Preferred policy option  Policy option 2 is the preferred option 2 as it was considered to be most effective against the proliferation of designer precursors and the trafficking of non-scheduled substances.  In terms of economic impacts, this option and especially the larger scope of substances scheduled as designer precursors is expected to come with an increase of about 10% in enforcement costs. Economic operators would face a one-off cost of about EUR M 7.7 for ensuring that newly scheduled designer precursors are not included in their portfolio. of the measures on designer precursors are offset by the streamlining and simplification of the regulatory framework. Yet, the development of an electronic system provides for the modernisation of the control system, alongside the provisions for digital verification of customers in the internal trade of Category 1 and Category 3 drug precursors. The burden of the EU control system for legal trade is reduced through the lifting/automation of various requirements. Overall, the streamlining and digitalisation of procedures is expected to lead to an administrative burden reduction of EUR M 25.27 per year. These changes should contribute to effectively facilitating trade and promoting the competitiveness of the sector.  For social impacts, the real-time reporting of significant seizures and urgency procedure will reduce significantly the time to detect and respond to new threats, while enabling authorities to target controls more specifically on those substances that are at a higher risk of being used in illegal drug production. Overall, this is expected to help reduce the availability of precursors used in the manufacturing of illicit drugs (especially synthetic drugs). Economic operators’ awareness, and engagement will improve. Indirectly, the initiative should therefore reduce the availability of illicit drugs and may thus contribute to a reduction of social costs caused by illicit drug trafficking and consumption.  No direct environmental effects are expected but an overall reduction of illicit drug production may reduce illegal waste disposal from drug productions sites.  This option is also expected to contribute to the achievement of three of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): SDG #9 ‘Industry, innovation’; SDG #3 ‘Good health and well-being and infrastructure’ and SDG #16 ‘Peace, justice, and strong institutions’.  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  The initiative has a strong simplification dimension. Namely, through:  • A merger of the two regulations into a single regulation, aligning rules for both the internal market and external trade wherever possible.  • Fewer categories of scheduled drug precursors, from 4 to 3. Introducing a specific category for designer precursors provides greater clarity to operators and national authorities alike that such substances are subject to an outright ban. In addition, the initiative includes an exemption to this ban for small quantities for research and innovation. In case a legitimate use for a Category 3 drug precursor is discovered, the Commission and Member States will assess if such a substance should be placed in another category or exempt from the scope of the regulation.  • Due to the risk of diversion, the proposal does not exempt micro enterprises. However, where reasonable the proposal foresees exemptions for small quantities and for pharmacies and veterinary dispensaries .  • From a digital perspective, the development of a central electronic system allows for several improvements:  • Digital applications for licences (new Categories 1 and 3) and registration for external trade (new Category 2).  • Digital controls for imports and exports by the EU Single Window Environment for Customs and the lifting of the Pre-Export Notification (PEN) waiting period.  • Reporting obligations are automated by aggregating the data entered into the central electronic syst e m . The process of verifying customers will be digitalised.  The above should lead to reduced administrative costs for operators and public authorities. The benefits accruing from the consolidation of the two regulations are difficult to quantify since they relate to the time spent understanding the rules and how to comply with them (i.e. they are a complementary action for the compliance with the actual obligations themselves).  The initiative will reduce obligations for certain substances to better facilitate trade (such as in the removal of administrative costs related to the reporting requirement). It will also extend obligations to support enhanced control (i.e., due diligence costs for the implementation of the ban on designer precursors. Globally there will be a net reduction in costs, with the impact assessment estimating this net cost saving as amounting to approximately EUR 25,27 million per year.  • Fundamental rights  The proposal complies with the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. The freedom to conduct business set out in the charter is not absolute. The restrictions set out in this proposal such as requesting a licence for performing activities involving Category 1 or Category 3 drug precursors are justified by the need to monitor activities with such precursors and reduce their availability for the illicit manufacture of drugs. This objective is in line with the general objective of providing a high level of human health protection in the definition and implementation of all the Union's policies.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  Member States and operators will rely on a centralised electronic system that will streamline and support the process for managing licences, registrations, customer verifications, quantity management, and prior notifications. The new rules will eventually remove the periodic reporting obligations for operators and authorities.  Comprehensive digital solutions are expected to facilitate the completion of administrative tasks for operators and to expedite the overall process. Moreover, it will enable competent authorities to verify the legality of drug precursors movements more effectively, improving traceability.  Digitalisation will enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of controls, providing authorities with faster access to structured, high-quality information that allows for automatic checks of licences/registrations and perform quantity management. This will support faster clearance times for imports and exports while strengthening the EU’s ability to detect and prevent illicit trade.  • To achieve this, budgetary needs for the internal market IT system and human resources are estimated to amount to EUR M 1.3 22 , starting from 2028.  • For external trade, a preliminary analysis led to a budget requirements estimation of up to EUR M 24.148 , including human resources, depending on the IT solution delivery model chosen.  • An information repository of drug precursors which will cover all relevant scheduled and non-scheduled substances having or not a known industrial or commercial use which will , including human resources, cost approximately EUR 0.5 30 M.  Further information on these costs can be found in Section 3.2 of the Legislative Financial Digital Statement. The post-2027 figures are indicative, without pre-empting and pre-judging the Commission proposal and the agreement on the next MFF.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  The Commission will evaluate the Regulation 10 years after its entry into application with a view to assessing its effectiveness, efficiency, relevance, added value and coherence. The Commission will submit a report on the main findings to the European Parliament and to the Council.  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  Article 1 defines the subject matter of the Regulation, which is to set out rules for monitoring and controlling drug precursors both for activities in the internal market and for external trade.  Article 2 defines the most important notions used in the Regulation, using whenever possible cross-references from other related Union acts to ensure consistency.  Article 3 defines the material scope of the rules. Drug precursors are to be understood as referring to substances, mixtures, organisms and substances which occur in nature which can be used in the illicit production of drugs. While both scheduled and non-scheduled drug precursors are covered, there are specific conditions in which certain mixtures are excluded from the scope. In addition, the activities of public authorities, such as armed forces or police, acting within the scope of their official duties, as well as the use or possession of drug precursors by pharmacies and veterinary dispensaries are also excluded from the scope, due to the low risk of diversion. Furthermore, while making available on the market, use and possession of medicinal products or veterinary medicinal products are excluded from the scope of the Regulation, external trade is covered only for those products included in Part II of Annex II to the Regulation.  Article 4 includes the standard free movement clause, which will ensure that Member States will not impede making available on the market scheduled drug precursors, if the requirements in the Regulation are fulfilled, by imposing additional monitoring measures, for instance.  Article 5 lists the 3 categories of scheduled drug precursors and sets out the conflict rules to be used to determine the requirements in specific cases where either a substance belongs to two categories, or a mixture contains substances belonging to two or three categories.  Articles 6 to 8 set out the general obligations applicable to operators trading with scheduled drug precursors. Operators have a general obligation of cooperation with national authorities and to keep documentation on their transactions with scheduled drug precursors. To support national authorities in fighting the illicit manufacture of drugs, operators and providers of online marketplaces have the obligation to notify suspicious transactions and significant disappearances or thefts of scheduled drug precursors.  Articles 9 to 14 lay down the requirements for placing on the market, use, possession, import, export or intermediary activities with Category 1 drug precursors. These are the drug precursors with legitimate uses in the chemical industry with the highest risk of diversion. Therefore, they are subject to strict control measures. In addition to the requirement to hold a licence, the operators have to designate a responsible officer, secure premises and trade in the internal market only with operators also holding a licence. Equally, operators using or possessing Category 1 drug precursors also have to keep the documentation, in similar conditions as those for operators trading with any scheduled drug precursor.  Article 15 lays down the requirements for import, export or intermediary activities with Category 2 drug precursors. External traders of Category 2 scheduled drug precursors will no longer need to apply for, and subsequently be granted, a registration for import, export, or intermediary activities. Instead, they will simply register information on their activities, including the estimates of maximum quantities envisaged during a validity period of three years, after which they can start activities involving the scheduled drug precursors they register. This information will be updated as required. Competent authorities may decide to suspend or cease the activities included in the registration in case the conditions declared are no longer fulfilled or in case of suspicion of risk of diversion towards illicit purposes.  Articles 16 to 19 set out the requirements for the newly introduced Category 3 drug precursors concerning designer precursors. Category 3 drug precursors contain substances which have no known legitimate use other than research or innovation at the moment of placing them under control. Therefore, the trade, use or possession of such substances should, a priori , be banned. Transactions, use or possession of small quantities for research and innovation should be allowed subject to a prior notification. If needed in larger quantities or for other legitimate uses, a licence is to be requested.  Articles 20 to 23 lay down procedures related to external trade in drug precursors. The new rules enable the simplification of external trade procedures through automation. Articles 20 and 22 set out the requirements for import and export authorisations, which are replaced by a system of quantity management, whereby the operator notifies the competent authority of the maximum quantity of scheduled substances to be imported or exported over a specific time period. This would also cover one or more intended import or export activities during this time up to a ceiling of the total quantity originally indicated. Article 23 sets out the provision for customs verification, whereby the central electronic system will connect to the Single Window Environment for customs to verify the information provided on intended imports or exports against the operator’s licence, registration, or prior notification details.  Article 21 sets out the process for pre-export notifications, which has been further streamlined. The pre-export notification obligation has been waived for countries in the European Economic Area (EEA). In addition, the 15-day wait period provided to third countries to reply to such a pre-export notification has been lifted.  Article 24 maintains the current provisions that external traders will continue to have the obligation to demonstrate the licit purpose when the scheduled drug precursors are transhipped, placed in temporary storage, or stored in a free zone.  Article 25 sets out a Drug Precursors Information Repository, which is to replace the existing Voluntary Monitoring List. The Repository is to contain information on the scheduled and non-scheduled drug precursors. It has several purposes: to support the operators in identifying suspicious transactions and in determining if specific substances are within the scope of the Regulation in case of including groups of substances identified in a generic way, and to support the Commission and national authorities in identifying the need to place new substances under control. The Repository is to be developed and maintained by the European Union Drugs Agency.  As additional measures to raise awareness and support Member States in the fight against the illicit manufacture of drugs, Article 26 sets out rules on training both for national authorities and operators.  Article 2 7 sets out provisions on mutual assistance between the Member States and between the Member States and the Commission, in particular by recourse to Council Regulation (EC) No 515/97 29 (29) .  Article 28 sets out an obligation for competent authorities to perform controls on the fulfilment of the obligations of this legislation with regard to scheduled drug precursors.  Articles 29 and 30 provide catch-all provisions for drug precursors. Competent authorities are empowered to intervene to avoid diversion towards the illicit production of drugs in the internal market by seizing scheduled drug precursors for a determined period of time in the conditions set out in the national law. For external trade, the powers of customs and competent authorities to monitor and control the possible diversion of both scheduled and non-scheduled precursors are strengthened by enabling Member State competent authorities with the tools to adopt stricter provisions for non-scheduled precursors, such as temporary detention, if they deem necessary. In addition, the requirement of strict control measures for all customs procedures is highlighted.  Article 31 sets out an obligation for Member States to adopt national rules on penalties, to ensure the enforcement of the Regulation.  Article 32 concerns the reporting of information on seizures by competent authorities and customs authorities, while Article 33 sets out specific information obligations for Member States which could lead to future developments as regards substances included in the categories of scheduled drug precursors or in the Repository, as non-scheduled drug precursor.  Article 34 elaborates on the annual reporting obligation to the UN, to be performed by the Commission in consultation with Member States. The existing annual reporting obligations of operators are removed, as automation can provide this information. This allows the reporting obligations as per international obligations to continue with a more sustainable focus of resource utilisation.  Article 35 sets out the main functions of a centralised IT system for drug precursors which is to support the implementation of the various obligations. The system should allow operators to fulfil their obligations laid down in this Regulation and competent authorities, to make their decisions on the implementation of this Regulation and perform their reporting obligations. The system should also facilitate the communication by the Commission of information requested under the UN Convention. The centralised system is to be interconnected with the Single Windows Customs system, to enable the application of a quantity management system and thus replace the existing system of import and export authorisations. In addition, the system could be made compatible with the UN system for reporting of precursors incidents, so that the reporting of seizures in the electronic system is not a duplication of the existing reporting obligation under the UN Convention. The Commission is to adopt an implementing act setting out implementation arrangements for the electronic system, including the technical and the procedural requirements that stem from its functions. Article 36 covers the protection of personal data in the context of the operation of the electronic system.  Article 37 sets out the Commission empowerment for technical adaptations to the Annexes to amend the substances placed under control. In addition, the Commission is to amend other non-essential elements regarding, for instance, licences, registrations, prior notifications, quantity notifications for import or export, reporting obligations or transitional measures.  Article 38 describes the conditions for exercising the empowerment to adopt delegated acts.  Article 39 allows the Commission to use the urgency procedure to adopt delegated acts in duly justified cases, for changes to the controlled substances.  Article 40 ensures that the Commission will follow the examination procedure when adopting implementing acts regarding the implementation arrangements for the IT system.  Articles 41 to 45 refer to final and transitional arrangements. The Commission is to review the Regulation after a period of 10 years of application. This will allow the Commission to also consider the application of the quantity management system in the first evaluation of the Regulation, which is an essential element, and which is applicable only at a later stage when the IT system is fully developed. While Regulation (EC) No 273/2004 and Regulation (EC) No 111/2005 are to be repealed, transitional provisions are also proposed to ensure legal clarity as regards documents issued under the old rules. The application of the new rules should be deferred with 3 years to give the Commission time to develop part of the functions of the IT system to support its implementation and the operators and national authorities time to adapt. Since the other functions of the IT system supporting the quantity management for imports and exports will be operational at a later stage, a dedicated Annex sets out the transitional arrangements for the additional period as regards external trade and the reporting of external traders on their annual transactions.  2025/0384 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  on monitoring and controlling drug precursors and repealing Regulations (EC) No 273/2004 and (EC) No 111/2005  (Text with EEA relevance)  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 33, 114 and 207 thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national Parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 30 (1) ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure 31 (2) ,  Whereas:  (1) The United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances adopted in Vienna on 19 December 1988 ('the UN Convention') is part of the worldwide effort to combat the production and trafficking of illicit drugs. The Union concluded the UN Convention by means of Council Decision 90/611/EEC 32 (3) .  (2) Article 12 of the UN Convention requires the Parties thereto to take the measures they deem appropriate t o p reve n t the diversion of substances which are included in the tables annexed t o the Convention a n d u sed for the purpose of the illicit manufacture of drugs (drug precursors) . T he adoption of rules to monitor and control these drug precursors was implemented in the Union by Regulation (EC) No 273/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council 33 (4) , regarding the control and monitoring measures within the internal market; and Council Regulation (EC) No 111/2005 34 (5) on trade between the Union and third countries.  (3) The Evaluation of the Union drug precursor regulations 35 (6) has shown that additional action with regard to designer precursors is necessary. Designer precursors are substances closely related to controlled drug precursors, with no known legitimate use, and which evade the controls set out in Regulations (EC) No 273/2004 and 111/2005. Those Regulations have been conceived to address the diversion of traditional drug precursors from licit channels towards the illicit manufacture of drugs, and do not include specific rules addressing designer precursors. The evaluation also pointed out to the need to take a holistic approach in regulating drug precursors, to ensure consistency with recent policy developments at Union level against drug trafficking . Recent developments include the EU Drugs Strategy and Action Plan , the adoption of Regulation (EU) 2023/1322 36 (7) on the European Union Drugs Agency, the European Digital Strategy and the adoption of Regulation (EU) 2022/2399 37 (8) .  (4) Drug precursor controls are a crucial component of drug supply reduction policy as outlined in the EU Drugs Strategy 2021-2025 38 (9) . Furthermore, the EU Drugs Action Plan 2021-2025 39 (10) highlights the need to address the challenge posed by designer precursors. Additionally, the 2023 EU Roadmap to fight drug trafficking and organised crime 40 (11) stresses the need to set out innovative ways to speed up and broaden the current approach to regulating drug precursors in response to new methods of illicit drug production. Equally, as part of the new EU Drugs Strategy and EU Action Plan against drug trafficking , announced in Protect EU: a European Internal Security Strategy 41 (12) , the EU will boost operational efforts to stop the inflow of drug precursors , including designer precursors . .  (5) Therefore, new rules on drug precursors should be adopted, to better address the developments in the illicit manufacture of drugs, and in particular, the proliferation of designer precursors . These new rules would also give effect to the obligations deriving from Article 12 of the UN Convention.  (6) In order to streamline current procedures and to reduce administrative burden, Regulation (EC) No 273/2004 and Regulation (EC) No 111/ 2005 should also be merged into one Regulation. That should also facilitate the free movement of chemicals in the internal market. This Regulation should apply without prejudice to other Union legislation applicable to the substances contained in drug precursors covered by this Regulation, such as Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 42 (14) , Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 43 (15) or Regulation (EU) 2019/1148 44 (16) . It should also apply without prejudice to the obligations of Member States to set out national rules on the constituent elements of criminal acts and penalties in the field of illicit drug trafficking in accordance with Council Framework Decision 2004/757/JHA 45 (17) . This Regulation should not apply to customs, police, armed forces and laboratories of competent authorities in the Member States when they are acting within the scope of their official duties, as the risk of diversion of drug precursors in such cases is minimal. The possession and use of drug precursors by pharmacies and veterinary dispensaries within the scope of their regular activities should also be exempt from the scope of the Regulation, as such operators are already subject to strict rules under Union and national legislation. The possibility of setting out simplified formalities for specific external traders , such as pharmacies and dispensaries of veterinary products, should be maintained to reduce the administrative burden for operators with a low risk profile.  (7) Scheduled drug precursors consist of or contain substances covered by the annexes to this Regulation. The annexes should include all the substances already covered by Regulation (EC) No 273/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Council Regulation (EC) No 111/2005 . Such substances are either covered by the UN Convention or are placed under control at Union level, in response to specific risks of diversion identified in the Union. To facilitate their free movement in the internal market and their external trade, harmonised rules should be set out to enable national authorities to control and monitor legitimate trade effectively, with a view to avoiding their diversion towards the illicit manufacture of drugs, without creating disproportionate administrative burdens. As is the case under the current rules, operators should continue to have the obligation to notify suspicious transactions. This is an important source of information for competent authorities to discover illicit activities. The obligation should be extended to significant disappearances and thefts, as such incidents could also indicate possible diversion towards the illicit manufacture of drugs. Similarly, operators should maintain their obligation to keep the documentation regarding transactions of scheduled drug precursors. To increase the possibility for competent authorities to gather evidence concerning illicit activities, the obligation to keep documentation should be extended to operators using scheduled drug precursors of the highest risk and the documentation should be kept for a longer period of time.  (8) This Regulation should lay down specific obligations for online marketplaces with respect to reporting suspicious transactions with scheduled drug precursors that take place on their websites or that use their computing services, once they have become aware of information leading to such a suspicion. The obligations on online marketplaces under this Regulation should not amount to a general monitoring obligation.  (9) Category 1 drug precursors should be subject to strict control rules as they contain substances playing a key role in the illicit manufacture of drugs, but also with important legitimate uses which increases the risk of diversion from licit channels. Operators making available on the market, importing, exporting, performing intermediary activities, possessing or using such drug precursors should continue to be required to hold a licence, as this offers national authorities the possibility to make a thorough check of their legitimate intentions before the activity can be performed. Where fees are levied at national level for obtaining a licence, Member States should adjust such fees in order to safeguard the competitiveness of small and medium -sized enterprises within the meaning of Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC 46 (18) . The existing obligation of operators to verify that their customers also hold a licence should be maintained, as it proved to be an efficient way of verifying the reliability of such customers. However, the obligation to obtain customer declarations should no longer be maintained, as it leads to administrative burden without clear benefits in terms of facilitating the identification of suspicious transactions. It is also important to maintain the existing obligation of operators trading in Category 1 drug precursors to secure premises, and to extend it to operators using such drug precursors, given their high risk of diversion.  (10) Category 2 drug precursors are precursors which, even though frequently used in the illicit production of drugs, are traded in significant quantities in the internal market and external trade and have extensive legitimate uses . While the risk of diversion is significant, strict control measures would be very cumbersome both for the industry and for the national authorities, with limited added value for the identification of suspicious activities. Therefore, the control and monitoring measures under this Regulation should be focused only on the external trade. To reduce the administrative burden, obligation s for external trader s should be limited to registering their activities, without the requirement of approval by national authorities.  (11) Category 3 drug precursors should be introduced to address the particularities and high risks for use in illicit drug production associated with designer precursors, which play a significant role in the illicit manufacture of drugs, as demonstrated by their high proportion in the number of seizures in the recent years, and do not have any known legitimate use other than research and innovation. Such precursors do not follow the traditional pattern of diversion from licit channels towards the illicit manufacture of drugs. In support of the fight against the production and trafficking of illicit drugs, it is therefore important to ban them from: being made available on the market; import; export; intermediary activities; and the ir use or possession.  (12) However, as Category 3 drug precursors can be used in research and innovation and other legitimate uses may be discovered after the inclusion of various substances in the annex to this Regulation, it is important to set out rules allowing operators to perform activities with such precursors. Should small quantities of designer precursors be needed for research and innovation, operators should be required to file a prior notification to the competent authority in the Member State where they are established. That will encourage research and innovation by not imposing costly and lengthy formalities for transactions of low quantities and therefore low risk. Should operators need Category 3 drug precursors in higher quantities or for legitimate purposes other than research and innovation, they should then be required to obtain a licence in accordance with the provisions for Category 1 drug precursors, as the risks are similar.  (13) As new designer precursors can be easily created by modifying the chemical structure of substances placed under control, it is important that this Regulation is adapted to cater for the introduction of both a list of substances identified individually and of groups of substances identified in a generic way in Category 3 drug precursors. Whenever a group of substances is included in a generic way, an exemption list should be provided to exclude individual substances that are part of this group but for which a legitimate use other than research and innovation has been identified and which are not included in either Category 1 or Category 2 drug precursors.  (14) The requirement for obtaining import and export authorisations should be removed and replaced by quantity management, comprising quantity notification by operators and automatic verifications by customs authorities for import and export. That should reduce the administrative burden for ex ternal traders , whilst at the same time maintaining strict controls of drug precursors entering or leaving the customs territory of the Union and ensuring continued fulfilment of the UN Convention by the Union and its Members States.  (15) In accordance with Article 12(10) of the UN Convention, the effectiveness and practicability of pre-export notifications is fully recognised. However, exports to non-Member States participating in the Union Single Market and exports to countries where an international agreement waives the pre-export notification, should be exempt from the pre-export notification obligation .  (16) To enforce this Regulation effectively, it is important to enable competent authorities to request proof of licit purposes for drug precursors entering the customs territory of the Union.  (17) It is essential to step up efforts for raising the awareness of legitimate operators to the risks associated with non-scheduled precursors, to support them in identifying suspicious transactions and notifying them on voluntary basis. Thus, extensive information on drug precursors, including non-scheduled ones, and a tool to help determine the scope of scheduled designer precursors, will be made available through a Drug Precursors Information Repository.  (18) The Drug Precursors Information Repository should be developed, maintained , and kept up to date by the European Union Drugs Agency and should replace the existing Voluntary Monitoring List. The Repository should contain comprehensive information on scheduled and non-scheduled drug precursor s , and their legitimate and illicit uses , to support operators in identifying suspicious transactions and Member States and the Commission in identifying new trends in the illicit production of drugs.  (19) Member States should organise regular training to raise awareness on the risks of diversion of drug precursors and the significant role which operators can play in the fight against the illicit manufacture of drugs.  (20) Mutual assistance between Member States and between Member States and the Commission should be reinforced, in particular by recourse to Council Regulation (EC) No 515/97 47 (19) .  (21) To prevent the diversion of drug precursors towards the illicit manufacturing of drugs, national authorities and customs authorities should be empowered to seize and confiscate both scheduled and non-scheduled drug precursors, if there are reasonable grounds or evidence that the drug precursor is intended for illicit use.  (22) To ensure the correct application of this Regulation, Member States should lay down rules on penalties applicable for infringement of this Regulation, which should be effective, dissuasive and proportionate.  (23) The annual reporting obligation for operators should be removed, as it has not been proven to be the most efficient measure in the identification of suspicious activities, while being very burdensome for the industry. Instead, the efforts of national authorities should be increased in reporting, without delay, significant seizures of drug precursors. This would ensure that national authorities from other Member States can better target their controls.  (24) Following the Union’s obligations of reporting in Article 12(12) of the UN Convention and Resolution s of the United Nations Economic and Social Council 1995/20 on measures to strengthen international cooperation to prevent diversion of substances included in table I of the UN Convention and used in the illicit manufacture of stimulants and other psychotropic substances and 49/3 strengthening systems for the control of precursor chemicals used in the manufacture of synthetic drugs, the Commission should draw up an annual report to be sent to the International Narcotics Control Board.  (25) A centralised electronic system should be established to digitalise all the procedures set out in this Regulation. The system s hould allow operators to fulfil their obligations laid down in this Regulation and competent authorities to make their decisions on the implementation of this Regulation and perform their reporting obligations . The system should also facilitate the communication by the Commission of information requested under the UN Convention. The enforcement of drug precursors entering or leaving the Customs territory of the Union under this Regulation should be facilitated by the interconnection between that electronic system and the ‘EU Single Window Environment for Customs’. In addition, the Commission should explore with the United Nations to possibly interconnect the electronic system with the United Nations system for the reporting of incidents with precursors or other tools, to avoid double reporting and facilitate the international cooperation. The A gency should have access to the information in the electronic system to facilitate the implementation of its mandate under Regulation (EU) 2023/1322 and the development and updat e of the Drug Precursors Information Repository.  (26) Any processing of personal data under this Regulation should be carried out in compliance with the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 48 (20) or Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 49 (21) of the European Parliament and of the Council, within their respective scope of application.  (27) In order to amend certain non-essential elements of this Regulation, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission to add or remove substances from the c ategories of drug precursors , where necessary as a matter of urgency . Given the particularities of designer precursors which are close chemical relatives of scheduled drug precursors and can be easily created, the Commission should have the possibility to add designer precursors also by including groups of substances, identified in a generic way and, where needed, to exclude individual substances part of such groups which have legitimate uses other than research and innovation and which are not to be included in a different category. However, the Commission should not add groups of substances in Category 1 or Category 2 drug precursors, unless this is necessary to fulfil the obligations under the UN Convention. In addition, the Commission should be empowered to amend non-essential elements set out in the annexes concerning licences, registration s , prior notification s , quantity management related to import and export, pre-export notification s , demonstration of licit purposes, determining the criteria for suspicion on intention of use in the illicit manufacture of drugs , transitional measures and reporting. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during the preparatory work for the adoption of delegated acts, including at expert level and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making 50 (22) . In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States’ experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.  (28) Implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission in order to determine the implementing arrangements for the electronic system. These arrangements should include technical requirements and procedures for the implementation of the main obligations set out in this Regulation, such as obtaining a licence, filing a registration or prior-notification, or those linked to quantity notification and customs verification. These arrangement s should also include the rules for the protection, safety and security of personal data. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Counci l 51 .  (29) Since the objectives of this Regulation cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the international and changeable nature of the trade in drug precursors, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in third paragraph of Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not exceed what is necessary for reaching those objectives. This Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised, in particular, by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.  (30) Regulations (EC) No 273/2004 and 111/2005 should therefore be repealed.  (31) The application of this Regulation should be deferred with the time needed to establish the electronic system needed for its implementation.  (32) Transitional arrangements should be set out to ensure the validity of documents issued under Regulation (EC) No 273/2004 and Regulation (EC) 111/2005 and to allow for the connection of the electronic system for competent authorities and customs systems, to guarantee legal certainty and ensure a smooth transition towards the new rules ,  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Chapter 1 General provisions  Article 1  Subject matter  1. This Regulation establishes harmonised rules for the monitoring and control of the making available on the market , import, export, possession, and use of drug precursors and of intermediary activities involving drug precursors with a view to ensuring their free movement in the internal market and preventing their availability for the illicit manufacture of drugs.  2.

Title of the proposal/initiative  Regulation of the European Parliament and Council on monitoring and controlling drug precursors and repealing Regulations (EC) No 273/2004  1.2. Policy area(s) concerned  Internal Market  Customs Union  External Trade  1.3. Objective(s)  1.3.1. General objective(s)  There are two general policy objectives to be pursued when revising the regulations:  Objective 1: to reduce the availability of drug precursors for illicit drug manufacturing  Objective 2: to facilitate legitimate trade and use of drug precursors, both in the Internal Market and in relation to external trade  1.3.2. Specific objective(s)  Specific objective SO No 1.1 - To establish more effective and rapid control measures to address designer precursors  The aim of SO 1.1 is to ensure that rules do not only address traditional drug precursors but also newly emerging designer precursors, for which a global approach is crucial.  Specific Objective 1.2 – To address gaps and shortcomings that hamper the implementation and the functioning of the control system  SO 1.2 is to improve the regulations by filling in identified gaps and clarifying existing provisions to provide for a uniform application across the EU and enhance cooperation between authorities as well as with businesses.  Specific objective 2.1 – To simplify, modernise and streamline the EU provisions for legal trade  SO 2.1 is about removing unnecessary obstacles and administrative burdens for legal trade in drug precursors.  1.3.3. Expected result(s) and impact  Specify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.  For Objective 1, Member States and operators will have to implement a new ban on designer precursors, that are chemically viable and easy to use, identified with sufficient precision to allow operators to conduct due diligence checks on their portfolios. For Member State authorities, the ban entails an extension of the scope of existing control and monitoring rules.  Other measures include requiring online marketplaces service providers to notify suspicious transactions, disappearances and thefts.  National authorities and customs authorities are being empowered to seize and confiscate both scheduled and non-scheduled drug precursors, if there are reasonable grounds or evidence that the drug precursor is intended for illicit use. In the internal market, Member States remain competent to adopt national rules to investigate such cases, and no additional requirements should be set out in this Regulation.  Ultimately, the measures are aimed at reducing the supply of illicit drugs with corresponding indirect effects on drug consumption, public health, and crime, even if this is not directly measurable.  For Objective 2, Member States and operators will rely on a centralised EU portal that will streamline and support the process for managing licences, registrations, customer verifications, import/export quantity management, and prior notifications. The new rules will also eventually remove periodic reporting obligations for operators and authorities.  Comprehensive digital solutions are expected to facilitate the completion of administrative tasks for operators and to expedite the overall process. Moreover, it will enable competent authorities to verify the legality of drug precursors movements more effectively, improving traceability.  From a customs perspective, digitalisation will enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of controls, providing authorities with faster access to structured, high-quality information that allows for automatic checks of licences/registrations and perform quantity management. This will support faster clearance times for imports and exports while strengthening the EU’s ability to detect and prevent illicit trade.  1.3.4. Indicators of performance  Specify the indicators for monitoring progress and achievements.  Indicator linked to objective 1:  A substantial reduction of availability of precursors for illicit drug manufacturing, based on the annual volume of seized scheduled precursors (2 100 incidents, corresponding to approximately 541 tonnes of precursors seized in 2023, reporting based on the EU database of drug precursors). Previous interventions lead to a reduction of about 60 %.  Indicator linked to objective 2:  A reduction of net administrative burdens for businesses of EUR M 19.84, down from a baseline of annual recurrent costs of EUR M 32.34. This is to be verified by an evaluation no later than 10 years after the entry into application of the revised rules.  1.4. The proposal/initiative relates to:  ☑ a new action  ☐ a new action following a pilot project/preparatory action 59 (1)  ☑ the extension of an existing action  ☐ a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action  1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative  1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative  The new rules for the internal market for drug precursors will start applying to economic operators and national authorities 2 years after the adoption of the new rules.  Amongst others, they concern the ban of designer precursors, the need for prior notifications and the verification of customers.  Experience with developing the system of past projects of integrating certificates in the EU CSW-CERTEX, shows that a period of three years after entry into force of the implementing acts is required to specify, develop, test and deploy the connection of the central e-licensing solution with quantity management, after which three years are needed for the EU CSW-CERTEX interconnection with the national customs systems.  The digitalisation of the supervision of imports, exports and licit trade of drug precursors will replace current procedures, some of which remain paper-based. It will enable a swift and secure electronic communication between actors: economic operators, their customers, competent and customs authorities in Member States.  Once the electronic system has been developed and deployed by the Commission, Member States Customs authorities are expected to connect to it via the EU Customs Single Window – CERTEX (EU CSW-CERTEX).  Competent authorities for single market matters will connect through another affiliated IT system. The IT system for formalities in the internal market will be operational 2 years after the entry into force of the regulation. The Commission will explore how existing IT systems with a similar purpose could be re-used, such as, for instance, the Single Market Compliance Space (SMCS), or the software used for the Digital Waste Shipment System (DIWASS) which will be used for the exchange of documents and information as of 21 May 2026. The DIWASS should be interoperable with other systems and software that are used by some competent authorities or economic operators, as set out in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2025/1290.  Budgetary needs for the internal market IT system managed by GROW are estimated to amount to EUR M 1.070 starting from 2028.  To proceed with the preparations for an electronic system for the control of trade in drug precursors, financial and human resources need to be allocated to TAXUD as soon as possible, starting from 2025. A preliminary analysis based on the possible re-use of the Commission’s electronic licensing systems and building on experience from other e-Licensing systems and the EU Customs Single Window, led to a budget requirements estimation of up to EUR M 25, depending on the IT solution delivery model chosen, for a period from 2025 to 2034(including time dedicated to the preparation of the Implementing Act). The subsequent yearly maintenance cost of the digitalisation of controls at the external borders is estimated at EUR M 0.5. The EUDA will deliver an information repository of drug precursors which will cover all relevant scheduled and non-scheduled substances having or not a known industrial or commercial use which will cost approximately 0.182 M. For the current MFF, the need for additional resources (one contractual agent post) for EUDA will be covered by a contribution agreement to be financed from the existing envelope of the Customs Programme (DG TAXUD) up to and including 2030. The funding for a second additional FTE as of 2028 until 2030 will be covered by the amounts in the EU Facility otherwise foreseen to fund actions in the domain of Home Affairs.  Overall, the digitalisation part of this initiative is aligned with the EU digital strategy to increase the efficiency of public services, improving the quality of communication with economic operators.  1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, greater effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this section 'added value of EU involvement' is the value resulting from EU action, that is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.  Reasons for action at EU level (ex-ante):  The two current EU drug precursors regulations set the rules for the legitimate trade of chemical substances, respectively within the EU and with third countries, that can also be used in illicit drug production. The monitoring and control of trade between the EU and non-EU countries falls under a policy area where the EU has exclusive powers and, therefore, the subsidiarity principle does not apply.  For the internal market, any changes to the scope or requirements of such rules must be made at EU level to avoid: (i) distorting the market; (ii) creating barriers to the free movement of products; or (iii) undermining efforts to prevent diversion of drug precursors.  Expected generated EU added value (ex-post):  EU action would have clear benefits for businesses, national authorities and society as a whole, by simplifying licit trade flows between legitimate businesses within the single market and third countries, and by supporting the fight against illicit drug production. This will also remove unnecessary administrative burdens and reduce those that are necessary for supervising trade flows, such as licenses, registrations or prior notifications.  By ensuring uniform rules instead of 27 different sets of rules and procedures, EU action strengthens the competitiveness of EU businesses.  A fully digitised environment also offers advantages such as an increased effectiveness and speed of controls.  1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past  The evaluation of EU rules on drug precursors (Regulation (EC) No 273/2004 and Council Regulation 111/2005) found several shortcomings, especially concerning designer precursors (drug precursors with no known legitimate use except research and innovation).  Equally, it highlighted opportunities to simplify the complex legal framework and improve procedures for legitimate trade of drug precursors, thus reducing administrative burdens.  From an enforcement perspective, it demonstrated possibilities for quicker action from Member States, based on a more uniform application of rules.  Experience has shown that industry and Member States authorities need sufficient time to familiarise themselves with new requirements and to adapt their business processes accordingly.  Developing the IT system of past projects of integrating certificates in the EU CSW-CERTEX, shows that a period of three years after entry into force of the implementing acts is required to specify, develop, test and deploy the connection of the central e-licensing solution with quantity management, after which three years for the EU CSW-CERTEX interconnection with the national customs systems are needed. The synergies with the existing e-Licensing platforms are key, using a comprehensive online platform for processing applications and issuing licences, brings further harmonisation of the applied procedures. It is however to be noted that the drug precursors project presents certain particularities when compared to existing systems, and this will have to be reflected in its architecture.  1.5.4. Compatibility with the multiannual financial framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments  Synergies are expected through an improvement in the enforcement of rules on illicit drug trafficking and a stronger cooperation with the EU Drugs Agency (EUDA). Scheduled drug precursors are part of the material scope of minimum national rules on criminal acts concerning precursors set out by Member States in accordance with Council Framework Decision 2004/757/JHA on combatting drug trafficking. By extending the scope of substances scheduled, the application of the Framework Decision is expected to be strengthened.  The initiative also reduces administrative and reporting requirements for economic operators and national authorities.  1.5.5. Assessment  The costs incurred between 2025 and 2027 for DG TAXUD will be covered by the Customs programme. The amount of around EUR M 1.3 will be financed by the financial envelope allocated to the Customs programme under the Commission’s MFF 2021-2027. The next financial envelope allocated to the Customs programme in the next MFF should cover the remaining costs of fully digitalising the drug precursors domain. The costs depend on the IT solution delivery model and might be up to additional around EUR M 24 (see below tables). That amount, estimated in the period 2028-2034, is subject to the revision of the related rates of the new DG TAXUD framework contracts that will be revised presumably in 2028. In addition, from 2035 onwards, an annual maintenance fee for this system of EUR M 0.5 should be foreseen. The post-2027 figures are indicative, without pre-empting and pre-judging the Commission proposal and the agreement on the next MFF.  For the internal market aspects of the proposal, no costs will be incurred under the current MFF.  1.6.

Comments  [...]  2. MANAGEMENT MEASURES  2.1. Monitoring and reporting rules  The impact of the initiative will be assessed through its evaluation which is planned no later than 10 years after the entry into application of the revised rules.  The centralised electronic system will allow for an efficient and continuous monitoring of operational activities. Most notably, it will harmonise the annual reporting requirements to the UN on legal trade and incidents related to drug precursors.  In addition, the Commission and to some extent EUDA will continuously monitor the application of the rules and the developments in precursor trade that may warrant an adaptation of the scope of the measures.  2.2. Management and control system(s)  2.2.1. Justification of the budget implementation method(s), the funding implementation mechanism(s), the payment modalities and the control strategy proposed  The Regulation establishes new substantive requirements with regard to controlling the licit trade of drug precursors while ensuring fair competition among market actors in the internal market.  These new rules require an improved digital system for monitoring and controlling the internal and external trade of drug precursors. The enforcement and successful implementation of the new Regulation is estimated to require an additional FTE in the European Drugs Agency (EUDA) that will be financed under the contribution agreement between DG TAXUD and EUDA up to and including 2030  2.2.2. Information concerning the risks identified and the internal control system(s) set up to mitigate them  The risks associated to the financial transactions implementing the central electronic system are limited.  The specifications, development and operations of the central electronic system are implemented using existing framework contracts and/or via co-delegation to other Commission services.  GROW: N/A  2.2.3. Estimation and justification of the cost-effectiveness of the controls (ratio between the control costs and the value of the related funds managed), and assessment of the expected levels of risk of error (at payment & at closure)  The costs of controls are negligible compared to the appropriations for the development of the IT tool itself  GROW: N/A  2.3. Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities  The measures implemented by the Commission will be subject to the ex-ante and ex-post controls in accordance with the Financial Regulation. Contracts and agreements financing the implementation of this Regulation will expressly entitle the Commission, including OLAF and the Court of Auditors to conduct audits, on the spot checks and inspections.  3.

Requirements of digital relevance  The effects of simplification of the legal framework, digitisation of processes and streamlining of obligations should contribute to positive impacts related to Objective #2, the facilitation of trade (and competition). Processes should be more efficient, there are fewer obligations to comply with overall.  Where currently Regulation (EC) 273/2004 requires verification of customer declarations through, in practice, paper-based procedures (since stamped copies of declarations are required), this measure would ensure a digital solution for the verification of customers trading in drug precursors internally. The digital solution would be an off-the-shelf digital solution, which provides for secure electronic interactions across the EU between businesses and public authorities.  The obligations would be significantly streamlined for operators, with negligible implications for control overall, and significant savings for both public authorities and economic operators. Obligations that can be digitalised become digital, and those that (due to a centrally - EU - developed and digital solution) can be automated, are removed for operators. The solution would need to have the necessary functions listed in the Table below, including the requirements for customer verification (i.e., it allows for mutually recognised digital signatures, exchanging, and storing of documentation, etc.)  The proposed requirements would be driven by a centralised system connected with customs IT solutions via EU CSW-CERTEX to allow cross-check and availability check of license and/or registration for import or export transaction and quantity management. As such, the most significant work to establish the digital solution would be borne by the European Commission. Economic operators and Competent authorities responsible for the registration of operators and issuance of licences will use the central solution. With the digital solution, the EU eLicensing central portal for licenses and registrations would be connected to the EU Customs Single Window Certificates Exchange System and would contain information on substances, validity, quantity and whether exemptions apply, meaning that the authorisation process could be automated. Customs authorities of Member States stand to implement and interconnect the central solution with their national export and import systems once the processes are digitised.  The requirements of digital relevance are listed in the table below:  Table: Row 1 — Reference to the requirement; Requirement description; Actor(s) affected or concerned by the requirement; High-level Processes; Categories Row 2 — R1: Article 35(2), point (a)(i); Access to the digital solution for operators (legal entities) legally trading with DP and public authorities; Economic operators, online market places, competent authorities, Commission; Management of registries; Digital Public Service, Digital Solution, Data Row 3 — R2: Article 35(2), points (a)(ii), (iii) and (iv); Submission of licence application, registration or prior-notification by economic operators; Economic operators, competent authorities, Commission; Filing an application or notification; Digital Public Service.

Security and privacy:  As personal information will be stored in the central data base, compliance with the data protection legal acts is a must. Ownership of information remains at any time at national level, while ensuring strong security of information. The information to which each user/system will get access will be based on a strict need-to-know policy.  Openness and transparency:  The availability of all data is foreseen for validity check of license, self-registration and prior notification by trade partners of operators. The information will be available on a need-to-know basis as users will be assigned access to the database based on the credential provided by trader to its trade partner (by using QR code or eWallet). Transparency, harmonisation, and cross-checks of licences/registration will be ensured by the centralised repository storing the related information accessible to the authorities involved in the process.  Alignment with the EU Customs Data Model  The interaction with customs systems will be ensured by the compliance with the EU Customs Data Model (EUCDM). The data in scope and content is information related to the export and import of the goods. It will be available in the Commission Implementing Act, the specification of data requirement of every data field relevant for external trade will be described in the Delegated Regulation. The EU Customs Data Model is fully aligned with European Data Strategy.  User-centric, data-driven, agile  The data exchange is organized around the registration and licenses and related documents for the purpose of cross-border collaboration.

The solution will have a significant impact on the following stakeholders: · Economic operators involved in external trade in drug precursors , who apply for licences electronically via the new system. · EU Member States competent authorities who receive applications for and issue licences · EU countries’ customs offices who control customs declarations of drug precursors and verify the relevant licences electronically. The European Commission, which is responsible for the development and maintenance of the system, ensuring its functionality and compliance. The EU countries are responsible for connecting their national customs systems to the EU CSW-CERTEX, which in turn ensures connection to the central solution.;  Row 4 — Measures taken to ensure a shared understanding of the data Please list such measures; - Data management will prioritise usability, reliability, and security, and support agile updates to meet evolving legal and operational requirements. The system will be aligned with the EU Customs Data Model (EUCDM) to ensure full interoperability with customs IT systems and compliance with EU customs legislation. Data elements required for import and export procedures will be harmonised and incorporated into future amendments to implementing and delegated regulations related to external trade in drug precursors.; - Row 5 — Use of commonly agreed open technical specifications and standards Please list such measures; - Interoperability with customs systems such as EU CSW-CERTEX and TARIC is foreseen.; -  Describe the digital public service(s) affected by the requirements  The solution needs to be consistent with the EU Customs Single Window Digital Framework Policy. Where relevant, national single window systems would be connected to the EU Customs Single Window Certificates Exchange System, which in turn would be connected to the EU web portal for EO drug precursor procedures. Interoperability with international IT solutions such as PEN online could be ensured by the elaboration of the necessary technical specifications and the compliance to them. A machine-to-machine interface for communication with third countries authorities would facilitate the cross-border collaboration and administrative cooperation. MSs could access and see the messages such as PEN notifications received from third countries’ partners in a web-based interface.  In line with the recommendations of the F4F Platform, Member States are requested to report incidents once only and in real-time through the EU. To avoid a duplication of reporting requirements an IT solution that allows for an exchange with the current UN alert system (PICS) would be required . If possible , the platform should communicate with INCB’s PICS to avoid ‘double reporting’ burden and ensure consistency in the data gathered at EU and international level. MS will have to upload the information in the EU system, and such system could transmit the information to PICS.  The digital solutions could ensure interoperability across domains, including between the EU DP solution and customs systems for trade formalities and the reporting requirements of the international control system (e.g. PEN online, Form D, etc.).  The Interoperable Europe solutions identified for (re)use:  -  Interoperability with MSs national customs IT solutions should be ensured in line with rules and agreements on personal data processing and control.  As regards the possible interoperability of the new system with the solutions of the INCB who is responsible for the building of IT application of United Nations the EU signed the UN convention with elements of international cooperation in the area of preventing diversion of drug precursors. If applicable, the UN therefore should ensure compliance of its systems to the GDPR rules and conditions of SLA agreements allowing EU authorities to perform the work without delay. The centralised solution will ensure that the issued and electronically submitted certificates are available to customs authorities for cross-checks 24/7 (classified as “Silver” CI), hence not depending on non-synchronised working hours. No remaining barriers to cross-border interoperability are detected at the moment.  Interoperability with other customs systems such as the TARIC, EORI, CRMS etc. is envisaged.  4.5. Measures to support digital implementation  High-level description of measures supporting digital implementation  Table: Row 1 — Description of the measure; Reference(s) to the requirement(s); Commission role (if applicable); Actors to be involved (if applicable); Expected timeline (if applicable) Row 2 — The Commission shall adopt implementing acts establishing common technical specifications for the electronic system; Art. 35(7), Art. 37; Commission to adopt the act; Member States; 18 months after entry into force of the basic act. Row 3 — Committee procedure; Art. 35(7); The Commission shall be assisted by a committee. That committee shall be a committee within the meaning of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011.; The Commission; committee; Member States; 18 months after entry into force into force of the basic act.  The list of business functionalities is at high level and purely indicative at this stage and will be fine-tuned in context of the business analysis and inception phases, supported in part by the COM IT governance (Business Case and Project Charter), and to be legally covered in the dedicated Implementing Act for the external and international dimensions of the initiative.  Depending on the decision of ITCB 77 on the alternatives for development of the solution and delivery model, The Commission will chose between outsourcing the work to an external contractor or developing in-house (e.g. by DG GROW/DG SANTE/DG Trade etc).  As a first activity related to the development of the DP Licencing system and based on the experience gained from other EU projects for the issuance of digital certificates, a prototype for the issuance module shall be prepared, followed by a piloting activity. The Commission will organize a Conformance tests (CT) campaign in cooperation with MSs. All necessary information and documentation for the CT campaign (Integration Guide for Member States, CT Plan, CT Organization Document) will be provided and organizational meetings will be organized prior to the campaign.  To ensure the smooth implementation of the requirements, the Commission will:  - Create a dedicated team to manage the specifications (functional and technical ones) and the implementation of the system, facilitating the collaboration between all stakeholders.  - Create guidelines for the implementation (functional and technical specifications) of the needed services for interaction with the DP eLicencing system by the EU MSs.  - Develop and maintain the common components of the system needed for the issuance and the exchange of certificates with a central repository, and an administrative cooperation.  - Extend the functionalities of EU CSW-CERTEX for the new domain of drug precursors and interaction with the EU MS National customs systems.  - Maintain (in technical means) a central registry of authorised users, including EOs of EU MSs and partner countries.  - Extend the existing platforms used in the EU for the authentication, authorisation and connection of users from the international partners.  - Provide the relevant guidelines (i.e., user manuals, GUI help desk procedures, and training materials) for the DP eLicencing system GUI.  - Discuss, elaborate and provide the needed information guidelines (e.g., specifications, connectivity instructions, training materials) to international partners to be connected via machine-to-machine interface such as INCB.  - Provide trainings for the users of the system, including operators, officials of MS medicine and customs authorities.  - Provide the GUI (user interface) of the system in all EU languages. The platform will be able to support other languages for the future needs, apart from Latin and Cyrillic alphabet  - Provide a centralised 3rd level IT support in English.  The central support from EC will be provided only to national service desks of customs authorities, not for businesses. Technical Support will be provided by DG DIGIT. After the adoption of the proposal by the Commission the process of interinstitutional negotiations between co-legislators will start. In parallel with this process the responsible body in charge of digitalisation will start business analysis in order to compose Project Initiation Request and Business Case for submission to ITCB.

This initiative addresses the growing challenges posed by drug-related violence and the emergence of more potent drugs. The regulation focuses on substances that, while having legitimate industrial uses, can be diverted for illicit drug production. A key component of the proposal is the creation of a Repository managed by the European Union Drugs Agency (EUDA). This Repository will gather information on both scheduled and non-scheduled drug precursors, aiding operators in identifying suspicious transactions and assisting authorities in deciding whether to regulate new substances.

The proposal underscores the importance of digitalization in reducing costs and administrative burdens for the chemical industry, a crucial sector in the EU. It requires operators involved in the market, import, export, and intermediary activities with scheduled drug precursors to maintain detailed commercial documents for each transaction. Additionally, the proposal includes provisions for training national authorities and operators, promoting cooperation between member states, and enhancing the powers of customs and competent authorities to monitor and control precursor diversion.

Operators must request updates to their licenses if they plan to exceed estimated quantities, handle new substances, undertake additional activities, or change business premises. Competent authorities may update licenses based on documentary checks, and decisions to refuse, revoke, or suspend licenses will be communicated electronically and are subject to appeal under national law. External traders are required to register information, including contact details, Economic Operators Registration and Identification (EORI) numbers, and details of responsible officers"

CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  This legislative proposal puts forward amendments to the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR – Regulation (EU) 2019/2088) 1 . The SFDR was adopted on 27 November 2019 and has been in application since March 2021. It represents one of the first pieces of the EU Sustainable Finance framework and is part of a broader package of sustainability disclosure rules, tools and standards for non-financial and financial companies adopted pursuant to the Commission’s 2018 Action Plan on Financing Sustainable Growth 2 .  The SFDR is a disclosure framework which sets detailed sustainability disclosures for financial intermediaries and financial products regarding how they consider various environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors. Its objective is to increase transparency, combat greenwashing and protect investors by ensuring that information in this respect is disclosed to investors by financial market participants such as asset managers and pension providers, and by financial advisers. More broadly, the SFDR thus contributes to the aims of: (i) helping to attract private funding to facilitate the transition towards greater sustainability; and (ii) helping European companies to seize competitive opportunities in this area.  The SFDR is complemented by a Commission Delegated Regulation 3 which lays down detailed disclosure rules for how financial market participants and financial advisers should disclose sustainability information towards investors about their investment activities and their financial products in order to help the latter make informed choices. The Delegated Regulation specifies notably the details of the information to be disclosed to investors in pre-contractual documents, on websites and in periodic reports both for financial market participants as entities and for the financial products which they make available.  For entity-level disclosures, financial market participants and financial advisers are required to explain how they integrate ESG considerations into their internal procedures, including their due diligence processes and consideration of responsible business practices. For product-level disclosures, including for investment funds, insurance-based investment products and pension products, they are required to disclose sustainability characteristics and objectives. Article 8 of the SFDR establishes that, for products that promote environmental or social characteristics, financial market participants must show how they promote such environmental and social characteristics. Article 9 of the SFDR establishes that, for products that have a sustainable investment as their objective, financial market participants must explain the sustainability objective and show how the objective is attained. Finally, all products in the scope of the SFDR are subject to the disclosures under Article 6 of the SFDR, according to which financial market participants must disclose how sustainability risks are integrated in the investment decision process when relevant, as well as the results of the assessment of the likely impacts of sustainability risks on the returns of the products.  Since its inception, the SFDR has had broad-reaching effects on the market, accompanying a stead il y increasing demand for financial products with ESG characteristics. Products disclosing under Articles 8 and 9 of the SFDR account for almost 50% of EU Assets under Management (AuM), representing more than 60% of EU funds 4 . Europe is by far the largest market for such funds, accounting for up to 84% of global sustainable fund assets 5 .  The comprehensive assessment of the SFDR undertaken by the Commission under Article 19 of the Regulation since 2023 has however identified several shortcomings that have emerged since its entry into application. The evidence gathered showed that while the objectives of the SFDR remain broadly supported, several aspects of the rules are considered complex, difficult to implement, and ineffective. Problems of misalignment between concepts and definitions in the SFDR and in other EU sustainable finance legislation, coupled with challenges for financial market participants to access reliable and comprehensive ESG data, have contributed to the complexity of the framework. Evidence shows that the objective of investor protection has not been sufficiently well served, compounded by the misuse of Articles 8 and 9 as quasi-labels and the lack of clarity regarding certain concepts and obligations.  The review of the SFDR is included among the simplification initiatives in the 2025 Commission Work Programme 6 . In line with the Political Guidelines for 2024-2029 7 , the objective is to stay the course on the goals set out in the European Green Deal, but with simpler rules, lower administrative burden and better enforcement. The need for simplification of the sustainable finance framework to lower compliance costs for companies in the EU was also highlighted in the Report on ‘The future of European competitiveness 8 ’ by Mario Draghi.  Against this background, the Commission proposes to review the SFDR to make it more efficient, simple and proportionate. Key in this effort is ensuring the integrity of the EU single market for sustainable finance by focusing on requirements which mitigate risks of greenwashing and better help investors seize and compare opportunities in sustainability-linked financial products. At the same time, the review aims at boosting the competitiveness of Europe’s financial sector by ensuring conditions which make business easier and deepening the single market for sustainability-linked financial products, thus helping to allocate capital for Europe’s sustainable prosperity.  The proposed changes pursue two objectives. The first is to simplify and reduce the sustainability-related administrative and disclosure requirements for financial market participants and financial advisers, as well as to enhance the coherence of the framework for the operational needs of financial market participants. The second is to improve end-investors’ ability to understand and compare sustainability-linked financial products, and to protect them against potential misleading ESG claims.  The present proposal therefore puts forward a considerable simplification of reporting requirements, and a three-way categorisation of financial products with ESG features, incorporating wide stakeholder feedback and building on current market practices. The proposal also makes targeted consequential amendments to Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 on packaged retail and insurance-based investment products (PRIIPS) 9 and repeals Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288 10 , implementing the current SFDR , as of the date of application of the new framework.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  The SFDR is closely linked with other pieces of the sustainable finance framework, including the EU Taxonomy 11 , the EU Benchmarks Regulation 12 , the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) 13 , the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) 14 , as well as relevant parts of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) 15 , , the Insurance Distribution Directive (IDD) 16 and the Shareholder Rights Directive (SRD) 17 . Together, they support companies and the financial sector in mobilis ing private funding into sustainable projects and technologies. In particular, reporting obligations for financial market participants under the SFDR build on the reporting obligations for companies under the CSRD and the Taxonomy Regulation. The review of the SFDR is thus necessary to reflect the changes introduced by the proposed ‘Omnibus’ 18 simplifications regarding sustainability information from companies, in particular the future scope of the corporate disclosures from companies under the CSRD.  The review also builds on the guidelines by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) on funds’ names using ESG or sustainability - related terms 19 . For the purposes of ensuring that ESG claims under the revised SFDR are clear, fair and not misleading, financial market participants should also consult supervisory guidance prepared by the European Supervisory Authorities 20 . Moreover , the notion of ESG-related claims made by financial products regarding how and the extent to which categorised products invest in or contribute to either transition or sustainability objectives, or integrate sustainability factors in their investment strategy beyond sustainability risk management considerations, is consistent with the notion of ‘environmental claims ’ under Article 2(1)(o) of Directive 2005/29/EC (Unfair Commercial Practices Directive , as amended by Directive (EU) 2024/825 as regards empowering consumers for the green transition 21 ) . Consistent with Article 3(4) of Directive 2005/ 29/EC , requirements under th at Directive would be met by proper application of the requirements of this Regulation.  Finally, given that this Regulation adapts the information requirements related to the degree to which financial products invest in sustainability-related activities, including activities that contribute to an environmental objective as set out in Article 9 of the Taxonomy Regulation, the requirement for financial market participants to disclose the information under Articles 5 to 7 of the Taxonomy Regulation is henceforth no longer a blanket obligation but flows from whether and the extent to which they choose to use the Taxonomy Regulation in this respect. Further, the references in those Articles of the Taxonomy Regulation would no longer refer to paragraphs involving disclosures under Article 8 and 9 of the SFDR, but to criteria for sustainability-related product categories, and are thus also moot. Likewise, there is no longer an obligation for these disclosures to mention the statements referred to in Articles 6 and 7 of the Taxonomy Regulation regarding the shares of financial products that take and do not take into account EU criteria for environmentally sustainable economic activities under that Regulation.  • Consistency with other Union policies  As mentioned above, the SFDR review is a simplification initiative in the 2025 Commission Work Programme and part of the follow-up to the Draghi report. The proposed changes aim to facilitate the implementation of the sustainable finance framework . Consistent with the broader simplification agenda and the objective of delivering simpler rules through better implementation under the S avings and I nvestments U nion , the Commission has published a list of non-essential level 2 measures which includes the repeal of several level 2 measures stemming from the SFDR. 22  The updated rules will also address current barriers to the cross-border distribution of financial products with sustainability features which impede the potential of the single market in sustainable finance from effectively mobilising savings towards Europe’s sustainable prosperity. The new rules should therefore promote a more effective functioning of the single market for sustainable finance, including by improving transparency and empowering investors across the Union to participate in EU capital markets in line with the objectives of the Savings and Investments Union 23 .  In the same spirit of the recently published initiatives to advance the S avings and I nvestment s U nion, such as the recommendations on the Savings and Investment Accounts (SIAs) 24 , the SFDR is also aimed at supporting measures to create better financial opportunities and financial outcomes for citizens who wish to invest . It is specifically designed for individuals looking to grow their savings by investing in financial markets in alignment with their sustainability preferences . In addition, the Commission’s strategy on financial literacy, aimed at helping citizens better understand investment principles, opportunities and risks 25 , will allow citizens and investors to get a greater understanding of the economic effects of choosing to finance certain activities, as well as their impacts and implications for employment, sustainability, social outcomes and resilience.  The review will contribute to the objectives of the European Green Deal in a more efficient way, including climate neutrality under the Climate Law 26 , the environmental transition supported by an innovative and circular economy, and the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  Finally, the SFDR review builds on the guidance from the Commission on the application of the EU sustainable finance framework regarding the defence sector, presented in the Communication on a European Defence Industrial Strategy 27 and delivered through the June 2025 Defence Readiness Omnibus 28 , which was announced in the March 2025 Joint White Paper for European Defence Readiness 2030 29 . It is therefore fully consistent with the objectives of the Joint White Paper and the Defence Readiness Roadmap 2030 30 to further bolster access to finance for the defence and space sector.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  The legal basis of the review is the same as the existing Regulation (EU) 2019/2088, meaning Article 114 of the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which allows the adoption of measures for the approximation of national provisions having as their object the establishment and functioning of the internal market. The revised rules help underpin the effective and efficient functioning of the internal market for sustainable finance, safeguard competition between different financial market participants and incentivise behavioural changes toward greater innovation.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  This proposal complies with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). The need for a coherent common framework for sustainability-related disclosures for financial products across the EU was established as part of the original SFDR. The objectives remain fully valid and enjoy broad stakeholder support. Without effective Union-level action, the problems identified since the entry into force of the Regulation would persist and would not be tackled in an effective, efficient and coherent way. Financial market participants and investors would continue to face undue complexity in the application of the rules. Excessively lengthy disclosure rules and templates involving sustainability characteristics in the business practices of financial market participants, as well as in the financial products they offer to investors, would remain in place. Uncertainty and insufficient comparability would continue to mark the availability of ESG financial products, negatively impacting their credibility and uptake.  Given the problems outlined above, the necessary simplification and adjustment of the existing SFDR framework can only be implemented in a coherent and effective way at EU level. This effective EU-level action would also help scale up private sustainable finance across the Union, boost the proper functioning of the single market for sustainable finance and ultimately contribute to improving transparency for investors to enable their participation in EU capital markets, in line with the objectives of the Savings and Investments Union.  • Proportionality  The proposed amendments respect the principle of proportionality, as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). They do not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives of simplification, transparency and investor protection, while achieving the scaling up of private sustainable finance in support of Europe’s sustainability and competitiveness goals. In addition, based on the proportionality principle, the present proposal builds on market practices.  • Choice of the instrument  This proposal amends Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 via an amending Regulation. A directly applicable regulation, providing full harmonisation, is needed to address market fragmentation and reduce the scope for additional national rules to tackle perceived shortcomings and ensure the desired simplification of requirements and disclosures, for the benefit of both financial market participants and investors, in a harmonised way throughout the Union.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  In December 2022, the Commission announced a comprehensive assessment of the SFDR framework. Two consultations were issued (one public and one targeted) running from September until December 2023.  The assessment served to gather feedback on the functioning of the framework and assessing any shortcomings with regard to how well it is achieving its ultimate objectives. In particular, this concerned how the rules were working in terms of helping to attract private funding to facilitate the transition of the European economy towards greater sustainability and, as part of this, empowering investors to better understand and compare the products on offer.  The assessment and its various steps, outlined in the next section, were recapped in an evaluation of the SFDR, carried out as part of the impact assessment accompanying this proposal (see under ‘Impact assessment’ below). The evaluation results help identify and confirm the key problem drivers, and inform the lessons learned for the review.  • Stakeholder consultations  The following section provides an overview of the stakeholder consultations carried out for the review:  – Targeted and open public consultations  – Technical workshops and roundtables  – Commission expert group opinions (Platform for Sustainable Finance – PSF)  – Input from the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs)  – Engagement with Member States  – Continuous engagement with experts  – Call for Evidence  Targeted and open public consultations  Two public consultations ran from September to December 2023 (targeted 31 and open 32 ). A summary report 33 was published in May 2024.  324 organisations and individuals participated in the targeted consultation. Financial market participants and financial advisers made up the largest group of respondents, followed by NGOs. Respondents were predominantly from EU countries. Respondents from non-EU countries were mostly from the UK and the US.  The responses showed significant support for the SFDR policy goals but mixed views on how the implementation of the regulation delivered against its specific objectives. The majority of respondents agreed that the SFDR was currently not being used solely as a disclosure framework as intended, but also as a labelling and marketing tool (in particular the disclosures under Article 8 and 9). Many also highlighted that inconsistencies between different parts of the sustainable finance framework pose challenges for both financial market participants and end investors and queried whether the SFDR is the right place to set entity-level disclosure requirements to inform investors. Most respondents called for the disclosures and sustainability-related concepts to be simplified and made more meaningful for investors.  The majority of respondents supported setting up an EU categorisation system for ESG financial products, focused on retail investors, accounting for the international investments of EU financial products, and leveraging existing market practices.  Technical workshops and roundtables  To complement the replies to the targeted and open consultations, the Commission held four technical workshops to gather further technical comments. The workshops took place in October and December 2023, and in January 2024. An additional technical roundtable was conducted with consumers’ associations in December 2024 to analyse the existing EU consumer testing studies on retail investors’ sustainability preferences and understanding.  PSF opinions  The Platform for Sustainable Finance (PSF), a Commission expert group, submitted input in two opinions . The first, from December 2023 34 addresses the main questions raised by the Commission in the targeted consultation. In December 2024, the PSF published a second opinion 35 , outlining how a categorisation system for sustainable finance products could be set up and calibrated, with a proposal to set up three categories (called ‘sustainable’, ‘transition’ and ‘ESG collection’). The opinion covered the current state of ESG financial markets and the potential impact that setting certain thresholds could have on current products falling under Articles 8 and 9 of the SFDR.  Input from the ESAs  The European Supervisory Authorities delivered in June 2024 a joint opinion on the assessment of the SFDR 36 where they suggested to set up new categories, a ‘sustainable product’ category and a ‘transition product’ category. ESMA published its own further opinion “ Sustainable investments: facilitating the investor journey ” in July 2024 where among other things it strongly encouraged the establishment of a categorisation system 37 .  Engagement with Member States  The European Commission engaged with Member States in the context of the Member State s Expert Group 38 in two meetings (December 2024 39 and June 2025 40 ), requesting their feedback and comments. The Commission also received numerous letters and position papers from Member State authorities and National Competent Authorities (NCAs) presenting their views on the review of the SFDR.  Continuous engagement with experts  The European Commission engaged continuously with experts such as financial market participants, investors, NGOs, consumers’ associations, trade associations, academics and other interested stakeholders, on key challenges with the current SFDR and on how to set up categories.  Call for Evidence  Finally, the Commission gathered feedback during the Call for Evidence which ran from 2 May to 30 May 2025 41 . 195 stakeholders submitted their views. The largest group of respondents were businesses associations and companies, followed by NGOs, and to a lesser extent, national authorities. Respondents were predominantly from EU countries, with France, Germany, Belgium, Italy and Netherlands being the most represented.  • Collection and use of expertise  In addition to the feedback collected above, the Commission reviewed several studies and additional data sources, from both stakeholder and academic sources, including the study requested by the ECON Committee of the European Parliament on “the current implementation of the SFDR” 42 , quoted in the impact assessment accompanying the proposal.  Material used to prepare the impact assessment and inform policy choices comes from diverse market participants and stakeholders, as well as other reputable and well-recognised sources. Findings were cross-checked across different information sources to avoid biases caused by outliers or vested interests.  • Impact assessment  An impact assessment was carried out to prepare this legislative proposal. On 2 July 2025, the impact assessment report was examined by the Regulatory Scrutiny Board (RSB). Following a first negative opinion, the Board issued a positive opinion with reservations on 8 October 2025.  In its comments, the RSB notably requested that the policy options should be better specified to allow for an adequate assessment and comparison, that the option of repealing the SFDR should be fully assessed alongside other options, that the coherence with the simplifications under the Omnibus proposals should be better established, and that the feasibility of creating reliable categories should be better evidenced including given challenges with ESG data availability impacted by the Omnibus. A more detailed description of what the policy options would concretely look like was thus added, mainly by providing illustrative details for the future streamlined disclosures, to be further specified in implementing measures, and more detailed criteria for the three proposed categories. A full analysis of the repeal option was added, along with further analysis to demonstrate the steps needed in the review to ensure coherence with the Omnibus. Further evidence was added on the feasibility to set ESG disclosures that would be meaningful and would be based on broadly available, comparable and credible sustainability information which responds to investors’ demand. Finally, the analysis of costs, benefits and savings was further substantiated to support the above, based on data which was available and reliable. The policy options explored in the impact assessment aim at defining the essential features of the disclosures and categories for the revised Regulation , clearly framing the limited areas for supplementary rules needed in future implementing measures . Besides coherence between the SFDR and the rest of the sustainable finance framework, including the changes entailed by the Omnibus in terms of sustainability disclosures applicable to corporates, an important consideration was recognising and building upon current market practices, to ensure a sufficient degree of continuity with appropriate criteria in the categorisation of products that are already being applied by markets, namely building on the ESMA fund name guidelines 43 .  To achieve the objectives set for the review, the preferred options were assessed to be:  (i) deleting disclosures at entity level regarding principal adverse impacts, largely cancelling out the costs associated with entity-level disclosures (25% of the overall costs linked to the disclosures, saving an annual total of EUR 56 million in recurring costs), and removing any duplication between the SFDR and CSRD;  (ii)  significantly reducing product-level disclosures, refocusing on templates for categorised products with fewer sustainability indicators, facilitating comparability and investors’ decisions, and considerably cutting the recurring costs linked to product disclosures;  (iii) setting up 3 categories for ‘sustainable’, ‘transition’, and ‘ESG basic s ’ products 44 , covering a significant share of today’s ESG financial products, ensuring a coherent set of EU rules for all ESG-focused products toward which end-investors interested in sustainability could be directed by distributors ( under subsequent changes to the delegated acts under MiFID and IDD ) . While some initial one - off costs from the creation of product categories are anticipated, recurring costs are expected to be lower than those of the current SFDR in the longer term and, overall, are offset by the savings achieved by the other elements of the review.  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  The combination of the preferred options has the potential to considerably simplify and improve the efficiency of the legislation. The proposal is directly relevant for SMEs who represent the majority of financial market participants in scope. Well over 25% of the estimated costs for SMEs with the current rules (about EUR 163 million of annual recurring costs, of which about EUR 43 million are for entity-level disclosures and EUR 120 million for product level disclosures) are expected to be reduced. The reduction of entity-level costs in the present proposal is certain with only minimal one-off costs, and while sufficient data could not be gathered on costs associated with the creation of product categories, it can be expected that more than 50% of product-level costs can be saved thanks to the significant reduction of product-level disclosures. In addition, SMEs would benefit more than proportionally from simplification as pronounced cost digression effects are observed, i.e. in relative terms SMEs incur much higher costs than larger firms due to certain minimum efforts that are necessary to build and maintain sustainability-related disclosures.  SMEs are also indirectly affected as investees, as they can, together with the safeguards of the Omnibus (value chain cap), benefit from the flow of funds and be included in products under a simple categorisation system.  In conclusion, the reduced administrative requirements linked to the removal of entity-level disclosures eliminates burdens estimated to account for 25% of the costs under the current rules, largely incumbent on financial market participants which are SMEs. In addition, the simplification of product-level disclosures and introduction of product categories building on market practices, which overall are expected to allow cost savings, are estimated to facilitate further overall burden reduction for SMEs toward the 35% target.  • Fundamental rights  The proposal promotes rights enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights (the ‘Charter’). It integrates due consideration for the respect of human rights, gender equality, fair and just working conditions and prohibition of child labour by companies (Articles 5, 23, 31 and 32 of the Charter), a high level of environmental protection (Article 37 of the Charter) as well as social cohesion (Article 36 of the Charter) and consumer protection (Article 38 of the Charter) since its main objective is to protect the integrity of the EU single market for sustainable finance by ensuring requirements which mitigate risks of greenwashing, and to better help investors seize opportunities in sustainability-linked financial products.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  The proposal does not have a budgetary impact for the Commission.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  The Commission will monitor the implementation of the changes proposed in the Regulation through established processes underway in particular with the European Supervisory Authorities and the Platform for Sustainable Finance (PSF).  Three years after the entry into application of the Regulation, the ESAs and the NCAs would be tasked to survey and assess the implementation costs linked to the new categorisation system. The Commission could also work with the ESAs to conduct regular assessments of occurrences of greenwashing and supervise sustainability-related claims, and with the PSF to conduct a targeted analysis of the regime and assess the degree of uptake of the categorisation system and the implementation of simplified disclosures. Finally, the Commission would work with the ESAs and consumer associations to measure consumer satisfaction a few years after the implementation of the regime.  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  Article 1 introduces the following amendments to Regulation (EU) 2019/2088:  (1) Changes to the subject matter (Article 1 SFDR) to reflect the revised scope focused on financial market participants who manufacture, make available or manage financial products (i.e. removing financial advisers who do not carry out this activity from the scope) and including the creation of categories for sustainability-related financial products .  (2) Consequential changes to some definitions , including notably the deletion of financial advisers and the addition of definitions for categorised ‘sustainability-related’ products as well as those categorised pro ducts claiming to achieve ‘impact’ as part of their strategy (Article 2 SFDR) .  (3) Deletion of Article 2a SFDR on the empowerment for ESAs to develop regulatory technical standards to be adopted by the Commission regarding the principle of do no significant harm , consistent with the list published by the Commission of implementing measures considered non-essential (‘de-prioritisation list’) 45 .  (4) Amendment of Article 3 to re flect removal of financial advisers from the scope .  (5) Deletion of entity-level disclosure requirements in Articles 4 and 5 regarding, respectively, principal adverse impact s and remuneration policies , also consistent with the de-prioritisation list .  (6) Amendment of Article 6 to re flect removal of financial advisers from the scope .  (7) Addition of new Article 6a on specific transparency restrictions for non-categorised products, as a result of the creation of categories for ‘sustainab ility-related financial products’ . Notably, to protect investors, non-categorised products, while not prevented from including information in the ir pre-contractual and periodic d isclosures on whether and how th ey consider sustainability factors, are required to ensure that such information is not a central element of those disclosures and do es not constitute sustainability-related claims reserved for categorised products.  (8) Creation of categories for financial products with transition (Article 7), ESG basic s (Article 8), or sustainable features (Article 9) , including the main criteria for financial products to qualify in each category, th e exclusions which products in each category should not invest in, and the information to be disclosed to investors . The revised Articles also repeal the previous empowerments, in accordance with the de-prioritisation list. The order of the revised Articles re flect s continuity with the existing usage of, notably, Articles 8 and 9 as shorthand for products with different environmental and social features.  (9) Addition of new Article 9a on financial products investing in or combining categorised products , to clarify when these products are e l i gible to meet the criteria of a given category , and to set out transparency rules for how non-categorised financial products which invest in categorised financial products , but not in the amounts which would qualify those products as categ orised themselves, should disclose information about those investments . N otably , such products should set out what share of their investments are in categorised financial products , relying on the information regarding the latter provided by financial market participants in the investment chain .  (10) Amendment of Article 10 on website disclosures by financial market participants , reflecting the revised sco p e , the creation of categories for ‘sustainability-related financial products’ , and consistent with the de-prioritisation list .  (11) Amendment of Article 11 on periodic disclosures by financial market participants on an annual basis , reflecting the revised scope, the creation of categories for ‘sustainability-related financial products’, and consistent with the de-prioritisation list .  (12) Change to Article 12, to re flect removal of financial advisers from the scope .  (13) Addition of a new Article 12a setting out principles for financial market participants on the use of data and estimates for the purposes of this Regulation as well as rules on the information to be provided to investors upon request on relevant data source s and assumptions underpinning estimates .  (14) Amendments to Article 13 on marketing communications and naming rules, notably reflecting the revised scope, the creation of categories for ‘sustainability-related financial products’, and consistent with the de-prioritisation lis t . Namely, sustainability -re lated claims in names and marketing communications would only be allowed for categorised products, w ith the exception of non-categorised products under Article 9a that would be able to make such claims in marketing communications but not their names . In addition, amendments to Article 13 incorporate disclosure requirements from Regulation (EU) 2024/3005 for financial market participants that include ESG rating s in their marketing documentations, ensuring that information on such ratings is available as part of the website disclosures.  (15) Amendment of Article 14 to reflect the revised scope and preclude additional national level requirements in order to avoid that these would go beyond information requirements and criteria for ‘sustainability-related financial products ’ in th e revised Regulation and cause fragmentation in the internal market .  (16) Change to Article 15 to reflect the revised scope .  (17) Addition of o ptional exemptions in Article 17 for specific types of products , notably of the closed-end ed type created before the entry into application of the revised Regulation as well as a clarification that the creation of categories for ‘sustainability-related financial products’ is without prejudice to labelling schemes with additional features in terms of transparency , governance and other requirements .  (18) Revision to Article 18 (reporting by ESAs) to reflect the revised subject matter and scope of the Regulation .  (19) Consequential targeted changes to Article 18a (European single access point) .  (20) Changes to the review clause (Article 19) to reflect the revised subject matter and scope of the Regulation .  (21) Addition of new Articles 19a , 19b and 19c (transitional provisions for insurance and pension products which are n ot affected by the ESMA fund name guidelines , and Commission empowerment s to specify the conditions for investments to contribute to given transition-related or sustainability-related objectives or to integrate sustainability factors for the categorisation of financial products as sustainability-related products , and the disclosure requirements for these categorised financial products via delegated acts ) .  Article 2 amends Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 notably by specifying disclosures to be included in the key information document for sustainability-related products to indicate which category they fall under.  Article 3 repeals Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288, containing implementing measures adopted under the current SFDR, as from the date of application of the revised Regulation.  2025/0361 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 on sustainability-related disclosures in the financial services sector (SFDR), Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 on key information documents for packaged retail and insurance-based investment products (PRIIPs) and repealing Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288  (Text with EEA relevance)  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 46 ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) The March 2018 Action Plan on Financing Sustainable Growth 47 set out a series of steps to help mobilise private capital toward s more sustainable economic practices and improved sustainability-related risk management in the financial sector , in the wake of , notably, the Paris Agreement 48 on climate change and the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 49 . Among the ensuing actions, the Commission proposed, and co-legislators a dopted Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 of the European Parliament and of the Council , 50 to improve transparency on the consideration of sustainability risks and factors by financial market participants in financial services and financial products offered to investors.  (2) The Communication on the European Green Deal 51 recalled the importance of ensuring the mobilisation of private finance towards the obj ective of transforming “ the EU into a fair and prosperous society, with a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy where there are no net emissions of greenhouse gases in 2050 and where economic growth is decoupled from resource use ” . The steps taken pursuant to the Green Deal have consistently affirmed the important role of private finance in helping to achiev e climate neutrality by 2050 in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 of the European Parliament and of the Council 52 , specific sectoral sustainability targets in th at context 53 , and the objectives of the REPowerEU plan 54 to accelerate the development of secure and sustainable energy in the U nion and reduce dependency on imported fossil fuels . Commission analyses ha ve consistently highlighted the magnitude of investments needed to achieve the EU’s climate objectives: over the 2030 – 2050 period, approximately EUR 650 b illio n (in 2023 EUR) will have to be allocated yearly for the transition of the energy system alone across a variety of scenarios. In that context, u nlocking and facilitating sustainability-oriented priv ate f unds is critical for the Union to properly contribute financially to the New Collective Quantified Goal set at COP 29 and the additional climate finance goal to mobilise USD 1 , 3 t rillio n a year from 2035, to boost its resilience in the face of climate change 55 and to support the plan for EU competitiveness and decarbonisation ( The Clean Industrial Deal ) 56 . It is also aligned with efforts to bo ost the defence industry of the Union 57 by ensuring that the sustainable finance framework does not prevent capital from be ing directed towards defence-related activities , and help contribute to deliver ing a more integrated single market for savings and investments to support economic growth , innovation and competitiveness in the Union 58 .  (3) Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 has been instrumental in improving transparency as regards the opportunities and risks in investments supporting or integrating diverse sustainability-oriented aims and considerations . Financial market participants have a common set of principles and requirements for the provision of sustainability-related information regarding financial products and services they offer. R egulation (EU) 2019/2088 benefitted i nvestors in terms of a more structured framework for how th at information is presented to them, helping competition, choice and comparability between financial products and services with sustainability-related features and aims , even if not to the full of its potential . National competent authorities in charge of monitoring compliance of financial market participants with the requirements of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 have set up practices in relation to risks of greenwashing and developed a more common supervisory framework for their oversight.  (4) Regulation (EU) 2019/2088, however, has been marked by implementation challenges both for financial market participants and for investors. A comprehensive assessment under Article 19 of the Regulation has found that, while its objectives remain broadly supported, the Regulation’s implementation is associated with considerable complexity and cost s for financial market participants . In addition, the information provided to end-investors has not, on the whole, been sufficiently clear and effective in helping those end-investors understand and compare diverse sustainability-related financial products and services offered to them. Disclosures to investors under Articles 8 and 9 of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 have also been used by the market in a misleading way to categorise financial products as sustainable despite the lack of criteria that could fit this purpose . D isclosures under th o se Articles have also been marked by varying interpretation s and implementation practices , which led to in sufficient clarity for end- investors. In addi tion, diverging interpretations by national competent authorities also emerged and supervisory practices and expectations have been impacted by the need to adapt to the introduction of new common guidelines for the use of environmental, social and governance terms in the names of investment funds (“ESMA guidelines on funds names”) 59 . Th o se implementation challenges have led to undue costs and burdens for the financial sector of the Union compared to international competit ors, to a lack of investor protection and risks of greenwashing, and to differing national requirements and supervisory practices that are at odds with the integrity of the single market. Overall, the challenges are seen to limit the effectiveness of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 in exploit ing the potential of the single market to mobilise and allocate private finance for the sustainable prosperity of the Union .  (5) Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 is part of the wider sustainable finance framework, elements of which are undergoing targeted amendments to simplify , streamline and reduce the burden of sustainability-related disclosures and requirements on U nion undertakings . Th o se amendments should ensure a more cost-effective delivery of the overall ambition of the European Green Deal while not undermining its agreed policy objectives 60 . As part of that wider sustainable finance framework, Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 should also be reviewed commensurately . Th at is why its revi sion has been included among the simplification initiatives of the Commission in the Mission Letter to the Commissioner for Financial Services and the Savings and Investments Union 61 and in the 2025 Commission Work Programme 62 . The objectives of the revi sion are to overcome the shortcoming s associated with the implementation of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 , to significantly simplify administrative burdens in a coherent way with the rest of the U nion sustainable finance framework , and to help i nvestors efficiently understand and compare sustainability- related financial products.  (6) Within th at context, it is for the benefit of both end- investors and financial market participants to alleviate specific burdens flowing from Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 on financial market participants , and to formalise a comprehensive categorisation regime for financial products making sustainability-related claims . Th ose categories are to set up a clea r system according to which sustainability-related financial products should be clustered, in accordance with how th ose products claim to end-investors to pursue or achieve specific sustainability-related objectives or to integrate the consideration of specific sustainability-related factors. To harmonise the implementation and supervisory practices and further protect end-investors against greenwashing and misleading claims, t hose categories should rely on a clear set of criteria .  (7) It is necessary to adjust the scope of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 and to adjust certain definitions there in to reflect th o se objectives. Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 should continue to require financial market participants to disclose how they consider sustainability risks affect the financial products they offer to investors . Beyond these elemen t s , Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 should , however, focus exclusively on the specific requirements and associated disclosure s applicable to financial market participants which manufacture, manage or make available sustainability-related financial products , particularly those that reference sustainability-related elements in their names or marketing documentation to end- investors . F inancial advisers providing investment advice do not manufacture or manage sustainability-related financial products, nor do they make such products available to investors. For that reason, financial advisors providing investment advice should be carved out of the scope of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 altogether . Their role is rather as distributors to identify the products made available by financial market participants that match their clients’ sustainability preferences . The rules for distributors should therefore duly reflect the changes introduced by this Regulation , especially the categorisation regime for financial products making sustainability-related claims . The same applies to the service of portfolio management , consisting of managing portfolios of financial instruments in accordance with mandates given by clients on a discretionary client-by-client basis and which are thus not designed and marketed the same way as products identified for certain target markets.  (8) The definition in Article 2, point (17), of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 of sustainable investment has generated a considerable number of practical implementation challenges and concerns, queries to supervisors about interpretation and their expectations , and wide divergence in practical application . Practitioners also perceive duplication and coherence issues with comparable concepts laid down elsewhere in th e sustainable finance framework but which have a slightly different meaning, including those laid down in Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council 63 , and undue constraints for investments targeting the transition of undertakings or economic activities toward s sustainability in accordance with the policy outlined in the Commission Recommendation (EU) 2023/1435 in 2023 64 . At the same time, the definition of sustainable investment in Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 is used by financial market participants in the design of financial products and the communication with end-investors . The practical application of the term should thus be facilitated by deleting the definition of sustainable investment , thus overcoming the uncertainty in aligning practices with it , and instead embedding the underlying concept s in a simplified form in the concrete requirements for the associated categor y of sustainability-related financial products . That would ensure continuity, simplified application and improved certainty for financial market participants. Therefore, the concepts of contribution to an environmental and social objective , of do not significant harm, and of good governance practices should continue to be reflected in the criteria of the relevant categories.  (9) T o encourage investments contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation, the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, the transition to a circular economy, to pollution prevention and control, and the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems , e nvironmental objective s of sustainability related financial products should be defined according to Article 9 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852. S ocial objective s of sustainability related financial products should be understood as includ ing the principles of the European Pillar of Social Rights 65 and the Sustainable Development Goals .  (10) The proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directives (EU) 2022/2464 and (EU) 2024/1760 66 aims at an overall simplification and burden-reduction of sustainability disclosures and , focus their requirements on the largest companies . That same aim justifies focussing the scope of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 on sustainability-related financial products and on the financial market participants which manufacture, manage or make those products available to investors. In addition, Directive (EU) 2022/2464 already sets horizontal entity level disclosures of sustainability information covering all sectors. T herefore , the deletion of the specific requirements for financial market participants to make disclosures on their consideration of adverse impacts in their investment decisions at the level of the entity ensures no duplicat ion in disclosure requirements for entities also in scope of Directive (EU) 2022/2464.  (11) Financial market participants should not be prohibited from referring to information on sustainability aspects of an ancillary nature in the regulatory disclosures related to financial products even if not categorised as sustainability-related financial products. Such information should be fair, clear and not misleading. However, to protect investors and distinguish clearly between non-categorised and categorised financial products, such information should not constitute a prominent element in those disclosures and should not feature in the name or marketing communications of such financial products. In addition, for financial products that are categorised as sustainability-related financial products, financial market participants should ensure that the claims in the regulatory , marketing documentations and names of their sustainability- related financial products are consistent with the category under which they fall and their strategies.  (12) Building on the feedback received during the targeted and open public consultations, the technical workshops and roundtables, the Commission expert group’ reports and the call for evidence, as well as evidence of investor preferences in diverse consumer studies, there is a need to set up EU categories for products making sustainability-related claims . Such categories are called for to address the current misuse of the Article 8 and 9 disclosures and to harmonise at EU level the implementation and supervisory practices for products making sustainability-related claims. Such categories should rely on clear criteria to combat greenwashing, facilitate end-investors understanding of products’ sustainability-related strategies and objectives, and allow for an efficient distribution system based on investors’ sustainability preferences. Feedback favours the creation of three categories which should be distinguished in terms of their claims. The sustainable category should cover products claiming to invest in companies, assets, activities or projects that are already sustainable or pursue a particular objective related to sustainability factors, including environmental or social objective s. The transition category should cover products claiming to invest in companies, assets, activities or projects that are on a credible path to sustainability or that pursue particular environmental or social transition-related objectives. The ESG basics category should cover products claiming to integrate other sustainability considerations beyond sustainability risks in their investment strategy. This approach would also be consistent with recent regulatory guidance by the European Securities and Markets Authority 67 . These c laims by financial products are consistent with the notion of ‘environmental claims’ under Directive 2005/29/EC 68 (Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, as amended by Directive (EU) 2024/825 as regards empowering consumers for the green transition 69 ). Consistent with Article 3(4) of Directive 2005/29/EC, requirements under that Directive are met by proper application of the requirements of this Regulation.  (13) Such categories should help distributors identify the products that match their clients’ sustainability preferences and perform their target market assessment and should therefore be reflected in the rules applicable under Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/565 70 , C ommission Delegated Directive (EU) 2017/593 71 , and Commission Delegated Regulations (EU) 2017/2358 72 and (EU) 2017/2359 73 . This would provide end-investors with a clear understanding of the main features and ambitions of sustainability-related products.  (14) To help comparability and boost integrity, a minimum portion of 70% of investments by financial products in each category should be made in accordance with the sustainability-related claim, i.e. the objective that is pursued or the sustainability-related considerations that are applied . Financial market participants should be allowed to freely allocate t he remaining investments based on diversification, hedging or liquidity needs. The se remaining investments should not contradict the sustainability-related claims of the financial product. The full implementation of an investment strategy for a given financial product can take a certain period of time, especially for alternative or private assets. That period of time is communicated in pre-contractual documents. The percentage of investments necessary to meet the objectives of the product may not be immediately reached during that phase-in period. The percentage should be attained at the latest at the expiry of the phase-in period. The 70% threshold would mean an increase in ambition compared to the 50% minimum portion of ‘sustainable investment’ required for funds using a sustainability-related term in their names under the ESMA guidelines on funds ’ names. It is also considered to allow for continuity with the rule of having 80% of investments made in accord ance with the ESG claim pursued with the fund name under th o se guidelines , considering that the conditions for the 70% threshold would be stricter than the current 80% under the ESMA guidelines ( i. e. new conditions for investments to be deemed as contributing to a sustainability or transition related objectives or as integrating sustainability-related considerations ) . Finally , it allows for sufficient margin for hedging investments, and is aligned with other international investment labels, which would facilitate international convergence. To guide financial market participants and provide them with certainty, specific investment approaches for financial products should be identified per category, but without excluding other possible approaches in each case under the condition that these provide for the same level of sustainability-related ambition. Findings from recent evaluations show that there is no ‘one size fits all’ on how to granularly specify what a positive contribution to a sustainability objective or transition should be. Th at is mainly due to the wide variety of assets, strategies, sustainability objectives or factors that exist in the current market. A closed list of granular criteria for contribution would therefore res trict the investment universe too much and risk hinder ing innovati ve practices . Instead, the list of possible approaches should aim at identifying robust existing sustainability standards and encouraging their use . T he 70% threshold should focus on ensuring harmonised levels of contribution rather than granularly specify the nature of the contribution for each category. Specific disclosures on the chosen approach to contribution should be given to end-investors. Financial m arket participants should measure their contribution , the compliance with the strategy and the progress toward s the sustainability objective, through appropriate sustainability-related indicators and disclose th ose indicators . A list of voluntary indicators should be developed for this purpose. Such indicators should build on the indicators referred to in Annex I of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288 and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2772 , and on information disclosed by companies , ensuring , to the extent appropriate, continuity with current market practices under this Regulation. T his would encourage harmonisation and comparability in the way financial market participants measure and disclose their contribution to an objective .  (15) The criteria for these categories should also simplify the way financial products today using the sustainable investment definition are required to manage principal adverse impacts on environmental or social objective s . The current approach mandates financial market participants to consider the principal adverse impact indicators on sustainability factors , currently set out in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288 74 . Stakeholders ’ f eedback highlights that this approach has not led to a robust or comparable mechanism to ensure no harm. Therefore, the current approach should be replaced by mandating financial market participants to apply a common set of clear exclusions covering practices and sectors which are commonly agreed to be most harmful and to identify and disclose the principal adverse impacts of their investments on sustainability factors. These should include, where relevant, adverse impacts on climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation, the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, the transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and control, and the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems . Financial market participants should also disclose any actions taken to address the identified principal adverse impacts. In the specific context of this framework, t his would ensure a comparable and clear approach to ensure no harm. Such approach has been considered successful and effective under the implementation of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/1818. Such exclusions should also ensure , to the extent possible, continuity with the existing regulatory framework, including with the exclusions laid down in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/1818 and in the ESMA guidelines on funds names and also rely on data available from investee companies or data that can be reasonably estimated by financial market participants . Such exclusions should reflect politically agreed environment al and social goals.  (16) The transition category should consist of financial products that aim to support the transition of undertakings, economic activities and other assets towards sustainability, or contribute to such tr ansition . This category aims at providing such products with disclosures and criteria which accurately reflect transition strategies and address t he current implementation challenges arising from the lack of recognition of transition financ e in the definition of sustainable investment in Article 2, point (17), of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 . Such challenges include difficulties for financial market participants wanting to pursue and disclose transition -related stra tegies as well as confusion and lack of appropriate disclosures for end-investors interested in investing in products with transitional objective. This category should therefore bolster the visibility, transparency and integrity of financial products which invest in the transition of undertakings, economic activities, or other assets towards better environmental or social performance, or that contribute to the environmental or social transition. Th is category should therefore capture financial products with a high level of transition ambition, selecting notably investments based on proven standards and tools, including centred on strategies tracking or replicating EU Climate Transition benchmarks (CTB) or EU Paris-aligned benchmarks (PAB) in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 of the European Parliament and of the Council 75 , on investing in transitional economic activities or in undertakings investing their capital expenditures in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2020/852 , or o n investing in undertakings or economic activities that commit to future improvements through credible transition plans or science-based targets . This category should also capture financial products with a transition-related performance set at the level of the portfolio, such as reducing portfolio financed emission over time , under the condition that the underlying investments are coherent with the transition-related objective of the products . To ensure a meaningful contribution to the international and European climate goals, financial products which pursue a climate change mitigation objective should align their ambition with th at in the Paris Agreement and in Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 , in particular for financial market participants relying on transition plans and science-based targets from companies or projects , or when pursuing a sustainability-related engagement strategy with investee companies . This category should also exclude activities which are commonly agreed to be harmful to the environment and society, while giving investors the possibility to invest in companies at different starting points in their transition efforts. These exclusions should ensure sufficient alignment with the ones defined under the EU Climate Benchmarks and introduced by the ESMA guidelines on funds names for all funds using certain ESG terms in their names, including ‘transition’ -related terms . They should cover activities related to prohibited weapons as defined in the upcoming amendment to Regulation (EU) 2020/1818 76 , the cultivation and production of tobacco, violations of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) principles or the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises (OECD MNEs), and hard coal and lignite. This category should also exclude companies developing new projects linked to oil or gaseous fuels, and companies developing new projects, or without a plan to phase-out from, hard coal or lignite for power generation. Moreover, like products falling under the sustainable category , products falling under the transition category should identify and disclose the principal adverse impacts of their investments on sustainability factors, and explain any actions taken to address those impacts.  (17) The ESG basics category should consist of financial products the strategy or design of which is based on selected sustainability factors . Feedback received during the targeted and open public consultations, the technical workshops and roundtables, the Commission expert group’ reports and the call for evidence, as well as evidence of investor preferences in diverse consumer studies, highlights the need to cater for such financial products to allow for innovative sustainability approaches and for end-investor preferences which include products avoiding harmful investments. The criteria should cater for investments which do not specifically pursue a sustainability or transition related objective but integra te sustainability factors in their investment strategies through credible sustainability-related approaches. The criteria should list several approaches which could be adopted by financial market participants, such as outperformance of the investment universe of reference benchmarks measured by an ESG rating or a sustainability indicator, a combination of sustainable or transition standards , as well as investments that favour undertakings or economic activities with a proven positive track record on certain sustainability factors. This category should also exclude activities which are commonly agreed to be harmful to the environment and society in alignment with the ones defined under the EU Climate Benchmarks and introduced by the ESMA guidelines on funds names for all funds using ESG terms , but ‘sustainab ility -related terms or ‘impact’ - related ones . They should cover activities related to prohibited weapons as defined in the upcoming amendment to Regulation (EU) 2020/1818 , the cultivation and production of tobacco, violations of the UNGC principles or OECD MNEs , and hard coal and lignite.  (18) The sustainable category should consist of financial products that invest in companies , assets or activities that are sustainable or that pursu e or positive ly contribut e to environmental and / or social objectives . This category should capture financial products with a high level of ambition in th at regard, selecting notably investments based on proven standards and tools , including centred on strategies replicating or managed in reference to an EU Paris-aligned benchmarks in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 of the European Parliament and of the Council 77 , on invest ing in sustainable economic activities in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2020/852, on in vesting in instruments issued in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2023/2631 of the European Parliament and of the Council 78 , and on investments in relation to operations benefiting from a Union budgetary guarantee or financial instruments under Union progr ammes pursuing environmental or social objectives. Accordingly , the exclusions for f inancial products in th is category should extend beyond those for the other two categories and encompass activities where the value chain is associated with fossil fuels , including the expansion of fossil fuels . In particular, t he exclusions should include the ones of the transition and ESG basics category, in addition to activities linked to oil fuels, gaseous fuels , electricity generation with a GHG intensity of more than 100 g CO2 e/kWh . This category should also exclude companies developing new projects linked to oil or gaseous fuels, and companies developing new projects, or without a plan to phase-out from, hard coal or lignite for power generation. Moreover, beyond these exclusions, products falling under the sustainable category should identify and disclose the principal adverse impacts of their investments on sustainability factors, and explain any actions taken to address those impacts. This requirement would complement the common binary exclusions and ensure that any other principal adverse impacts on sustainability factors are identified, disclosed, and potentially addressed. It would bring accurate transparency on adverse impacts, therefore allowing end-investors to understand the potential harm of such products, while bringing more legal clarity on the required obligation to financial market participants than the current principle of ‘consideration’ of principal adverse impact indicators . I ndicators should be developed that build on the current principal adverse impact indicators referred to in Annex I to Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1888 and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2772 for voluntary use by financial market participants when complying with the identification and disclosure of principal adverse impacts. However, financial market participants should have the flexibility to disclose these principal adverse impacts using a different approach, such as different indicators or a qualitative explanation of such impacts and actions, if it fits better the nature of the impact identified or addressed. This flexibility on how to identify the impacts should allow them to focus on the impacts which are actually relevant for their products depending on the assets, strategies and objectives pursued. This requirement would align to a certain degree with existing criteria in other international frameworks while ensuring that the EU rules remain more ambitious including through the implementation of common binary exclusions.  (19) To encourage the use of well-established EU standards, the sustainable and transition category should provide for appropriate treatment and legal cert ainty for products relying on the EU Taxonomy and the EU Climate Benchmarks. Products replicating or managed in reference to an EU Paris-aligned benchmark should be considered as products qualifying under the sustainable and transition category . Similarly, products replicating or managed in reference to an EU Climate Transition benchmark should be considered as products qualifying under the transition category. In addition, products with a proportion of T axonomy-aligned investment equal or higher than 15% should be considered product s complying with the contribution criteria of the sustainable and transition category. The latter would still need to apply the exclusions mandated under the category they wish to comply with on the portion of the portfolio that is not aligned with the EU Taxonomy. Based on the opinion of the Platform for Sustainable Finance, the 15% threshold provides for sufficient incentive for products to aim for an ambition portion of investment in Taxonomy-aligned economic activities while being aligned with the current state of the market. More specifically, this threshold should be attainable by about half of the current investment funds disclosing under Article 9 of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 . The threshold should be subject to review 36 months after the date of application to continue to align it with the state of the broader economy and reflect any development under the EU Taxonomy in order to ensure it provides the right incentive. These provisions aim at simplifying the implementation of the categories, enhancing the coherence of the EU sustainable finance framework, and encouraging the use of these EU labels and standards by providing certainty to their users.  (20) Within the categories of products with sustainab ility and transition -related objectives, r ecognition should be given to the practice of impact investing . Acknowledging the specific characteristics of impact investing, including the objective of intentionality and target ing measurable change in s pecific pre-defined environmental or social areas with an upfront theory of change and with reporting on the outcomes , helps to promote the contribution which impact investing can make to addressing various environmental and social need s. Specific disclosures should therefore apply to financial product s that are categorised as sustainability-related financial products with sustainability or transition-related objectives and that pursue specific impact s as understood for these type s of investment practices . T he use of the term ‘impact’ in the names of financial products should be restricted accordingly .  (21) Pre-contractual and periodic disclosures for financial products that are categorised as sustainability-related product should contain all relevant information about the objective, strategy, and investment approaches to comply with the 70% requirement, chosen indicators for measuring performance, compliance with applicable exclusions, and relevant data sources used to inform the design, compliance and measurement of the criteria applicable to the financial product. Financial products falling under the sustainable and transition category that pursu e an environmental objective should disclose whether and the extent to which they use the EU Taxonomy as one of their investment approaches, to meet the 70% requirement. This disclosure requirement on the use of the EU Taxonomy will enhance comparability across financial products with environmental objectives. In addition, disclosures on any ESG ratings included in market documentations of sustainability-related products should be included in websites disclosures , as per requirements under Regulation (EU) 2024/3005. These disclosures should allow end-investors to understand the specific characteristics of each sustainability-related financial products, compare them and understand whether they fit their sustainability preferences , and facilitate the provision of financial and insurance advice .  (22) There are currently no comprehensive metrics for gauging the sustainability of general - purpose sovereign, sub-sovereign and supranational debt issuances . I nvestments in such debt issuances should therefore be excluded from counting toward s the contribution of financial products to sustainability or transition related objective s . W ithout affecting the treatment or inclusion of those debt issuances among investments by financial products in general, investments in such debt issuances should be excluded from qualifying for the numerator of the portion of investment that needs to be reached by financial products that are categorised under the sustainable and transition categories. However, financial market participants should be allowed to includ e th ose debt issuance s in the numerator of financial products that are categorised under the ESG basics category , using available methodologies that are appropriate to assess the sustainability of those investments for th at purpose. Further, the exclusions regarding investments which financial products that are categorised as sustainability-related financial products cannot make , apply to companies, and not to sovereigns, sub-sovereigns and supra - nationals. Those exclusions therefore do not restrict investments in debt issuances by sovereigns, sub-sovereigns and supra - nationals, which can thus feature in the denominator of those financial products, including notably debt issuances by Union Member States, Union-level bodies and other public sector bodies not subject to any applicable Union-level financial sanctions. In contrast, investments in financial instruments issued by sovereigns, sub-sovereigns and supra - nationals , where the use of proceeds is known , where th o se instruments support specific sustainability aims , and provided that those financial instruments do not directly or indirectly fund activities that are excluded from investments by financial products that are categorised as sustainability-related financial products , can be included in the numerator of all categorised financial products. This balanced approach should allow sustainability-related financial products to continue to fund public projects and activities related to sustainability, while providing safeguards to potential greenwashing risks. Financial market participants should ensure that investments in public sector debt by categorised financial products are consistent with the stated sustainability-related objective or strategy o f those products to avoid greenwashing risks and be aligned with end-investors ’ expectations .  (23) T he creation of categories for sustainability-related financial products requires provisions that determine how products that are exposed to categorised products should assess their eligibility to a category and if they do not qualify for a category , how such non-categorised financial products which invest in categorised financial products should disclose information about those investments . In order to assess the eligibility to a category, financial market participants should be able to rely on the information disclosed regarding categorised financial products and combine it with the information on their other investment s . In cases where a financial market participant uses the services of an entity regulated to provide portfolio management services, the financial market participant should be able to rely on the information provided by this entity which can be mandated to invest in accordance wit h the criteria for categorised products by its client . In case where investments of those products in categorised products reach the 70% threshold for their portfolio, and where compliance with other criteria, notably exclusion criteria, is also ensured, these products could be considered to qualify as categorised products themselves. This assessment should build on information on the underlying categorised products (e.g.  either the minimum investment required for categorised products under this Regulation, or the actual investment if available) and information disclosed by portfolio managers. Provided the appropriate exclusions are met in each case, only products that meet the 70% threshold by investing solely in sustainable products could be considered sustainable, while those investing across categories would fall either within the transition (if mixing sustainable or transition products) or ESG basics (if mixing products from any of the three). For financial products that do not qualify for a category but invest in categorised financial products, in order t o ensure comparability, disclosure s should include how much th ese financial products have invest ed in financial products that are categorised as sustainability-related financial products , as well as in portfolios managed for clients on a discreti onary basis in accordance with the criteria for categorised products , and how much in non-categorised products . For this purpose , financial market participants should be able to rely on the information disclosed regarding categorised financial products as well as the information disclosed by the authorised entity in change or providing the service of portfolio management . Th at should help financial market participants managing, manufacturing or making available such products inform their clients on the sustainability-related elements of these products in a more harmonised way , while allowing them to rely on the information provided for the underlying categorised products and without requiring them to separately verify th is information. Those non-categorised products should however not be able to use sustainability-related terms in their names , that are reserved for categorised products, but should be able to include sustainability-related claims in the ir marketing communications , provided they are clear, fair and not misleading, and accurately reflect the information they disclose on the relative shares of investments in categorised products and in other assets.  (24) T he wide range of potential investable assets for financial products that can be categorised as sustainability-related financial products means that t here will continue to be certain data gaps in relation to sustainability data from investees and other assets . It is th erefore appropriate to formalise and improve transparency about the use of estimates by financial market participants , without however imposing new requirements on third party sustainability data providers. Notably, proportionate steps should be introduced whereby financial market participants are to document their use of data sources and their use of external and in-house estimates and are to provide their clients with information on such use upon request.  (25) T o help promote the functioning of the single market for sustainability-related financial products, as part of deeper and more integrated financial markets to mobilise savings and investments across the Union in support of competitiveness, environmental and social objectives , Member States and national competent authorities should not set or apply additional requirements as regards the consideration and disclosures of sustainability risks , or as regards the criteria, procedures, and disclosures concerning the categorisation of sustainability-related financial products .  (26) Where existing financial products are closed to new investors and would no longer be offered to investors after the date of application of this Regulation , for reasons of proportionality f inancial market participants should be able opt out of applying this Regulation to those financial products .  (27) T he power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission to allow for the specification of the conditions for investments to contribute to given transition-related or sustainability-related objectives or to integrate sustainability factors for the categorisation of financial products as sustainability-related products , and disclosure templates for such financial products. It is of particular importance that the Commission carr ies out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including with the European Supervisory Authorities established by Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council 79 , Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council 80 , and Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council 81 , and with the Member States Expert Group on sustainable finance , where appropriate. The European Supervisory Authorities should also support the Commission in conducting appropriate testing of consumers and investors to inform how product distributors best identify the products that match clients’ sustainability preferences under Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/565 , C ommission Delegated Directive (EU) 2017/593 , Commission Delegated Regulations (EU) 2017/2358 and (EU) 2017/2359 , based on the categorisation, and ensure that associated investor- facing details are easily understandable in all official languages of the Union . T hose consultations should be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making 82 . In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council should receive all documents at the same time as Member States’ experts, and their experts should systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.  (28) In order to ensure unform conditions for the implementation of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 as amended by this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council 83  (29) The amendments to Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 should be reflected in Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council 84 . Notably, the k ey i nformation document accompanying products categorised under Regulation (EU) 2019/2088, as amended, should contain information on the category , a description of its objective , and relevant indicators.  (30) This Regulation adapts i nformation requirements related to the degree to which financial products invest in sustainability-related activities, including activities that contribute to an environmental objective as set out in Article 9 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852, in light of the revised scope and subject matter. Given that the definition of the term ‘sustainable investment’ should be deleted and given the changes introduced by this Regulation to the disclosure requirements, the detailed disclosure requirements laid down in Articles 5 to 7 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 become moot.  (31) To monitor the implementation of this Regulation and to monitor and possibly cater for market evolution and innovation, the European Supervisory Authorities should take stock of the market for sustainability-related financial products and deliver a report to the Commission on best practices every two years. This would allow for both encouraging best practices and monitor the need for any adjustment for the underlying criteria of the sustainability categories.  (32) Financial market participants shall start applying this Regulation 12 months after the date of application of this Regulation for IBIP s , pension products, pension schemes and PEPP s . These products are not subject to the ESMA guidelines on funds names and therefore will require more time to implement the new underlying criteria, especially to implement the exclusions.

Title of the proposal/initiative  Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 on sustainability-related disclosures in the financial services sector  1.2. Policy area(s) concerned  Savings and Investments Union, European Green Deal, Sustainable Finance Strategy  1.3. Objective(s)  1.3.1. General objective(s)  The first general objective is to protect the integrity of the EU single market for sustainable finance by ensuring requirements which mitigate risks of greenwashing, and to better help investors seize opportunities in sustainability-linked financial products. The second general objective is to boost the competitiveness of Europe’s financial sector by ensuring conditions which make business easier and help to deepen the single market for sustainability-linked financial products and thus to efficiently allocate capital for Europe’s sustainable prosperity. Overall, this is set to ensure a better use of the potential of the European single market for sustainable finance to contribute to funding the transition towards Europe’s sustainable prosperity and competitiveness.  1.3.2. Specific objective(s)  Specific objectives  The first specific objective is to simplify and reduce the sustainability-related administrative requirements of the SFDR for financial market participants, as well as to enhance the coherence of the framework for their operational needs. The second specific objective is to improve end-investors’ ability to understand and compare sustainability-linked financial products. The specific objectives tackle the main problems which have been identified both for financial market participants on the one hand, and for investors on the other, which inhibit their ability to, respectively, design financial products and deploy corresponding investments in an efficient and effective manner toward the EU’s sustainability, competitiveness and other strategic policy goals.  1.3.3. Expected result(s) and impact  Specify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.  Financial market participants and investors with an interest in sustainable investing are expected to benefit from a simple categorisation for all products with environmental, social and governance (ESG) objectives and features, with a common set of rules regarding ESG claims in names, marketing communication and in the distribution of such products. The categories would effectively cluster ESG financial products into three groupings depending on their objectives and levels of ambition. End-investors would be better able to grasp whether a financial product is focused on contributing to a sustainability objective/made largely of sustainable assets, focused on helping companies to transition toward more sustainable practices, or integrating broader or lighter ESG strategies. The underlying criteria of the categories would ensure harmonised minimum ESG performance, notably against risks deemed unacceptable by the majority of sustainability-minded investors, thereby increasing investors’ protection against greenwashing risks. The regulation would be clearer and simpler to apply than today, with lower costs and risks of national gold plating. The initial one-off costs would be offset by overall burden reductions expected to reduce recurring costs over the medium to longer term. Overall, the impacts are expected to boost the integrity and scale of the EU single market for sustainable finance and encourage the efficient allocation of capital in line with the objectives of the savings and investments union.  1.3.4. Indicators of performance  Specify the indicators for monitoring progress and achievements.  To monitor progress towards meeting the specific and general objectives , the Commission would work together with established processes underway notably with the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) and the Platform for Sustainable Finance (PSF) to analyse:  The costs incurred by the industry – Supervisory authorities could survey and assess the implementation costs linked to the new categorisation system at the latest 3 years after its implementation. This assessment could also monitor the cost reductions from the reduced disclosures.  Possible occurrences of greenwashing in EU markets. – Building on existing processes, supervisory authorities could regularly continue to monitor occurrences of greenwashing, continue to oversee sustainability-related claims by products, and periodically survey investors to help assess the effectiveness of the revised SFDR as a tool against greenwashing and ensuring decision-relevant data for investors.  Capital flows to sustainable investment – Building on the work of the Platform for Sustainable Finance to monitor capital flows to sustainable investment, a targeted analysis a few years after the implementation of the regime could be carried out to assess the degree to which the categorisation system, together with the simplified disclosures, has helped boost financing toward sustainable economic activities and projects and helped lower the cost of capital linked to these.  1.4. The proposal/initiative relates to:   a new action   a new action following a pilot project / preparatory action 85   the extension of an existing action   a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action  1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative  1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative  Once agreed by co-legislators, an implementation and preparatory period would precede the entry into application of the revised SFDR framework. The transition to the new rules would be facilitated by the fact that the proposals build on existing market practices and regulatory guidance to a large degree, and allow for a further phasing-in period for financial products which are not subject to this guidance.  1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, greater effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this section 'added value of EU involvement' is the value resulting from EU action, that is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.  The need for a coherent common framework for sustainability-related disclosures for financial products across the EU was established as part of the original SFDR. The objectives remain fully valid, and enjoy broad stakeholder support. Without Union-level action to review the current regime, the challenges identified with it would persist in the shape of undue complexity and a lack of clarity regarding the sustainability-linked features of available financial products, negatively impacting their credibility and uptake.  To overcome these problems and boost the effectiveness and efficiency of the single market for sustainable finance products, the necessary simplification and adjustment of the existing SFDR framework can only be done in a coherent and effective way at EU level. Actions by Member States could, in contrast, only address some of the identified issues, but with the risk of fragmentation of the single market (diverging levels of transparency between national markets, growing disparities in investor confidence in ESG products across Member States, risks of more barriers and challenges for cross-border market participants, and further limits to the comparability of products across the single market).  Action at EU level to ensure uniform simplifications and a common set-up for the ESG-features of financial products, together with solutions to ESG data-related challenges, is more conducive to a harmonised, effective, efficient and coherent outcome across the single market, and in support of the broader strategic objectives of the Union. In short, EU level action would boost the proper functioning of the single market for sustainable finance and in addition contribute to improving transparency for investors across the Union to enable their participation in EU capital markets in general, in line with the objectives of the Savings and Investments Union.  1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past  The lessons learned from some of the challenges with the existing rules can be summarised as the need to (i) ensure a coherent implementation timeline for the updated changes, (ii) introduce clearer, simpler and more proportionate rules and concepts for the benefit of financial market participants and investors, (iii) formalise and embedding these in a framework of product categories, to help cluster available products in this way, and (iv) ensure that the revised concepts, rules and possible categories rely on ESG data that is available and/or possible to reliably estimate.  1.5.4. Compatibility with the multiannual financial framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments  The review serves the objective of helping to mobilise funds toward the competitive opportunities in the green transition and other evolving strategic priorities in line with Union objectives. As such, it can ease the pressure off public funds, which are increasingly stretched in terms of competing and new emerging priorities, to finance and catalyse funds towards sustainability objectives. Specific co-investments into relevant EU financial programmes are also encouraged under the criteria for the product categories.  1.5.5.

In contrast to the wider scope in terms of products, and greater number of datapoints (and services) covered at present, the future rules would hinge on fewer datapoints for products which integrate or embrace ESG features in their design. In order to collect the relevant data, financial market participants’ reliance on digital data collection, processing and vending platforms and their own deployment of in-house digital data management tools would be streamlined. For investors and their own deployment of digital search and comparison tools, disclosures would be more focused on the most meaningful datapoints, facilitating accessibility (and comparability) of key data. Both for financial market participants (preparers of product-data) and investors (users of product-data), the use of artificial intelligence tools, in accordance with the requirements and risk parameters of the AI Act, would be facilitated. To streamline data collection and processing, the changes are commensurate with those introduced under the ‘Omnibus I’ simplifications for sustainability data from corporates. In addition, the digital tagging of SFDR data at entity-level introduced under Article 18a of the Regulation for the purposes of the creation of a European single access point (ESAP) to help the publication of machine-readable information for investors is adjusted accordingly.  Alignment with the once-only principle  The data required for defined specific purposes for categorised sustainability-related financial products under the revised SFDR will be largely reusable between them (i.e. pre-contractual and periodic disclosures for financial market participants’ websites). The data required will principally hinge on ensuring: (a) measurable indicators to demonstrate that a sufficient portion of financial products’ investments are aligned with their stated sustainability objectives or attributes and (b) compliance with a set of mostly binary exclusions regarding sectors and activities which the products cannot invest in. The data choices for the first would largely depend on financial market participants’ design of their products, and those for the second would largely constitute a straightforward explanation to demonstrate that they do not invest in excluded activities. The revised rules also formalise and set out transparency requirements for the use of estimates for the purposes of, mostly, the first requirement, as well as reliance on external data providers. The simplified data flows facilitate it to be findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable, and to meet high-quality standards.

Initially introduced in 2021, the SFDR aims to improve how financial products incorporate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors, helping investors make informed decisions and combat misleading sustainability claims, often termed ""greenwashing."" Despite its success in increasing ESG-characteristic financial products, the regulation has faced criticism for its complexity and the challenges financial institutions encounter in accessing reliable ESG data.

To address these issues, the Commission's proposal seeks to simplify the SFDR, reduce administrative burdens, and improve enforcement. The goal is to maintain the integrity of the EU's single market for sustainable finance by focusing on requirements that prevent greenwashing and enhance investors' ability to compare sustainability-linked financial products. This effort aligns with the European Green Deal's objectives and aims to simplify EU regulations to enhance competitiveness and efficiency. The proposal also aims to boost the competitiveness of Europe’s financial sector by making business conditions easier and deepening the single market for sustainability-linked financial products, thereby helping to allocate capital for Europe’s sustainable prosperity.

The proposal includes simplifying and reducing sustainability-related administrative and disclosure requirements for financial market participants and advisers, while enhancing the framework's coherence for operational needs. It seeks to improve end-investors' understanding and comparison of sustainability-linked financial products. The proposal integrates considerations for human rights and aims to cater to investments that integrate sustainability factors into their strategies"

CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  Union legislation should deliver its policy objectives efficiently, effectively and transparently. These longstanding principles can be traced back to the 2001 White paper on Governance ( 1 ) which put better regulation and stakeholder engagement at the heart of European policymaking. The Competitiveness Compass ( 2 ) continues the promotion of responsible law-making . It announced unprecedented efforts to simplify legislation to reignite the competitiveness of European business. Moreover, the Commission has since strengthened targets to reduce administrative costs for business (together with public authorities) and Small and Medium sized Entreprises by 25% and 35% respectively ( 3 ).  A mature body of Union environmental law now exists. The Commission takes seriously its duty to manage these laws effectively and invests heavily in reviewing ( 4 ) their application to ensure that they deliver as intended and that problematic issues are tackled early. Moreover, the Commission is committed to ‘stress-test’ all EU laws under its current term of office. The content of this proposal (and others in the ‘omnibus’ package) represents the initial fruits of the Commission’s ongoing ‘stress-testing’ in the environment area ( 5 ) built on extensive dialogue and inputs from civil society. The omnibus package addresses legislation related to the circular economy, the operation of industrial installations, the management of geospatial data, and environmental permitting.  The above legislation are crucial parts of delivering the Union’s commitment to a fair green, and digital transition and the shift towards a circular economy in particular. It is important that this legislation works well, mobilises the Union’s assets like the single market and avoids imposing unnecessary costs on business, public authorities and citizens.  This specific proposed Directive aims to reduce the administrative burden for producers established in one Member State of the Union selling their products in other Member States, in relation to the participation of these producers in the extended producer responsibility schemes in those other Member States, set up under Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 on batteries and waste batteries (the Batteries Regulation)( 6 ) and under Regulation (EU) 2025/40 on packaging and packaging waste (the Packaging Regulation) ( 7 ) .  The producer of a product placed on the market of a Member State has the responsibility to cover the costs of managing the product at its end of life (so called ‘Extended Producer Responsibility or EPR). The Waste Framework Directive sets out the minimum general requirements for extended producer responsibility while specific rules for different product groups exist in other legislation such as the Regulation on packaging and packaging waste, the Regulation on batteries and waste batteries, the Directive on electronic and electrical waste, and the Single Use Plastics Directive , as well the Directive on end-of-life vehicles (currently subject to revision under an ongoing ordinary legislative procedure) ( 8 ). Member States may also establish national rules on extended producer responsibility for other products, provided these rules comply with the minimum requirements set out in Article 8 and 8a of the Waste Framework Directive.  An authorised representative for EPR acts on behalf of an economic operator (producer) selling products in a Member State where the producer is not established or if it is established in a third country. The purpose is to ensure that producers making available products on the territory of a Member State comply with the rules on EPR so that the costs of the management of waste generated in that Member State are covered.  In the May 2025 Communication on a strategy for the single market( 9 ), the Commission highlighted the complexity of EPR rules as a major barrier in the internal market, in particular as regards the possibility or obligation for a producer to have an authorised representative for EPR in each Member State where the producer makes its products available .  This proposal would provide additional flexibility by allowing producers established in the Union and selling products in another Member State to choose whether they appoint an authorised representative for EPR. Provisions regarding the appointment of authorised representatives for EPR for producers based in third countries should remain as they currently are contained in sectoral legislation.  This proposal suspends certain provisions of two Regulations in the area of environment, waste management. Further possible modifications of those Regulations or further suspensions of their provisions are entirely outside of the scope and aims of the present proposal. The need for such modifications may be assessed, as appropriate, in the context of further stress-testing of EU environmental legislation announced in the [Chapeau Communication] and in Commission work programme 2026. The Commission will constructively engage with the co-legislators, in order to ensure that the legislative process on the present proposal fully preserves its essential object and does not distort it.  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  The current proposal promotes a similar approach across circular economy/waste legislation regarding the operation of schemes for extended producer responsibility. This will facilitate the functioning of the internal market while aiding business operations.  • Consistency with other Union policies  This proposal is part of a package of measures aimed primarily at cutting red tape for economic operators. It is entirely consistent with the Commission’s policies on better regulation, and the objectives of the Competitiveness compass to promote greater competitiveness and economic resilience in the Union. The rationalisation introduced by these measures will not affect the achievement of the objectives in the concerned policy area nor the rationale of the legislative acts.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  The legal base of the proposal is 192(1) TFEU in relation to batteries and 114 TFEU in relation to packaging. This reflects the underlying legal base of the Regulations containing provisions on authorised representatives for extended producer responsibility that the proposal suspends.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  The Batteries Regulation was adopted in recognition of the expected demand for batteries in the coming years, the strategic role of batteries in the global transition towards decarbonised economies and the need to establish a functioning internal market and to avoid market distortions. As such the Batteries Regulation sets out common rules on the sustainability, performance, safety, collection, recycling and second life of batteries as well as on information about batteries for end-users and economic operators. For these reasons, the suspension of provisions of the Regulation is similarly justified on subsidiarity grounds.  Products need appropriate packaging to be protected and easy to transport from where they are produced to where they are used or consumed. Prevention of barriers on the internal market for packaging is key to promote the efficient functioning of the internal market for products. Fragmented rules and vague requirements cause uncertainty and additional cost to economic operators. For these reasons, the suspension of provisions of the Regulation is similarly justified on subsidiarity grounds.  • Proportionality  In the case of the circular economy legislation, the proposal would introduce alternative means to deliver the policy objectives of ensuring that waste products, batteries or packaging are appropriately managed at the end of their useful life. These respond to the concerns of producers operating across Member States.  • Choice of the instrument  A proposal for Regulation is the appropriate choice of instrument given that the underlying legislation that the proposal suspends are Regulations.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  Revisions of the Batteries Regulation and the Packaging Regulation were recently adopted by the Legislator based on Commission’s proposals that were supported by impact assessments. An evaluation cannot be carried out at this stage as too little time has passed, and too little practical experience was gained for a standard evaluation to be useful at this point in time.  • Stakeholder consultations  The staff working document accompanying this proposal provides more information on the various consultation activities that have been undertaken to support the preparation of this proposal. The key consultation activities are summarised below.  The following consultation activities have been carried out to prepare this omnibus proposal:  – A call for evidence 10 for the environmental omnibus open for feedback from 22 July 2025 to 10 September 2025.  – A high-level roundtable on simplifying environmental laws on 2 October 2025.  The call for evidence on environmental simplification drew a lot of attention . The Commission published a call for evidence on the environmental simplification package on the Have-Your-Say website: Simplification of administrative burdens in environmental legislation . The feedback period was from 22 July 2025 till 10 September 2025. All feedback is published on the Have-Your-Say website.  There were 190 998 contributions to the call for evidence, of which 189 751 (99.3%) came from citizens. 1 247 (0.7%) contributions came from organisations other than citizens, including businesses and business associations, non-governmental organisations (environmental and other), public authorities and academics. 622 attachments, mainly position papers, were attached to these submissions, which often included specific suggestions.  From a business perspective, there is support for less burdensome regulation that leaves business with flexibility to deliver both growth and sustainable production. There is a perception of administrative obligations that are too prescriptive, and do not provide value added.  On the side of civil society, there is support for a simplification that makes it easier to protect the environment and social standards and avoid deregulation, for example by removing redundancies and avoiding excessively detailed regulations. There is however concern that efforts to simplify regulations could undermine environmental protections. Citizens urged the EU to focus on enforcing existing laws rather than creating new simplifications.  The Commission is currently preparing an impact assessment to support the preparation of the Circular Economy Act in 2026. This assessment will utilise ongoing consultation activities that will also cover simplification of existing (waste and circular economy-related) legislation, and particularly EPR related legislation.  • Collection and use of expertise  The Commission contracted an external service provider to provide expertise related to this proposal. In particular, the contractor has screened the known body of environmental laws to identify reporting and other administrative obligations together with potential to simplify these obligations. In addition, the contractor has provided assistance in quantifying the reductions in costs of possible measures to simplify provisions in the omnibus package. All information provided by the contractor will be published.  • Impact assessment  An impact assessment has not been prepared primarily because the proposal is highly specific with little choice available to remedy the underlying issues. A staff working document does however accompany this proposal. It justifies the content of the proposal and presents quantitative information about the expected impacts. It also presents the views and inputs of stakeholders which the Commission has received.  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  Under the regulatory fitness and performance programme (REFIT), the Commission ensures that its legislation is fit for purpose, targeted to the needs of stakeholders, and minimises burdens while achieving its objectives. This proposal is therefore part of, and fully coherent with, the REFIT programme in so far as it attempts to simplify administrative procedures related to the appointment of authorised representatives for extended producer responsibility and reduce unnecessary costs for producers.  • Fundamental rights  The proposal has no adverse impact on fundamental rights as enshrined in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights as it solely impacts the appointment of an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  Not applicable.  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  Given the very specific nature of the proposal, there is no need for implementation plans to guide the application of the new provisions. Existing monitoring and reporting provisions in the affected Regulation will continue.  • Explanatory documents (for directives)  Not applicable.  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  Article 1 suspends the application of Article 56(3) of Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 until January 2035.  Article 2 suspends the application of Article 45(3) of Regulation (EU)2025/40 until January 2035.  2025/0395 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  suspending the application of the rules on the appointment of an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility for batteries and waste batteries and packaging and packaging waste  (Text with EEA relevance)  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 192(1) and 114 thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 11 ,  Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions 12 ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) The political guidelines for the Commission’s 2024-2029 term 13 point to the goal of simplifying, consolidating and codifying legislation to eliminate any overlaps and contradictions while maintaining high standards and staying the course on the goals set out in the European Green Deal .  (2) In its Communication entitled ‘A simpler and faster Europe: Communication on implementation and simplification’, 14 the European Commission set out a vision for an implementation and simplification agenda that delivers fast and visible improvements for people and business on the ground. That requires more than an incremental approach and the Union is to take bold action to achieve that goal. The European Parliament, the Council, the Commission, the Member States’ authorities at all levels and stakeholders need to work together to streamline and simplify Union , national and regional rules and implement policies more effectively.  (3) In its Communication on a Strategy for the Single Market 15 , the Commission identified as a barrier to the internal market that b usinesses face inconsistent national regulations which make it harder to sell, scale or move goods and services across borders. The Commission committed to focus on the ten most harmful barriers as a priority. The Communication identified c ertain features of extended producer responsibility schemes as one of the barriers most frequently reported by companies operating cross-border in the Union . While extended producer responsibility schemes are derived from Union legislation, a lack of uniformity of principles and requirements has led to a large diversity of extended producer responsibility schemes set up in Member States as well as to regulatory complexity and high administrative burden for companies. Th is Regulation is a first stepping stone to more profound simplification of the extended producer responsibility schemes in the area of waste, while the upcoming Circular Economy act should provide for further simplification.  (4) In particular, d ue to that lack of harmonisation, in particular regarding the current provisions in sectoral legislation for the appointment of an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility , the fulfilment of the obligations related to the appointment may result in an unnecessary administrative burden on producers operating in multiple Member States where they are not established. Particularly for small and m edium -sized enterprises , the obligation to appoint authorised representatives separately in every Member State where the producer places products on the market poses a significant challenge in terms of costs. With a view to ensuring equal conditions for producers established in the Union , it is important that producers are subject to the same rules in all Member States for appointing an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility. The currently fragmented legal framework for different products and the administrative burden associated with fulfilling the requirement to appoint an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility in up to 26 Member States is hampering the competitiveness of producers established in the Union . It is thus crucial to harmonise the existing rules effectively and promptly, reducing the associated burdens on such producers. To this effect, the Commission is currently reviewing the effectiveness, the administrative burden and the unintended barriers for the internal market , of the obligation to appoint authorised representatives as a safeguard for the producers’ compliance with the ‘polluter pays‘ principle. This review is likely to lead to alternative solutions which are more effective and less burdensome.  (5) With a view to simplifying requirements on producers , and reducing the administrative burden, battery producers and producers of packaging or packaged products (‘packaging producers’) should be able to choose whether they appoint an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility when making available products on the market of another Member State where they are not established , but the appointment should not be mandatory. This allows those producers who have already appointed an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility to retain their existing arrangements , while immediately alleviating the costs and administrative burden for producers who wish to not appoint an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility.  (6) Ensuring traceability and enforcement with regard to battery producers and packaging producers established in third countries is more challenging compared to those operating within the Union, as such producers fall outside the territorial scope of Member States’ enforcement powers and are not covered by the Union administrative and judicial cooperation mechanisms that enable the enforcement of obligations and judgments within the internal market. The existing provisions on the appointment of an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility for producers established in third countries should therefore be maintained in their current form. Thus, the provision in Regulation (EU) 2025/40 of the European Parliament and of the Council 16 which sets out that Member States may provide that producers established in third countries are to appoint an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility when making packaging or packaged products available on their territory for the first time should remain applicable. However, Member States should be allowed to ensure traceability and enforcement with regard to packaging producers established in third countries through alternative means. Similarly, the provision in Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 of the European Parliament and of the Council 17 which sets out that battery producers that are established in the Union or in third countries and that are making available batteries within the territory of a Member State by means of distance contracts are to appoint an authorised representative should remain applicable to the extent that it covers producers established in third countries. However, Member States should be required to ensure traceability and enforcement with regard to battery producers established in third countries through alternative means.  (7) The provision in Regulation (EU ) 2023/1542 that makes the appointment of an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility for producers established in the Union and selling batteries by means of distance contracts directly to end-users in another Member State mandatory should be suspended until 1 January 2035.  (8) The provision in Regulation (EU) 2025/40 that makes the appointment of an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility for producers established in the Union and making packaging or packaged products available for the first time on the territory of another Member State, directly to end users, mandatory should be suspended until 1 January 2035.  (9) The Commission is preparing a legislative proposal for a comprehensive reform of the extended producer responsibility system. The proposal is expected to be tabled by the Commission, in accordance with its Work Programme, in 2026. The legislative proposal will be subject to the ordinary legislative procedure and, if adopted by the European Parliament and by the Council, the Member States and the producers will have to take the necessary measures to align their regulatory and organisational measures with regard to the extended producer responsibility , as well as their conduct to the new rules.  (10) Suspending the application of the requirement for battery producers and packaging producers established in one of the Member States to appoint authori s ed representatives for extended prod ucer responsibility when making batteries or packaging or packaged products available in another Member State serves as a preliminary measure to immediately alleviate burdens for producers, paving the way for the implementation of a comprehensive reform of the extended producer responsibility system .  (11) Since the objectives of this Regulation , namely to provide flexibility to producers established in the Union as to whether they appoint an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives,  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  Article 1  Suspension of Article 56(3) of Regulation (EU) 2023/1542  The application of Article 56(3) of Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 shall be suspended until 1 January 2035.  As regards battery producers established in third countries, where Member States do not require the appointment of an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility, they shall ensure traceability and enforcement with regard to battery producers established in third countries through alternative means.  Article 2  Suspension of Article 45(3) of Regulation (EU) 2025/40  The application of Article 45(3) of Regulation (EU) 2025/40 shall be suspended until 1 January 2035.  Member States may either provide that producers established in third countries shall appoint, by written mandate, an authorised representative for the extended producer responsibility when making packaging or packaged products available on their territory for the first time or ensure traceability and enforcement with regard to packaging producers established in third countries through alternative means.  Article 3  Entry into force  This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union .  This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.

FRAMEWORK OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE  1.1. Title of the proposal/initiative  Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council suspending the application of the rules on the appointment of an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility for batteries and waste batteries and packaging and packaging waste  1.2. Policy area(s) concerned  Environment  European Green Deal  1.3. Objective(s)  1.3.1. General objective(s)  The general objective pursued by this legislative proposal is to simplify elements of Regulations (EU) 2023/1542 and (EU) 2025/40 with regard to the appointment of an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility.  1.3.2. Specific objective(s)  By suspending the application of the provisions in Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 and (EU) 2025/40 that mandate the appointment of an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility for producers established in the Union, packaging and battery producers will be able to choose whether they appoint an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility when making available products on the market of another Member State where they are not established, but the appointment will not be mandatory. This allows those producers who have already appointed an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility to retain their existing arrangements, while immediately alleviating the costs and administrative burden for producers who wish to not appoint an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility. 1.3.3. Expected result(s) and impact  Specify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted. The proposed suspension of the application of the mandatory appointment of an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility for producers established in the Union will alleviate administrative burden and costs from the producers of packaging and batteries. Especially SMEs will benefit from not having to appoint an authorised representative.  1.3.4. Indicators of performance  Specify the indicators for monitoring progress and achievements.  To monitor progress towards achieving the proposal’s specific objectives, the Commission will explore the possibility of organising exchanges with Member States in different formats, including by using the existing fora.  1.4. The proposal/initiative relates to:   a new action   a new action following a pilot project / preparatory action 18   the extension of an existing action   a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action  1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative  1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative  The suspension should apply until 1 January 2035.  1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, greater effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this section 'added value of EU involvement' is the value resulting from EU action, that is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.  The proposal will create a harmonised approach across sectoral legislation. To ensure uniform conditions for producers within the Union, it is essential that the same provisions are applied across Member States for appointing an authorised representative for extended producer responsibility. The existing fragmented legal framework for various products and the administrative challenges linked with appointing an authorised representative in up to 26 Member States are hindering the competitiveness of Union-based producers. It is necessary to efficiently and swiftly harmonise the current rules, thereby alleviating the burdens faced by these producers.  1.5.3.

CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL  • Reasons for and objectives of the proposal  This proposal aims to contribute to the timely and efficient development and interoperability of resilient energy infrastructure across the EU. Energy network infrastructure plays a crucial role in reinvigorating EU competitiveness, ensuring the security of our Union and in the energy transition and decarbonisation. At the same time, the development of energy networks is confronted with new and significant challenges,  Electricity grids will need to serve growing demand linked to electrification of end-uses and the ramp-up of the hydrogen system. Electrification of final energy consumption in the Union is aimed to increase from around 23% currently to around 32% in 2030 , as set out in the Clean Industrial Deal . 1 Member States should aim for an electricity interconnectivity level of 15% by 2030 . 2 Networks will need to integrate 2.2-2.4 TW of renewables capacity to meet 2040 EU targets . 3 Grids will need to adapt for the EU to have a more decentralised, digitalised and flexible electricity system with millions of rooftop solar panels and local energy communities sharing resources. By 2040, electricity transmission and distribution grids will require investments of EUR 1.2 trillion and hydrogen networks of EUR 240 billion . 4 Offshore renewables alone should increase by up to 360 GW by 2050 5 , which need to be connected to shore including through necessary onshore grid reinforcements. Hydrogen will be important in decarbonising industrial and transport processes where electrification is not an attainable solution . Hydrogen networks will connect production and demand centres across Europe, where on-site hydrogen production is not feasible.  The Draghi report 6 called for simplifying and streamlining permitting and administrative processes as well as for a coordinated strategic approach to cross-border infrastructure development between the EU and Member States. The Council invite d the Commission to propose a strengthened framework for grid planning and rollout to be compliant with EU targets . 7 In its Conclusions of 16 June 2025 8 , the Council call ed on the Commission to propose a grid s package consisting of measures to, inter alia , simplify EU rules on grids, integrate EU-level, regional and national needs, ensure the delivery of projects, develop effective cost sharing mechanisms for cross-border projects of common interest, and assess the need for further legislative proposals to accelerate permitting of energy infrastructure. The European Council in its Conclusions also called for Union-wide long-term investment planning to fully integrate and interconnect the EU electricity market, contributing to the Union’s energy security, and infrastructure protection and resilience . 9 The European Parliament highlighted the importance of modernising and expanding grids , as well as investment into digitalisation, with a focus on integrated cross-sector and cross-level planning . 10 It also emphasises cross-border infrastructure as a condition for successful deepening of the single market and for increasing the Union’s resilience. 11  The TEN-E Regulation, adopted in 2013, has contributed to the Union’s core energy policy objectives by laying down rules for identifying and ensuring the timely development of Projects of Common Interest (PCIs), that will ensure interoperability of trans-European energy networks, the functioning of the internal energy market, security of supply in the Union and the integration of renewable forms of energy. It has also contributed to streamlined permit granting procedures for Projects of Common Interest (PCIs) and provided for regulatory assistance, rules and guidance for the cross-border allocation of costs and risk-related incentives and the conditions to access financing from the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). The TEN-E Regulation was revised in 2022 to bring the framework in line with the 2050 climate neutrality objective under the European Green Deal.  While the objectives of the TEN-E Regulation remain largely valid, several short-comings need to be addressed to ensure the framework is fit to support a decarbonised, competitive and resilient energy system towards 2050, in line with the Clean Industrial Deal objectives and the European Climate Law.  First, e xisting and planned infrastructure projects are not sufficiently targeted towards achieving the EU’s energy and climate objectives . There is a substantial gap between our cross-border electricity infrastructure needs and the speed and level of infrastructure development at both the transmission and distribution grid level. 12 For electricity, about half of cross-border electricity needs for 2030 (41 of 88 GW) will remain unaddressed, and this gap is expected to increase the next decade. By 2040, cross-border electricity capacity needs will amount to 108 GW. 13 Failing to address infrastructure needs could hinder system decarbonisation, undermine security of supply and potentially lead to further market fragmentation and higher energy prices. From system efficiency perspective, current framework does not consider use of alternatives to grid expansion, such as non-wire or digital solutions. Further, improved hydrogen network planning and integration will be crucial to ensure system optimisation and decarbonisation of industry.  Second, the implementation of cross-border infrastructure projects is too slow , increasing overall project costs and impeding network development. The completion of electricity infrastructure projects takes up to 10 years for transmission grids. Delays are often attributed to difficulties in reaching agreement on cost-sharing when projects carry benefits outside their hosting Member States. As cross-border infrastructure becomes more integrated, the number of such projects with benefits occurring outs  ide the hosting Member States is expected to increase. In addition, delayed permitting procedures continue to constitute a key bottleneck, accounting for more than half of the time needed to complete an electricity transmission infrastructure project.  Finally, concerns over infrastructure security . Recent physical and cyber security incidents have highlighted the risk of hostile actors targeting the Union’s energy infrastructure, with economic cost implications and consequences for the stability of our energy system. There is also a rising interest from third-country actors to invest in EU energy infrastructure, which can increase the Union’s exposure to risks related to energy security. Beyond deliberate acts of sabotage, emerging risks including natural hazards and climate-related impacts also affect the resilience of the EU’s energy infrastructure.  This proposal to revise the TEN-E Regulation aims to address these issues, which were identified in the Impact Assessment and Implementation Report accompanying this proposal. Specifically, the proposal will introduce changes to:  · Ensur e that projects included in the network development plans and selected as PCIs/PMIs address appropriately and effectively identified infrastructure needs with due consideration of non-wire solutions .  · Facilitat e the use of cost-sharing tools for faster deployment of cross-border infrastructure projects, leading to an increased use of cost-sharing tools and a reduction in project deployment times.  · Simplify and accelerate permit gran ting procedures for cross-border energy infrastructure projects (PCIs/PMIs) making it feasible to meet existing deadlines.  · Enhanc e physical and cyber security and resilience of cross-border energy infrastructure.  Further, the initiative assessed and identified a set of measures to simplify and improve the efficiency of the TEN-E Regulation and reduce compliance and regulatory costs for stakeholders where possible (see below).  • Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area  This proposal responds to the Commission’s commitment in the Action Plan for Affordable Energy 14 to propose a European Grid Package consisting of legislative and non-legislative measure s to, amongst others, simplify the TEN-E Regulation , ensure cross-border integrated planning and delivery of projects, especially on interconnectors ; streamline permitting for grid s , enhance electricity distribution grid planning; accelerate the ramp-up of the hydrogen market; boost digitalisation and innovation. The proposal builds on the revision of the TEN-E Regulation in 2022 , as well as the 2023 EU Action Plan for Grids 15 that focused on implementing the TEN-E Regulation framework.  The Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) is complementary to the TEN-E Regulation by addressing the financing gap for PCIs with a high socioeconomic and societal value , but which lack commercial viability. The eligibility for financial assistance under CEF is linked to the scope of the infrastructure categories covered under the revised TEN-E Regulation considering that hav ing obtained PCI or PMI status is a precondition for financing from CEF for cross-border infrastructure projects. The proposal is consistent with the current CEF under the 2021-2027 Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), as well as the proposal for the CEF under the 2028-20 34 MFF , which highlights “ the vital importance of a genuine Energy Union and well-integrated EU infrastructure networks ” by substantially increasing the budget proposed for the CEF-E 16 .  The proposal is also consistent with the targets and objectives set out in the Electricity Market Directive and Regulation, the Governance Regulation and the Renewable Energy Directive, notably enabling the integration of the Union’s energy markets and the large-scale deployment and integration of renewable energy sources and flexibility solutions.  • Consistency with other Union policies  This proposal is complementary to other initiatives that aim to create a more integrated European energy market. It is also consistent with the proposed 2040 EU climate target and 2050 climate neutrality obligation enshrined in the European Climate Law. This proposal is adopted together with an amending Directive aiming to accelerate the permitting of energy infrastructure projects, including transmission and distribution grids, storage and recharging station and renewable energy projects in order to facilitate their fast deployment.  The revision of the TEN-E Regulation aims to support the goals of the electricity market legislation by ensuring that infrastructure brings additional socio-economic welfare and to further strengthen efficient use of existing infrastructure. Possible measures to enhance electricity interconnection targets enshrined in the Governance Regulation will be assessed as part of the revision of that Regulation and measures to further support the necessary national investment levels in energy infrastructure.  The security-related measures under this proposal build on the requirements of the horizontal security legislation, including the EU Critical Entities Resilience Directive 17 , the NIS 2 Directive 18 and the Network Code on sector-specific rules for cybersecurity aspects of cross-border electricity flows 19 . Measures suggested under this proposal support its objectives and implementation , as well as the framework for the screening of foreign direct investments into the Union , while being specifically focused on infrastructure in scope of the TEN-E . T he 2026 revision of the EU Energy Security Framework will address energy security horizontally, complementing the network specific approach under this proposal .  The Industrial Accelerator Act will include measures to accelerate permitting of projects to decarbonise energy-intensive industries. Having sufficient grid capacity and timely grid connection is crucial to electrify industry, hence both initi atives are developed in close cooperation . 20 The proposal is also relevant for the Trans-Mediterranean Renewable Energy and Clean Tech (T-MED) Initiative and the Pact for the Mediterranean.  In view of the planned Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) Package, th is proposal will not address carbon dioxide cross-border infrastructure planning. Given a strong link between network planning on a national, regional and local levels and the heating and cooling sector, the recent revision of the Gas Directive 21 requires stronger coordination among sectors. The Grids Package aims to build upon these requirements . In addition, the upcoming Electrification Action Plan and the Strategic Roadmap on Digitalisation and AI in the energy sector as well as the Heating and Cooling Strategy will provide important input for future grid planning. The Package also underpin s the upcoming Cloud and AI Development Act to attract investment in data centres.  2. LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY  • Legal basis  The proposal is based on Article 172 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union ( TFEU), which provides for the legal basis to adopt guidelines covering the objectives, priorities and broad lines of measures envisaged in the sphere of trans-European networks as set out in Article 171. The guidelines are to identify PCIs that are necessary for making the TEN-E fit for purpose and set the conditions under which the EU may financially support the PCIs.  • Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)  The proposed amendments fulfil the principle of subsidiarity , as action at Union level will contribute to the further integration of the Union energy market through the modernisation and development of Europe’s cross-border energy network more effectively than action at national level.  The need for EU action  Energy transmission infrastructure (including an interconnected offshore grid and smart grid infrastructure) has a European added value due to its cross-border impacts and is essential to achieve a climate neutral energy system. The TEN-E Regulation has contributed to achieving results regarding the Union energy market integration, competition and security of supply. A framework for regional cooperation across Member States is necessary to develop cross-border energy infrastructure. The internal energy market requires cross-border infrastructure, the development of which requires cooperation of two or more Member States, all with their own regulatory framework.  National regulation and planning are not sufficient as individual national administrations do not have the power to deal with cross-border infrastructure planning. Internal network elements significantly influence the possibilities of cross-border infrastructure development, which in turn affects cross-border trade. More closely coordinating national and European planning is necessary due to the character of the EU’s meshed network and to build a more efficient energy system.  EU added value  The TEN-E Regulation has provided added value compared to what could have been achieved at national or regional level alone. More than 100 projects were completed thanks to the PCI status between 2013-2025. The accelerated electrification, decarbonisation and digitalisation of industry and deployment of renewable energy projects call for the reinforcement of energy infrastructure at an unprecedented pace, that cannot be met by national measures alone. More effective cross-border planning will improve the integration of clean energy sources as well as meeting electricity market needs, which would help the EU reach its energy and climate targets. A more integrated market encourages the development and uptake of innovative technologies for transmission and distribution of energy and contributes to system flexibility and security of supply. This can result in a more efficient network and improve cross-border trade for a more cost-efficient and secure energy system.  • Proportionality  The initiative complies with the proportionality principle. It falls within the scope for action in the field of the trans-European energy networks, as defined in Article 170 of the TFEU. The policy intervention is proportional to the scale and nature of the problems identified in the Impact Assessment and the achievement of the set objectives of the initiative. The proposed revision of the TEN-E Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the general objective of ensuring the timely and efficient development and interoperability of resilient energy infrastructure, renewable energy and flexibility, including storage and recharging stations, across the EU.  The proposed measures contribute to more effectively addressing the Union’s energy infrastructure needs, ensure faster project deployment, and enhance the resilience of the EU’s energy network infrastructure, without imposing significant costs for Transmission System Operators and project promoters, Member States, National Regulatory Authorities and the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER).  Based on the results of the Implementation Report, the Commission assessed several policy options covering four impact areas of the current TEN-E framework, namely infrastructure planning and project implementation, cost and benefit sharing, permitting and security. The comparison of the options (see section 6 and 7 of the Impact Assessment Report) indicates that Policy Option 2 is best suited to achieve the specific objective of the initiative without imposing disproportionate additional burden on relevant actors. The proposal is based on Policy Option 2 which appears proportional to the nature of the problem by focussing on streamlining the current processes and offering new substantive new tools that are considered effective to meet the objectives of this initiative.  • Choice of the instrument  Building on the overall positive experience with the implementation of the current TEN-E Regulation and the positive evaluation of the previous Regulation, the instrument chosen is a Regulation, an effective instrument which has direct application and is binding in its entirety, ensuring uniform implementation and legal certainty.  3. RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS  • Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation  Given the scope of th e proposed revision and the recent amendment of TEN-E Regulation in 2022, it was not feasible to conduct an ex-post evaluation. Instead, an Implementation Report was prepared and included as part of the Impact Assessment Report . The Implementation Report focuses on the performance of the specific provisions introduced and revised as part of the 2022 TEN-E Regulation revision. It replaces a full evaluation which would only be expected as part of the review of the TEN-E Regulation due in 2027 . 22 An evaluation was previously conducted between January 2019 and September 2020, in context of the 2022 TEN-E Regulation revision. 23  The Implementation Report provided evidence of the need for further improvements, namely when it comes to scenario development, infrastructure needs identification and consequent Ten Year Network Development Plan (TYNDP), PCI/PMI project selection and assessment, as well as cross-border cost allocation (CBCA) and permitting frameworks. The report found that the scenario development and infrastructure gaps identification processes are faced with drawbacks, including delays which hamper their effectiveness in meeting the TEN-E Regulation goals. The Commission and ACER have little means to steer the process towards identification of the key projects for the Union. Moreover, while the permitting-related amendments of the 2022 revision of TEN-E Regulation generally achieved their intended objective to increase the clarity and flexibility of procedures, further improvements could be made to support the acceleration of procedures, contributing to the process’s overall efficiency. Regarding cross-border cost allocation, the TEN-E Regulation provisions have facilitated the allocation of investment costs for PCI/PMIs, primarily to support CEF applications. However, there have been very few instances of involvement of non-hosting countries in CBCA decisions, and none in the electricity sector. Provisions have therefore had limited effectiveness in triggering additional investments from non-hosting countries that may otherwise significantly benefit from the projects.  This proposal aims to tackle these issues identified in the Implementation Report annexed to the Impact Assessment Report, through targeted amendments to the TEN-E Regulation.  • Stakeholder consultations  In line with the Better Regulation guidelines, the Commission carried out a comprehensive online public consultation between 13 May to 5 August 2025 on the ‘Have Your Say’ website. The consultation covered the following topics: i) the general functioning of the TEN-E Regulation, ii) EU infrastructure planning, iii) electricity network planning at national level, iv) electricity grid hosting capacity, v) permitting, vi) investments in grid infrastructure, vii) supply chains, viii) digitalisation and resilience, and ix) simplification.  The consultation received a total of 197 responses. In addition, 2 emails were received via a functional mailbox for the consultation. There were 197 responses to every multiple-choice question in the public consultation, meaning that every respondent answered each question. For some questions, respondents were asked on a five-point scale the extent to which they agreed or disagreed with statements. The scale was i) Strongly disagree ii) Slightly disagree, iii) Neutral, iv) Slightly agree, v) Strongly agree. A “don’t know” option was also given.  Stakeholders’ views were split on whether the TYNDP and national transmission development plans ensure integrated and coherent planning across EU and national levels. Opinions on the extent to which the TYNDP identifies all cross-border infrastructure needs were also diverse. Still, a majority (54%) indicated that the current governance framework of the TYNDPs, including stakeholder roles, should be revised to enhance its effectiveness. Moreover, in line with the legislative proposal, about half (44%) believed the TYNDP falls short in addressing identified infrastructure gaps and a majority (60%) agreed that national projects should more clearly support EU-wide priorities. Further, a majority of respondents (61%) also agreed that there is a need for stronger alignment between national transmission development plans. In addition, a majority of respondents (59%) were positive to streamlining the PCI/PMI application process by amending requirements for projects with PCI/PMI status to reapply during each process (provided certain conditions are met) in line with this proposal.  When asked whether the TYNDP should have a more top-down approach to infrastructure planning aimed at aligning network development with EU and Member State climate and energy goals, 41% of respondents (many of which system operators) disagreed whereas 36% agreed. Similarly, 41% of respondents (many of which system operators) expressed disagreement with the TYNDP having a more top-down European approach to better link identified needs and priority projects of common European interest, whereas 36% agreed. While this legislative proposal strengthens EU-level steer in the infrastructure planning process with the Commission taking over central scenario development and being empowered to launch calls for proposal to address infrastructure gaps, the proposal maintains strong Member State involvement and validation of steps in the process striking a balance to also align with the public consultation results. On the frequency of the processes, most stakeholders (85%) found the current two-year cycle appropriate. The legislative proposal prolongs the current two-year TYNDP cycle to four years, but maintains flexibility if updates are needed.  A majority of respondents were positive to the inclusion of internal reinforcements (72%) and non-wire solutions (54%) in infrastructure needs identification, aligning well with the legislative proposal. A majority (62%) of stakeholders also agreed that more EU-level action is needed to enhance the visibility and quantified benefits of digital, innovative, and grid-enhancing technologies. A larger majority, 76% argued that further measures are needed to increase the efficiency of the existing grid.  A s regards the cost-sharing , 38% 24 of respondents stated that the current framework is not fit for purpose and 36% 25 favoured that the CBCA framework further develops to facilitate the sharing of investment costs among countries, beyond hosting Member States, in proportion to the expected benefits , indicating support for legislative revision . Further, 37% 26 of respondents thought that an investment request within the CBCA framework could also cover several projects (‘bundling’ ) to facilitate cost sharing amongst more Member State beneficiaries in line with th is proposal .  Permitting was ranked by most respondents as a key barrier to developing grid infrastructure at the necessary pace for the energy transition, indicating support for the strengthening of the TEN-E framework in this respect. Further, about a third of respondents reported that the permitting provisions of the TEN-E Regulation are not clear or easy to implement, with 16% remaining neutral and 34% unsure. A vast majority of stakeholders support simplifying and streamlining of environmental assessments, digitalising permit-granting procedures, shortening of legal deadlines for permitting of networks in line with the legislative proposal.  As regards security-related measures, over a third of stakeholders agreed that the EU legal framework does not sufficiently address emerging security risks ( 38%) 27 and that additional security criteria for PCIs and PMIs are needed to enhance protection against physical and cyber risks (36%) 28 in line with the legislative proposal. Furthermore, only 14% indicated that the framework addresses the exclusion of non-trusted actors from participating in critical infrastructure projects, with 19% revealing neutrality and almost a majority, 45% (companies 41%, business associations 48%, NGOs 86%, public authorities 40%) being uncertain.  The feedback received from stakeholders as part of the consultation was taken into account in developing the proposal. The measures under this legislative proposal therefore align well with the stakeholder views.  For a detailed analysis of the public consultation results, please see Annex 2 of the Impact Assessment Report accompanying this initiative.  • Collection and use of expertise  The proposal and its underpinning impact assessment draws on evidence from the Implementation Report on the TEN-E Regulation, from stakeholder input to the extensive consultations carried out in this respect, as well as a literature review, PCI portfolio analysis and modelling.  Formal conclusions adopted in the framework of the Copenhagen Forum in 2023, 2024 and 2025 were also considered in the analysis. The Copenhagen Forum gathers annually representatives of the EU institutions, transmission system operators, project promoters, regulators, energy companies, NGOs and civil society and the financing community to discuss the challenges of developing Europe’s energy infrastructure.  ACER’s annual consolidated monitoring reports on the progress of electricity and gas PCIs, incremental capacity projects and virtual interconnection points, on the electricity and gas market monitoring and capacity allocation and congestion management, as well as other updates on the cross-border cost allocation decisions, project-specific risk-based incentives were equally considered.  The proposal and its underpinning impact assessment draws on evidence from the Implementation Report on the TEN-E Regulation, from stakeholder input and extensive consultations carried out in this respect, as well as a literature review, PCI portfolio analysis and modelling. Further information was gathered through several support studies to support the development of policy options and assessment on investment needs in infrastructure, infrastructure planning and costs of delays.  • Impact assessment  In accordance with the Better Regulation guidelines, the Commission carried out an impact assessment of several policy options. This work was supported by structured consultation within the Commission via an Inter-Service Steering Group. The impact assessment was presented to and discussed with the Regulatory Scrutiny Board (RSB). The RSB gave a positive opinion with reservations on 26 September 2025 which were notably addressed by: i) further clarifying the problem drivers and root causes and their links to the proposed measures, ii) elaborating the assessment of subsidiarity considerations, iii) revising the general and specific objectives, specifying what success will look like, making the operational objectives more S.M.A.R.T, and elaborating on monitoring arrangements, iv) more clearly presenting and justifying how the different options compare in terms of costs and benefits, v) further describing the content of permitting measures and their impacts, vi) highlighting possible trade-offs with other EU objectives (see Annex 1 of the Impact Assessment Report).  The impact assessment identified three key problems and their corresponding problem drivers. Throughout the impact assessment work, a range of measures were considered across four intervention areas – i) infrastructure planning and project implementation, ii) cost and benefit sharing, iii) permitting, and iv) security – to address the identified problems and achieve the general and specific objectives of the initiative. The measures under each intervention area were grouped into three policy options, following a logic of varying degrees of EU-level intervention and coordination, and taking into account internal compatibility and coherence of the measures (see Section 5.2.2 of the Impact Assessment Report).  Policy option 1 entails an enhanced bottom-up approach , introducing only a limited number of changes to the current EU legislative and policy framework in comparison to the business as usual and involves minimal additional EU-level intervention. As regards infrastructure planning and project implementation , it strengthens the existing framework by better defining certain requirements and simplifying processes (including PCI/PMI selection and Commission and ACER approvals) to ensure a leaner and more robust planning process. It also aligns the scope of PCI/PMI project categories, including by strengthening requirements related to electrolysers and removing the smart gas grid category. As regards cost and benefit sharing , it enhances transparency and strengthens EU principles as well as better enables the use of congestion income for financing cross-border electricity infrastructure as an incentive to cost-sharing. On permitting, it supports implementation of existing legislation, including by issuing guidance on the implementation of certain aspects of the environmental assessment framework. On security , it introduces physical and cyber-risk resilience considerations in the monitoring of PCIs and PMIs.  Policy option 2 entails moving from a bottom-up approach towards a more top-down approach with stronger steer from the EU-level and enhanced coordination with the current actors at Member State level. It introduces more significant changes to the current EU legislative and policy framework as compared to policy option 1, with additional EU-level coordination and reallocation of certain responsibilities among relevant stakeholders. As regards infrastructure planning and project implementation , it notably enhances the role of the Commission by entrusting it with central scenario development for the infrastructure needs identification as well as introduces a gap filling mechanism to ensure all infrastructure needs are addressed by project proposals. It also broadens the scope of the electricity PCI category to more prominently include non-wire solutions and better acknowledge the role of internal lines. As regards cost-benefit sharing , it introduces an enabling framework for the voluntary bundling of cross-border projects to enable and encourage discussions amongst relevant Member States and third countries. On permitting , it entails targeted legislative changes to accelerate permitting processes for cross-border infrastructure covered under the TEN-E Regulation. On security, it introduces additional transparency requirements regarding the ultimate beneficial owners of candidate PCIs/PMIs and including security and resilience-related equipment for the upgrade of existing electricity cross-border infrastructure under TEN-E scope.  Policy option 3 entails a full top-down approach for cross-border infrastructure. It includes substantial structural and institutional changes to the status quo and a higher degree of centralising and streamlining at EU level, including through entrusting infrastructure planning and coordination of permitting for cross-border infrastructure projects to EU bodies. As regards cost-benefit sharing, it builds on the measures of policy option 2 but introduces also mandatory regional planning and cost-sharing for offshore cross-border infrastructure projects. On security , policy option 2 and 3 are identical.  The policy options were compared along their effectiveness, efficiency, coherence, and proportionality . Policy option 2 and 3 are considered more effective, efficient and coherent with the overall EU policy framework than policy option 1. Policy option 1 only performs slightly better in terms of subsidiarity and proportionality. Therefore, policy option 1 is not considered as possible preferred policy option. While policy options 2 and 3 both perform better than policy option 1 as concerns their effectiveness in meeting the specific objectives, policy option 2 seems overall more effective at this stage when it comes to ensuring that projects included in network plans and selected as PCI/PMIs address appropriately identified infrastructure needs as well as to shorten and simplify permitting procedures. As regards the efficiency, policy option 3 is considered less efficient due to the additional resources needed and high-up front costs to set up two new entities at EU level (or reinforce existing ones) responsible for infrastructure planning and coordinated permitting procedures. In terms of subsidiarity and proportionality, measures proposed in policy option 3 (i.e. EU entities responsible for infrastructure planning and permitting as well as mandatory offshore grid planning) with a high degree of EU level intervention appear disproportionate at this stage considering they do not result in a higher level of effectiveness and are expected to entail substantially higher additional costs.  Following comparison of the policy options, policy option 2 was identified as the preferred option, best suited to achieve the general and specific objectives of the initiative in a proportionate manner. Policy option 2 is expected to have positive economic, social and environmental impacts . The key target groups expected to be impacted by this initiative are European citizens and consumers, project promoters (including TSOs), European TSO associations (ENTSO for Electricity, ENTSO for Gas, and ENNOH), National Competent Authorities and their local and regional representatives, National Regulatory Authorities, European Union Regulators, Distribution system operators and DSO branch organisations, and energy producers/industry.  As regards economic impacts, it is expected to significantly reduce energy system costs in line with the optimal grid scenario by ensuring that identified projects better match and fully cover the identified needs. For 2040, investments of EUR 6 bn/year into the optimal grid would lead to EUR 14 bn/year reduction in system costs, that is EUR 8 bn/year net saving. It is also expected to have a substantial impact on wholesale electricity prices by improving interconnectivity, leading to price convergence and, overall, more stable and lower prices, across the EU. An improved cost-sharing framework should facilitate the materialisation and quicker implementation of cross-border projects, with significant socio-economic welfare gains. Further, quicker permitting times and thereby project implementation, is expected to generate economic benefits in terms of avoided costs of delays for project promoters. Finally, through improved energy infrastructure security, the preferred option could bring about benefits in terms of avoided loss of economic welfare and of costs of repairs.  Energy system cost reductions are expected to have positive implications for competitiveness, through avoided costs and mitigating network tariff increases for consumers, including industry. The preferred option also shows positive impacts on digitalisation, through stronger emphasis on the use of non-wire solutions in grid planning and digitalisation of permitting procedures. The preferred option overall expected to reduce administrative and adjustment costs for businesses (including energy generators, project promoters, TSOs and ENTSOs) through streamlining infrastructure planning, PCI/PMI application and evaluation processes as well as permitting procedures.While the annual costs savings for businesses cannot be fully estimated as relevant data were not available, it can be concluded that the preferred option would lead to recurrent cost saving. For Member States and national authorities, policy option 2 would create additional administrative costs in the short-term, related to the implementation of revised legislative framework.  The initiative is expected to have positive social impacts, though the quantitative impacts and distributional effects are difficult to estimate. An optimised grid planning based on precise estimates of future development of demand and supply should avoid future stranded assets, minimising grid costs for consumers, and enable further electrification allowing to spread grid investment costs over a higher number of kWh.  As regards environmental benefits , the preferred policy option is expected to lead to a reduction of CO2 emissions (around 27 Mtonnes/year ) by aligning with the optimal grid scenario and decreasing renewable e n ergy curtailment . The additional 108 GW cross-border capacities needed by 2040 in line with the 2024 TYNDP would also allow to substitute 65 TWh of electricity produced by gas with RES generation, by allowing a better integration of non-CO 2 emitting generation, leading to a significant reduction of European CO 2 emissions estimated at 27 million ton nes of CO 2 emissions avoided in 2040. 29 As regards permitting, environmental impacts are highly dependent on the technology used and the assets’ location and the environmental status of the surrounding fauna and flora. The potential impacts are however addressed in the design of the proposed measures through introducing safeguard s.  • Regulatory fitness and simplification  The revised TEN-E Regulation is expected to bring positive impacts in terms of simplification and improved efficiency. The initiative is expected to reduce the administrative burden on ENTSOs, TSOs and project promoters notably as regards infrastructure planning as a result of the Commission taking over central scenario development and through simplifications such as the reduced frequency to a four-year cycle and the amended application and evaluation process for mature PCIs. The streamlined, simplified and digitalised permitting procedures for PCIs and PMIs would also reduce the administrative burden for businesses. The annual cost savings for businesses cannot be fully estimated as relevant data were not available, but it can be concluded that the proposal will lead to recurrent cost savings.  No direct impacts in terms of compliance or administrative costs for SMEs or micro-enterprises are identified. SMEs could benefit from positive competitiveness impacts as a result of lower energy system costs, as well as increased competitiveness in those technology areas that are included or strengthened in the proposal (e.g. high-voltage technologies).  The initiative is consistent with the Digital Check and is internet ready and appropriate for both the physical and digital environment. The proposal includes measures to promote digitalisation (see the Legislative Financial and Digital Statement).  • Fundamental rights  The initiative is not expected to have an impact on fundamental rights.  4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS  The budgetary impact associated to the proposal concerns the resources of the European Commission Directorate-General for Energy and the Joint Research Centre, as well as the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER). The Commission will take on substantial additional responsibilities for central scenario development as part of the infrastructure needs identification process in the Ten-Year Network Development Plan. These responsibilities will require additional resources (see Legislative Financial and Digital Statement).  The ACER will be tasked with additional responsibilities in the oversight of the Ten-Year Network Development Plan, as well as the cross-border cost allocation framework. These additional responsibilities will also require additional resources (see Legislative Financial and Digital Statement).  5. OTHER ELEMENTS  • Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements  Building on the existing processes for monitoring data from regular reports prepared by project promoters and national regulators, several indicators have been developed to measure the achievement of each of the specific objective of the revised TEN-E Regulation. The actual impacts of the legislation will be monitored and evaluated against a set of indicators tailored to the specific policy objectives to be achieved with the legislation.  All data will be monitored on the basis of regular reports from project promoters and national regulators, and on the basis of the existing monitoring requirements of ACER including the biennial monitoring of consistency between the Union-wide TYNDP and national network development plans, annual monitoring of progress of PCIs and PMIs and permitting processes, annual monitoring report on congestion management and capacity allocation, monitoring of the application of non-wire and grid enhancing technologies based on data available by the Joint Allocation Office, and annual monitoring of the achievement of the interconnection target, done as part of the European Semester.  By 30 June 2033, the Commission shall carry out a review of this Regulation, on the basis of the results of the reporting and evaluation provided for in Article 24 of this Regulation, as well as the monitoring, reporting and evaluation carried out pursuant to Articles 22 and 23 of Regulation (EU) 2021/1153.  • Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal  Chapter I of the Regulation outlines the general provisions, notably its subject matter, objectives and scope as well as the definitions applicable. It introduces, complemented by Annex II, new infrastructure categories compared to Regulation (EU) 2022/869 to ensure strengthened safety, security and efficiency of existing networks, notably to enable existing high-voltage networks elements to operate systems safely through investments in monitoring control and digitalisation equipment and installations and to increase the protection and resilience of critical network elements through investment in equipment that is specifically designed for that purpose and physically connected to those elements. Project categories and definitions are also adjusted to align with the EU’s decarbonised gas and hydrogen legislative package adopted in 2024 setting common rules for the transition to renewable and low-carbon gases; this package prioritises the production and use of hydrogen in its pure form and its transportation in the dedicated hydrogen system. A definition of “non-wire” solutions in electricity is also introduced; these solutions need to be carefully considered as they may be cheaper than grid expansion to ensure cost-optimal grid planning.  Chapter II outlines the provisions as regards the process of preparing the Union lists of projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest within the regional groups, the criteria for the assessment of projects by the groups and the monitoring of project implementation.  Article 3, complemented by Annex III, provides rules for the establishment of regional groups as well as for the process for establishing the Union list of projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest. Compared with Regulation (EU) 2022/869, Article 3 and Annex III provide for a simplified approach for advanced projects already on the Union list to maintain their status of project of common interest or project of mutual interest.  Compared with Regulation (EU) 2022/869, Article 4 which sets out the criteria for the assessment of projects by the groups, complemented by Annex IV, further clarifies that projects of mutual interest extend to the first connection point in the third country and ensures that these projects are accompanied by corresponding development in internal infrastructure in third countries. For Energy Community contracting countries, the benefits brought by individual projects are considered for both EU and Energy Community contracting countries, and not only for the EU as done so far.  In Article 5 the provisions on the implementation and monitoring of projects on the Union list are strengthened by requirements related to risk assessments as regards physical and cyber security, building on Directive (EU) 2022/2557 on the resilience of critical entities and Directive (EU) 2022/2555 on measures for a high common level of cybersecurity across the Union. As regards European coordinators that may be designated where a project encounters significant implementation difficulties, Article 6 provides that the period for which the designation applies may be renewed.  Chapter III addresses the permit granting and public acceptance of projects of common interest. Compared with Regulation (EU) 2022/869  this chapter has been revised with three main objectives: (1) update the permitting framework to ensure that projects of common interest  and projects of mutual interest are granted the best treatment possible in line with their strategic importance and special status, especially when considering the permitting measures introduced in the Hydrogen and Decarbonised Gas Market Package and the revised Renewable Energy Directive; (2) update the permitting regime to support the accelerated permitting for electricity grids, in line with the needs recognised in the Draghi report and the amendments introduced in Directive (EU) 2019/944; (3) increase the clarity of the permitting regime and improve its efficiency.  Article 7 on the priority status of projects on the Union list is updated to include requirements that electricity projects of common and mutual interest benefit from an automatic presumption of overriding public interest and, when included in a National Development Plan subjected to a strategical environmental assessment and to an appropriate assessment under Directive 92/43/EEC in case there is a likely significant impact on Natura 2000 sites, may, subject to strict conditions, be exempted from assessments under specified environmental legislation.  Article 8 on the organisation of the permit granting process clarifies the responsibilities of national competent authorities established under the Regulation in line with the different permitting schemes, especially in what concerns cooperation with other authorities and mediation of contacts with project promoters. It also increases the cross-border cooperation requirements for projects involving multiple jurisdictions.  Article 9 on transparency and public participation provides for increased clarity and simplicity of the procedure, notably by merging the reporting obligations of this article into a single report.  Article 10 on duration and implementation of the permit granting process introduces in particular an obligation to digitalise permitting procedures; clarifies what is considered as the starting date for the permitting procedure; makes the optional nature of the pre-application phase clearer; elaborates on the steps comprising it (scoping, screening, scheduling, application file verification); clarifies the need to take into account existing studies and authorisations to reduce duplication when defining the documentation necessary for the permitting process; and introduces tacit approval to decisions taken by the concerned national authorities with the exception of environmental decisions.  Chapter IV outlines the provisions as regards cross-sectoral infrastructure planning, which are strengthened compared with Regulation (EU) 2022/689, with a view to better steering of the planning, notably as regards the definition of future scenarios, the identification of long-term energy infrastructure needs and bottlenecks and addressing those needs with the most adequate solutions.  Article 11 empowers the Commission to adopt delegated acts establishing a central scenario for the electricity, hydrogen and gas sectors to be used for the Union-wide TYNDP, the infrastructure needs identification process, the energy system wide cost-benefit analysis and the cross-border cost allocation of energy infrastructure projects. To ensure data used for developing the scenario are up-to date, the Commission has a right to request them from Member States, the ENTSO for Electricity, the ENTSO for Gas and the ENNOH, as relevant. The scenario should be developed in a cross-sectoral manner. TYNDP scenarios have until now been developed by the ENTSO for Electricity, the ENTSO for Gas and the ENNOH.  Article 12 entrusts the ENTSO for Electricity and the ENNOH, with developing an infrastructure needs identification report for electricity and hydrogen respectively. The report should identify infrastructure gaps affecting the Union’s objectives related to electricity and hydrogen, based in particular on a binding methodology to be prepared by ACER and the central scenario pursuant to Article 11. The Article provides that the infrastructure needs identification reports must be endorsed by the decision-making body of the TEN-E Group, which is the cross-regional meeting configuration of all Groups established under the Regulation. Specifically for electricity, the report must consider non-wire solutions when assessing and addressing the needs.  Article 13 empowers the Commission to launch a needs matching process in the electricity system to identify possible solutions for unmatched needs in case the infrastructure needs identification report for electricity concludes that projects submitted for inclusion in the Union wide ten-year network development plan do not fully meet the infrastructure needs identified pursuant to Article 12. The needs matching process should be based on existing regional cooperation, steered by the Commission and linked with the TYNDP process.  Article 14 mandates the ENTSO for Electricity and the ENNOH to use consistent single sector methodologies for a harmonised energy system-wide cost-benefit analysis at Union level when assessing projects (in all energy infrastructure categories except smart electricity grids and CO 2 ) for their inclusion in their respective Union wide ten-year network development plans. The methodologies must be submitted to the Commission for approval. ENTSO for Electricity and the ENNOH are required to calculate and publish, as part of the Union-wide ten-year network development plan, the results of cost-benefit analyses for all projects, showing how the benefits are distributed across countries. The Article further specifies that for smart electricity grids projects and CO 2 projects, it is for the Commission to develop methodologies for a harmonised energy system-wide cost-benefit analysis at Union level, as is the case today.  The provisions under Chapter V address the need to develop the grid to accommodate the significant expected scale-up of electricity generation from offshore renewable energy sources. The Chapter supports the coordinated long-term planning and development of offshore and onshore infrastructure. As a novelty, under Article 15  Member States are required, as part of their non-binding agreements and within their specific priority offshore grid corridors, to consider establishing specific cross-border goals, such as for hybrid or cross-border radial projects, with the aim to achieve the goals for offshore renewable generation to be deployed within each sea basin in the most efficient manner.  Chapter VI strengthens the provisions for a regulatory framework enabling investments with a cross-border impact.  Firstly, it specifies in Article 17 the principles that national regulatory authorities must apply when allocating costs across borders, including that in order to ensure investment certainty, the cross-border cost allocation (‘CBCA’) must be based on an ex-ante cost-allocation agreement, with the possibility of ex-post adjustments, provided that such adjustments are explicitly defined in the cost allocation decision and clearly framed, including as regards timeframes and categories of costs covered. Where appropriate, the allocation of costs amongst Member States shall be based on the distribution of net-benefits. It also includes that if 10% or more of a project’s estimated benefits occur in a Member State, that Member State and its national regulatory authority shall take part in the cross-border cost allocation process. ACER is mandated to update its Recommendation on identifying good practices for the treatment of investment requests for projects in line with the above-mentioned principles and to establish a central repository of all cross-border cost-allocation decisions taken by national regulatory authorities and to host it on its website as well as to provide a non-binding CBCA template to facilitate the work of national regulatory agencies.  Secondly, a new Article (Article 18) is introduced, which supports a process under which  project promoters may bundle two or more projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest  to facilitate the discussions on cost-sharing between the relevant Member States, and with third countries as appropriate, and the CBCA decisions between the concerned competent authorities of the Member States or between the competent authorities of the Member States and third countries, as appropriate. Article 18 further clarifies the rules on joint cost-benefit analysis and CBCA applicable to such bundles of projects in view of facilitating a possible CEF application.  Thirdly, new Article (Article 19) is introduced, requiring transmission system operators (‘TSOs’) to set aside, for network investments into projects on the Union list relevant to reducing interconnector congestion, 25% of the congestion rents not spent for guaranteeing the actual availability of allocated capacity and for compensation to offshore renewable electricity generation plant operators.  Article 19 specifies conditions for the use of the funds and empowers the Commission to adopt delegated acts to further specify the conditions under which TSOs may use these funds and the conditions for their release. ACER is required to update its existing methodology on the use of revenues from congestion income pursuant Article 19(4) Electricity Regulation to ensure consistency with these new provisions.  Lastly, Article 20 lays down the conditions under which Member States and national regulatory authorities may grant appropriate incentives for projects that incur higher risks for the development, construction, operation or maintenance, when compared to the risks normally incurred by a comparable infrastructure project.  Chapter VII sets out the conditions for the eligibility of projects on the Union list for financial assistance under the Connecting Europe Facility, including for the new infrastructure categories. In particular, compared with Regulation (EU) 2022/689, Article 21 sets out in more detail the criteria applicable for projects other than the energy infrastructure that are under the competence of national regulatory authorities. Since those projects do not receive a CBCA, they must receive an evaluation carried out by the relevant national authority and the provision develops the conditions for such an evaluation. Article 22 provides that the specific criteria set out in Article 4(3) and the parameters set out in Article 4(5) of the Regulation must be applied for the purpose of establishing award criteria for Union financial assistance under the Regulation on the Connecting Europe Facility and lays down additional requirements for legacy gas projects concerning Cyprus and Malta under Article 27 of the Regulation.  Chapter VIII includes final provisions regarding delegated acts, reporting and evaluation, including regarding the digitalisation of the permitting process, the improvement of physical and cyber security resilience of cross-border energy infrastructure and the uptake of non-wire solutions, the review of the Regulation as well as information and publicity of the projects. It further maintains the existing derogations for the gas interconnectors of Malta and Cyprus until Cyprus or Malta, respectively, is directly interconnected to the trans-European gas network or until 31 December 2029, whichever is the earlier. The Chapter further lists amendments to other energy acquis resulting from the amendments introduced in the Regulation and sets out transitional provisions and provisions for the repeal of the current TEN-E Regulation. In particular, the revised Regulation does not affect the granting, continuation or modification of financial assistance awarded previously under the Connecting Europe Facility, and the existing Union list of projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest  is to remain in force and produce effects until a new Union list of projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest pursuant to this Regulation is established and enters into force.  2025/0399 (COD)  Proposal for a  REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  on guidelines for trans-European energy infrastructure, amending Regulations (EU) 2019/942, (EU) 2019/943 and (EU) 2024/1789 and repealing Regulation (EU) 2022/869  (Text with EEA relevance)  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,  Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 172 thereof,  Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,  After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,  Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee 30 ,  Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions 31 ,  Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,  Whereas:  (1) The Commission Communication of 26 February 2025 on the “Clean Industrial Deal” 32 sets out a joint roadmap for competitiveness and decarbonisation. Securing affordable energy is a key condition for the competitiveness of the Union industry, especially for energy-intensive sectors. Access to affordable energy is therefore a cornerstone of the Clean Industrial Deal as well as the Action Plan for Affordable Energy 33 . At the same time, decarbonisation policies are a powerful driver of growth when they are well integrated with industrial, competition, economic and trade policies as set out in the Commission Communication of 29 January 2025 on a “Competitiveness Compass for the EU” 34 . With Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 of the European Parliament and of the Council 35 , the Union has set out an ambitious framework to become a decarbonised economy by 2050.  (2) As part of the ambition of Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 , the binding Union level target for renewable energy for 2030 has been increased to 42.5 % renewable energy in the U nion ’s energy mix by 2030, aiming for 45 % 36 ,  and the binding Union level target for energy efficiency has been made more ambitious, with a reduction of Union final energy consumption by 11.7 % by 2030, compared to 2020 projections 37 . With the intermediate target of at least 55 % net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction compared with 1990 levels by 2030 well on track, on 2 July 2025 the Commission proposed an amendment to Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 38 setting a Union climate target for 2040 of a 90 % reduction in net GHG emissions, compared to 1990 levels.  (3) Infrastructure needs to be in place to support the Union energy transition in accordance with those targets, including rapid electrification, scaling up renewable and fossil fuel free electricity generation, the increased use of renewable and low-carbon gases, energy integration and a higher uptake of innovative solutions. Current investments in cross-border energy infrastructure are clearly insufficient to transform and build the energy infrastructure needed to support those targets and there is a substantial gap between our cross-border electricity infrastructure needs and the speed and level of infrastructure development at both the transmission and distribution grid level . 39 For electricity, about half of cross-border electricity needs for 2030 (41 of 88 GW) will remain unaddressed, and this gap is expected to increase the next decade. By 2040, cross-border electricity capacity needs will amount to 108 GW. 40 . Increased investments in energy infrastructure are therefore necessary, and the Draghi report 41 pointed in particular to the need to rapidly increase the deployment of cross-border energy infrastructure to decarbonise Europe’s industry. In the Clean Industrial Deal 42 and the accompanying “ Action Plan for Affordable Energy ” 43 , the Commission underlined the crucial role of completing the Energy Union by investing in energy infrastructure and cross-border grids for safeguarding the competitiveness of Union industry and the prosperity of people as well as for the affordability and security of energy supply.  (4) Regulation (EU) 2022/869 of the European Parliament and of the Council 44 laid down guidelines for the timely development and interoperability of priority corridors and areas of trans-European energy infrastructure in order to contribute to ensuring climate change mitigation in particular achieving the Union’s 2030 targets for energy and climate ch ange and the climate neutrality objective by 2050 at the latest and to ensuring int er connections, ener g y security, market and system integration and competition that benefits all Member States, as well as afforda bility of energy prices. I n particular, Regulation (EU) 2022/869 provide s for the identification of projects of common interest and of projects of mutual interest , facilitates their implementation and determines the conditions for eligibility of th o se projects for Union financial assistance. However, given their cross-border nature, projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest not only create significant positive externalities and foster solidarity, but also entail specific challenges for project promoters, due to their multi-jurisdictional nature, coordination challenges and an often asymmetrical distribution of costs and benefits. They therefore continue to require a Union level framework .  (5) While the objectives of Regulation (EU) 2022/869 remain largely valid, the current trans-European energy networks framework should be adjusted to fully reflect the expected changes to the energy system that will result from the new poli cy context and in particular the 2050 climate neutrality objective and the proposed intermediary target for 2040. In particular , the re is a need for more integrated grid planning to support an increasingly interdependent and decentralised internal energy market , faster permit granting processes and to ensure the security and resilience of cross-border energy infrastructure to be adequately reflected in the revised trans-European energy networks framework. Besides the new political context and objectives, technological development has been rapid in the past decade. That development should be taken into account in the energy infrastructure categories covered by this Regulation, the selection criteria for projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest as well as the priority corridors and areas. At the same time, the provisions of this Regulation should not affect a Member State’s right to determine the conditions for exploiting its energy resources, its choice between different energy sources and the general structure of its energy supply, in accordance with Article 194 of the Treaty .  (6) The implementation of the identified 13 trans - European energy infrastructure priorit y corridors and thematic areas is essential for the achievement of the Union’s energy and climate targets including further market integration, energy security, the 2 050 climate neutrality objective as well as affordability of energy prices . Th o se priorities cover investments in electricity transmission and storage, offshore grids for renewable energy, smart electricity grids, equipment and installation designed to ensure protection and resilience of existing critical network elements, hydrogen transmission , storage and terminals , electrolysers, and the transport and storage of carbon dioxide as well as monitoring, control and digitalisation equipment and installation essential for existing high-voltage network s of cross-border relevance .  (7) The Union’s energy infrastructure should be upgraded in order to increase its resilience against natural or man-made disasters, adverse effects of climate change , deliberate hostile actions and threats to its security, in particular as regards European critical infrastructures pursuant to Directive 2022/2557 of the European Parliament and of the Council 45 .  (8) I n the current geopolitical context, it is important to ensure the uninterrupted flow of electricity across borders to ensure security of supply. T his depends not only on the resilience of interconnectors between Member States , but also on the resilience of critical network elements. Therefore, this Regulation should introduce a new infrastructure category in the form of investments into equipment and installations directly connected to and designed to enhance the critical network elements’ resilience and protection . That new infrastructure category should cover critical network elements , as set out in Regulation (EU) 2019/943 of the European Parliament and of the Council 46 , that support network security and supply security in accordance with the Member States’ crisis scenarios and risk preparedness plans under Regulation (EU) 2019/941 of the European Parliament and of the Council 47 .  (9) While foreign investment can bring benefits such as increased financing options for capital-intensive projects, it can also increase the U nion ’s exposure to energy security related risks such as disruptions or reduced reliability of cross-border flows, in particular whe re such foreign investments originate from third countries with diverging geopolitical interests from the Union . Transparency regarding ultimate beneficiary ownership , including information o n the ultimate investor and participation in the capital as set out in Regulation (EU) 2019/452 of the European Parliament and of the Council 48 , of cross-border energy infrastructure and projects with a cross-border impact is therefore crucial to prevent the Union from becoming dependent on non-trusted third countries and should be taken into consideration when selecting p rojects of c ommon interest and projects of m utual i nterest.  (10) To ensure cost-efficient and accelerated grid development and access to grid s in the Union , non-wire solutions should play a prominent role in addressing system needs next to physical grid reinforcement , as they may be deployed faster and at lower costs. D eploying such technologies should be considered before investing in the expansion of grid infrastructure . To this aim, a new infrastructure category sh ould cover investments in non-wire technologies and digital solutions, including software solutions, where they are deployed on existing critical network elements relevant for cross-border trade, and where bringing quantified benefits for market integration in terms of increasing cross-border capacity.  (11) A decarbonised gas and hydrogen legislative package was adopted with Regulation (EU) 2024/1789 of the European Parliament and of the Council 49 and Directive (EU) 2024/1788 of the European Parliament and of the Council 50 to set common rules at Union level for the transition to renewable and low-carbon gases . The infrastructure categories set out in this Regulation should be fully aligned with the objectives of that package and ensure that energy infrastructure projects have a significant cross-border impact. Where technically possible and most efficient, the possibility of repurposing existing infrastructure and equipment should be taken into account in the development of such projects .  (12) Regional groups (Groups) should be established for the purpose of proposing and reviewing projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest , leading to the establishment of regional lists of projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest . In order to ensure broad consensus, those G roups should include and ensure close cooperation between Member States, national regulatory authorities, project promoters and relevant stakeholders. In the context of that cooperation, national regulatory authorities should, where necessary, advise G roups, inter alia, on the feasibility of the national regulatory aspects of proposed projects and on the feasibility of the proposed timetable for regulatory approval.  (13) In order to increase the efficiency of the network planning and project development process es , cooperation between the G roups should be strengthened. It is necessary that the Commission play an important role in facilitating that cooperation with a view to addressing the possible impact of projects developed within one region on other regions .  (14) In order to complement the G roups , several regional cooperation fora have been established with the support of the Commission. Regional cooperation within and between the fora and the Groups is a key tool to ensur e deeper integration of the European energy system. T he four High-Level Groups cover different European regions also with the involvement of third countries: the Baltic Energy Market Interconnection Plan (BEMIP), the North Seas Energy Cooperation (NSEC), the High-Level Group on Interconnections for South-West Europe (SWE) and the High-Level Group for Central and South-Eastern European Energy Connectivity (CESEC) . Regional cooperation in those fora has been successful in supporting monitoring and accelerating the implementation of key energy infrastructure projects of regional dimension and of market integration actions. Consequently, those regional cooperation fora sh ould be increasingly deployed to support the achievement of the objectives of this Regulation.  (15) A new Union list of projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest (“the Union list”) should be established every two years. Projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest that have been completed or that no longer fulfil the relevant criteria and requirements as set out in this Regulation should not appear on the subsequent Union list.  (16) Existing projects of common interest and existing projects of mutual interest that are to be included in the subsequent Union list should be subject to the same selection process for the establishment of regional lists and for the establishment of the Union list applied to proposed projects unless they have obtained an approval of the competent national regulatory authority or a final investment decision providing sufficient assurance of the construction of the projects or their construction is ongoing and they show sufficient progress in their annual report, in which case they should remain on the Union list .  (17) Whe re existing projects of common interest and existing projects of mutual interest that are to be included in the following Union list are subject to the same selection process for the establishment of regional lists and for the establishment of the Union list applied to proposed projects, the administrative burden should be reduced to the extent possible, for example by using project information submitted previously in the assessment, if still up to date .  (18) Projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest should comply with common, transparent and objective general and specific criteria in view of their contribution to the energy policy objectives. In order to be eligible for inclusion in the Union list, proposed electricity projects, with the exception of smart electricity grids and projects specifically designed to provide protection and resilience to existing critical network elements , should be part of the latest available Union-wide ten-year network development plan. Likewise, proposed hydrogen and electrolyser projects should be part of the latest available Union-wide ten-year network development plan.  (19) S ustainability in terms of the integration of renewable energy sources into the grid or the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, as relevant, is a key criterion for ensur ing that trans-European energy networks policy is coherent with the Union’s targets for energy and climate and the 2050 climate neutrality objectives, taking into account the specificities of each Member State in reaching the climate neutrality objective. To this end, sustainability is one of the assessment criteria to be applied for all project categories.  (20) There is a growing need for stronger market integration and interconnectivity of the networks of the Union with those of the European Economic Area (EEA) and the Energy Community. Therefore, the benefits and costs of projects of mutual interest between a Member State and a country in the EEA or a Energy Community  contracting party should be considered cumulatively for the Union and for the countr y concerned in the EEA or the contracting part y concerned in the Energy Community .  (21) The Union should facilitate infrastructure projects linking Union networks directly with third-country networks which are mutually beneficial and necessary for the energy transition and the achievement of the climate targets, and which also meet the specific criteria of the relevant infrastructure categories pursuant to this Regulation . T o reinforce the focus on cross-border projects and to maintain complementarity with the U nion ’s external policy, in the case of projects of mutual interest , the projects should directly connect a Member State with the first electricity network connection point or the first hydrogen or carbon dioxide connection point in the third country.  (22) As regards projects of mutual interest related to electricity network s , only interconnection projects linking energy systems should be eligible, provided that their transfer capacity could be fully used for market exchanges. It is the responsibility of the respective transmission system operators (TSOs) to assess in advance the impacts of any projects on the grid security and stability in order to confirm that the project can be fully integrated into the electricity networks of the countries concerned .  (23) It is necessary to ensure that projects of mutual interest, which are granted priority treatment, genuinely advance the Union’s internal market, security of supply and climate neutrality objectives . Therefore, p rojects of mutual interest should be eligible for inclusion in the Union list only where the policy framework of a third country invo lved has a high level of convergence and is supported by enforcement mechanisms , and such projects demonstrate a contribution to the Union’s and the third countries’ overall energy and climate policy objectives in terms of security of supply and decarbonisation.  (24) A high level of convergence of the policy framework should be presumed for the EEA or Energy Community contracting p arties or can be demonstrated in case of other third countries through bilateral agreements that include relevant provisions on climate and energy policy objectives on decarbonisation and further assessed by the appropriate G roup with the support of the Commission. In addition, the third country with which the Union cooperates in the development of projects of mutual interest should facilitate a similar timeline for accelerated implementation and other policy support measures, as provided for in this Regulation.  (25) The third country involved should ensure that the section of the project of mutual interest located in the third country and any additional investments necessary for the total benefits of the project of mutual interest to be implemented , such as internal grid reinforcements, are also treated as a priority and are timely deployed to ensure full use of the project.  (26) In order to ensure that projects for the storage of carbon dioxide which involve third countries contribute to cross-border carbon dioxide transport and storage in a manner consistent with the Union’s climate and environmental requirements , such projects should only be eligible if they are necessary for the functioning of cross-border transport and storage of carbon dioxide and where the third country maintains and effectively enforces an adequate legal framework. This legal framework in the third country should ensure the application of standards and safeguards that prevent carbon dioxide leaks and that guarantee the safety and effectiveness of the permanent storage of carbon dioxide for the protection of climate, human health and ecosystems. Those standards and safeguards should provide a level of protection at least equivalent to that laid down in Union law. It should be presumed that the EEA or Energy Community Contracting Parties meet those standards and safeguards.  (27) Projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest should be implemented as quickly as possible and should be closely monitored by the national competent authorities, the Agency and the Groups , while duly observing the requirements for stakeholder participation and environmental legislation and keeping the administrative burden for project promoters to a minimum. Particular attention should be paid to the assessment of risks as regards climate adaptation and as regards physical and cyber security , building where ap p licable on the requirements of Directive (EU) 2022/2557 with regard to the resilience of critical entities and the requirements of D irective 2022/2555 of the European Parliament and of the Council 51 with regard to measures for a high level of c y bersecurity across the Union , and project promoters shou l d report to the national competent authorities on the measures taken resulting from the risks assessed. P roject promoters should also report on the compliance with environmental legislation and demonstrate that projects do ‘no significant harm’ to the environment within the meaning of Article 17 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council 52 . For existing projects of common interest having reached sufficient maturity, those considerations should be taken into account during project selection for the subsequent Union list by the G roups .  (28) The Commission should have the possibility to nominate European coordinators for projects facing particular difficulties or delays, in order to facilitate the implementation of projects which encounter difficulties.  (29) The permit - granting process should neither lead to administrative burdens which are disproportionate to the size or complexity of a project, nor create barriers to the development of the trans-European networks and market access.  (30) Projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest should be given priority status at national level to ensure rapid administrative treatment and urgent treatment in all judicial and dispute resolution procedures relating to them.  (31) Member States that currently do not attribute the highest possible national significance to energy infrastructure projects as regards the permit - granting process , are encouraged to consider introducing such a high national significance, in particular where this could lead to a quicker permit - granting process.  (32) Member States that do not currently have in place accelerated or urgent judicial procedures applicable to energy infrastructure projects should be encouraged to consider introducing such procedures, in particular by evaluating whether that would lead to the quicker implementation of such projects.  (33) Projects concerning hydrogen assets, electrolyser facilities and carbon dioxide assets contribute to energy and climate goals, including with regard to the need to accelerate the deployment of renewable energy and its integration in their energy mix. Therefore, a ll projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest concerning hydrogen, electrolyser facilities, and carbon dioxide assets should be considered to be of public interest from an energy policy perspective , and it should be possible for Member States to consider them as being of overriding public interest , except for cultural heritage and where there is clear evidence that those projects have significant adverse effects on the environment which cannot be mitigated or compensated for .  (34) Due to their role integrating renewable energy assets, flexibility solution s , energy storage and electrification in general, electricity infrastructure projects are considered essential to reach climate neutrality . Therefore, until the Union climate neutrality target is achieved, such projects should be presumed to be of overriding public interest and to serve public health and safety whe re balancing competing legal interests, except for cultural heritage and where there is clear evidence that those projects have significant adverse effects on the environment which cannot be mitigated or compensated for , as provided for in Directive (EU) 2019/944 of the European Parliament and of the Co uncil 53 .  (35) Due to their importance to reach climate neutrality, and their strategic importance as project s o n the Union list, it should be possible for Member States to allow for projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest concerning electricity 54 that have been expressly included in a National Development Plan which was subject to a strategic environmental assessment in accordance with Directive 2001/42 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 55 , and, if it is likely to have a significant impact on Natura 2000 sites, to the appropriate assessment pursuant to Article 6(3) of Directive 92/43/ EEC , to be exempted from environmental impact assessments under Directive 2011/92/ EU, from assessments of their implications on species protection pursuant to Article 12(1) of Directive 92/43/EEC and to Article 5 of Directive 2009/147/EC , and from assessments of their implications for Natura 2000 s ites. Such exemptions should be possible until climate neutrality is achieved.  (36) In order to mitigate any possible impact of such exemptions, following the screening Member State s’ competent authorities should ensure that appropriate and proportionate mitigation measures are applied , considering the use of the best available technologies . W here it is not possible to apply such mitigation measures , competent authorities should ensure that project promoters adopt appropriate compensatory measures to address those effects, which, if other proportionate compensatory measures are not available, may include the payment of monetary compensation for species protection programmes. In addition , where a project is likely to have significant negative effects on the environment of another Member State, the national competent authorit ies should ensure that the Member States concerned ha ve cooperated to identify measures to avoid the significant impacts, or, where needed, to mitigate or compensate them.  (37) In order to speed up the deployment of the trans-European energy network , the conditions for applying specific derogations as set out in Union environmental legislation should be clear . In particular, when assessing whether there are satisfactory alternative solutions to energy projects , the scope of such assessment should be limited to alternative solutions that ensure the achievement of the same objective within the same or similar timeframe and without resulting in significantly higher costs. When comparing the timeframe and the cost of satisfactory alternative solutions, the relevant authorities should be able to take into account the need to deploy projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest in an accelerated and cost-effective manner in accordance with the priorities set out in their integrated national energy and climate plans and updates thereof submitted to the Commission pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999.  (38) Similarly, w hen applying the relevant derogation provided for in Directive 92/43/EEC, it is appropriate that the relevant authorities may , in justified cases and where it can be reasonably demonstrated that the plan or project would not irreversibly affect , before the measures are put into place , the overall coherence of the Natura 2000 network , the environmental integrity of the site is preserved and a high level of protection of the Natura 2000 sites is ensured , allow that compensatory measures are carried out in parallel with the implementation of the plan or project .  (39) In order to reduce complexity, increase efficiency and transparency, and help enhance cooperation among Member States, Member States should ensure that there is one single competent authority responsible for facilitating and coordinating all permit - granting processes towards the issuing of a comprehensive decision, cooperating with other concerned authorities and national competent authorities of other Member States, acting as a sole point of contact for promotors mediating their contact with other authorities, and monitoring the development and delays of projects on the Union list.  (40) To increase the efficiency of procedures , national competent authorities should also be responsible for ensuring that , for hybrid transmission and generation projects , the timeline for permitting aligns to all assets of the project in a manner that expedites the permit-granting process for the generation and transmission assets.  (41) In order to simplify and expedite the permit - granting process for projects on the Union list located in two or more Member States , a unique point of contact amongst the national competent authorities should be jointly designated by the Member States concerned. Having a single authority facilitating the process, and issuing the final comprehensive decision, should lighten the administrative burden for project developers and reduce complexity, increase efficiency and speed up the permit - granting process, especially where Member States provide for joint procedures with aligned timelines and assessments. To ensure effective cross-border cooperation, the Commission should focus on identified interconnection priority projects strengthening the coordination and monitoring of their implementation and permitting. For that purpose , the Commission should support Member States in identifying joint procedures for an effective and efficient permit - granting process .  (42) Member States should be able to include in comprehensive decisions, where appropriate, decisions taken in the context of negotiations with individual landowners to grant access to, ownership of, or a right to occupy, property in the context of spatial planning, which determines the general land use of a defined region, including other developments such as highways, railways, buildings and nature protection areas and which is not undertaken for the specific purpose of the planned project and granting of operational permits. In the context of the permit - granting process, a project of common interest should be able to include related infrastructure to the extent that it is essential for the construction or functioning of the project.  (43) This Regulation, in particular the provisions on permit - granting, public participation and the implementation of projects of common interest, should apply without prejudice to Union and international law, including provisions to protect the environment and human health, and provisions adopted under the Common Fisheries Policy and Integrated Maritime Policy, in particular Directive 2014/89/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council 56 .  (44) It is essential that stakeholders, including civil society, are provided with information and are consulted, in order to ensure the success of projects and to limit objections to them. Despite the existence of established standards ensuring the participation of the public in environmental decision-making procedures, which apply fully to projects of common interest, additional measures should be required to ensure the highest possible standards of transparency and public participation in all relevant issues in the permit - granting process for projects of common interest. Where already covered by national rules under the same or higher standards as in this Regulation, the pre-consultation ahead of the permit-granting proce ss should be optional and duplication of legal requirements should be avoided .  (45) The correct and coordinated implementation of Directives 2001/42/EC and 2011/92/EU and , where applicable, of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Convention on access to information, public participation in decision-making and access to justice in environmental matters 57 , signed in Aarhus on 25 June 1998 (the ‘Aarhus Convention’), and of the Convention on environmental impact assessment in a transboundary context 58 , signed in Espoo on 25 February 1991 (the ‘Espoo Convention’), should ensure the harmonisation of the main principles for the assessment of environmental and climate effects, including in a cross-border context. The Commission has issued guidance to support Member States to streamline the environmental assessment procedures for energy infrastructure and to ensure the coherent application of environmental assessment procedures required under Union law for projects of common interest.  (46) It is important to streamline and improve the permit - granting process, while respecting, to the extent possible and with due regard to the principle of subsidiarity, national competences and procedures for the construction of new energy infrastructure. Given the urgency of developing energy infrastructures, the simplification of the permit - granting process should set a clear time limit for the decision of the relevant authorities regarding the construction of the project. That time limit should stimulate an efficient definition and handling of procedures. This Regulation should establish maximum time limits. However, Member States can strive to achieve shorter time limits where feasible, in particular, as regards projects such as smart grids, which may not require as complex a permit - gran ting process as the one for transmission infrastructure.  (47) The lack of resources of permit -granting authorities and the lack of digitalisation of permit - gran ting processes and data availability are bottlenecks slowing down permit - gran ting process es . Digitalisation and an appropriate use of artificial intelligen ce features are expected to speed up procedures and to increase efficiency of processes by allowing for faster handling of applications and increase transparency through improved access to information on procedural steps and requirements. However, digitalisation of permit-granting processes is lagging behind, with data often scattered across different competent authorities without unified digital processes or platforms, and without interoperability being ensured. That leads to lack of clarity on the status of the applications and hindering the identification of bottlenecks. Therefore, Member States should set up a digital platform at national level for all the steps of the permit-granting processes for renewable energy, storage and grid projects so that the digitalisation of procedures is uniform, interoperable and transparent maximising its benefits in terms of speeding up the permit -granting process . Such platform s should enable project promoters to file applications and check their status, attribute them to the competent authorities, and allow authorities to process them by having access to all relevant data and information , without the need for intermediate paper-based steps. In addition, such platform should allow for the extraction of statistics on the overall progress of permit -granting processes in Member States. Such digital platforms should rely on secure and interoperable means provided through European Digital Identity Wallets, in compliance with the requirements of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014, for natural persons and, in the future, with European Business Wallets, in compliance wit h [Regulation (EU) No XXX/20YY], for legal persons, for enabling electronic identification and authentication, signing or sealing of documents, submission of documents and sending or receiving notifications between competent authorities and economic operators  (48) The competent authorities should be responsible for ensuring compliance with the time limits established in this Regulation. Further, in line with the urgency t o deploy energy infrastructures, and the strategic importance of projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest to achieve the Union’s energy and climate goals and to the extent that the concept of tacit approval exists under national law, Member States should ensure that the lack of a reply by the national competent authorities within the deadline set out in this Regulation, or a lack of a reply by an authority concerned within the deadline established by the national competent authority, leads to the specific opinion, authorisation or permit being tacitly approved or answered positively , with the exception of environmental decisions, and that such conclusion is made public.  (49) The permit - granting process should provide for two procedures , namely the optional pre-application procedure where the work towards a complete application file is delivered and accepted by the national competent authority, and the mandatory statutory permit - granting procedure between the acceptance of the file and the moment the authorities render a comprehensive decision. Within the pre-application phase national competent authorities should carry out a series of tasks. They should screen the project and notify the project promoter of what authorisations, studies, permits and assessments are required to complete the permit - granting process, including the environmental assessments and mitigation or compensation measures that should be deployed. They should define the scope and level of detail of the documentation identified in the screening conclusions, making sure that no subsequent documentation is to be requested from the project promoter save for where a material change has occurred to the project or its surrounding environment that renders the conditions and assumptions used to determine the scope non-applicable. They should draw up a detailed schedule for the permit - granting process. After receiving the draft application file, including all the preparatory documents, they should decide whether the file is deemed complete or requires the missing information in accordance with what was identified at the pre-application procedure .  (50) Where it is considered efficient, the national competent authorities may design the permitting requirements for the permit - gran ting process and public consultations of a certain project to take place in phases, provided the permit - gran ting process is simplified and accelerated.  (51) This Regulation should apply only to the granting of permits for projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest, public participation therein and the regulatory treatment of the projects . Member States should nevertheless be able to adopt national provisions to apply the same or similar rules to other projects that do not have the status of projects of common interest or projects of mutual interest within the scope of this Regulation.  (52) The Union-wide ten-year network development plan process provides a solid basis for the identification of projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest. W hile the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity ( ENTSO for Electricity ) , the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas ( ENTSO for Gas ) , the European Network of Network Operators for Hydrogen ( ENNOH ) and TSOs continue to play an important role in the process, more streamlining and steering is required, in particular as regards defining the scenarios for the future, identifying long-term infrastructure gaps and energy infrastructure bottlenecks and addressing those gaps with most adequate solutions , to increase the political weight , pertinence and robustness of the process. Therefore, the Agency and the Commission should have an increased role in the process for drawing up the Union-wide ten-year network development plans pursuant to Regulations (EU) 2019/943 and (EU) 2024/1789 .  (53) Considering that the selected scenario and its underlying assumptions play a major role in the Union-wide network development planning process , the Commission should play a central role in defining it . That should help streamline the inputs and ensure better compliance with the Union’s policy targets . It is also appropriate for the Union-wide ten-year network development plans to be based on one central scenario, with possible sensitivit y analys es to the scenario in case of change of external conditions , because the main purpose of the scenario is to provide a common basis for the assessment of the infrastructure gaps and benefits of candidate projects of common interest and project of mutual interest . The increased importance of the central scenario require s close involvement of the ENTSO for Electricity, the ENNOH, and the ENTSO for Gas , the Member States and the Agency to ensure that relevant data and information is provided , and that the scenario is aligned with national developments. The Stakeholder Reference Group should continue providing coordinated stakeholder input and advice on scenario development.  (54) The process of identifying infrastructure needs should play a stro nger role in gu i ding planned infrastructure investments. Compared to current practice, the process should be broader and consider more thoroughly cross-sectoral links and non-wire solutions , in order to clearly identif y what solutions best serve the energy system in achieving the energy and climate goals. T he Agency should be more involved in setting the framework for the process and its verification to increase acceptance of the subsequent solutions necessary to address the gaps. The Agency should develop methodologies for the process of identifying infrastructure needs to be conducted by the ENTSO for Electricity and the ENNOH in order to ensure that the outcomes are sufficiently robust and in accordance with the principles set out in this Regulation . The ultimate endorsement of the needs identification report by the decision-making body of the TEN-E Group should be a strong signal to project promoters where the possible projects are needed .  (55) Making the process of identifying infrastructure needs more comprehensive and granular should enable better matchmaking of planned project s with the needs for transmission capacity expansion. It should also enable a follow-up process leading to identifying new solutions which could address unmatched needs. TSOs should be the primary entity to suggest possible projects to address the gaps , but alternative solutions coming from other stakeholders should also be considered. Therefore, a needs matching process should be an outcome of regional cooperation and involve re l e va nt stakeholders in the discussion s . The central role of the Commission in the process should enhance regional cooperation and involvement of Member States, national regulatory authorities, project promoters and other relevant stakeholders in the effort to come up with the most adequate projects, be it non-wire or infrastructure solutions to match any possible unaddressed needs. As a last resort, the Commission should have the right to launch a call for proposals to overcome insufficient progress in addressing persisting gaps. It should be ensured that eligible projects are included as soon as possible in the subsequent national development plans, Union-wide ten-year network development plan and the Union list.  (56) An energy system-wide cost-benefit analysis is necessary to ensure that infrastructure planning reflects the evolving needs of an integrated and decarbonised system, by consistently assessing all relevant costs and benefits in order to identify the most efficient solutions for achieving Union energy and climate objectives. Non-wire solutions , such as dynamic line and transformer rating, advanced power flow control systems or digital twin platforms sh ould play a greater role in addressing network needs both in operation al and expansion terms and should therefore also be covered by the energy system wide cost-benefit analysis .  (57) The Union-wide ten-year network development plan should provide a comprehensive overview of planned infrastructure projects having cross-border impacts in the Union. Non-wire and flexibility solutions should form an intrinsic part of the plan so that it provides a full picture of future investments necessary for optimal operation of the electricity and hydrogen networks. A specific consideration should also be given to projects improving security and resilience of the network.  (58) In carrying out their tasks preceding the adoption of the Union-wide ten-year network development plans, the ENTSO for Electricity and the ENNOH , the Agency and the Commission should conduct an extensive consultation process involving all relevant stakeholders. Those stakeholders should include the European entity for the cooperation of electricity distribution system operators in the European Union , associations involved in electricity, gas and hydrogen markets, heating and cooling, carbon capture and storage and carbon capture and utilisation stakeholders, independent aggregators, demand-response operators, organisations involved in energy efficiency solutions , industrial sectors including transport, digitalisation, and data, a s well as energy consumer associations, the European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change and civil society representatives , as relevant. The Stakeholder Reference Group has proven to be an effective forum of stakeholder cooperation and its further contribution to the Union wide ten-year network development plan should be supported. The consultation should be open and transparent and should be organised i n a timely manner to allow for stakeholders’ feedback in the preparation of key phases of the Union-wide ten-year network development plans, such as infrastructure gaps identification and the cost-benefit analysis methodology for project assessment. The ENTSO for Electricity and the ENNOH should give due consideration to the input received from stakeholders during consultations and should explain how they took that input into account when submitting final proposals .  (59) Energy i nfrastructure planning should properly reflect sector coupling and cross-linkages between energy carriers . T he scenarios ’ development , the process of identifying infrastructure needs and the methodologies for cost-benefit analys is should be based on an integrated, long-term and optimised ‘one energy system’ approach and modelling which us es common assumptions and consistent methodologies. G reater coordination of infrastructure planning across sectors should help prioritise and deploy new infrastructure solutions in a more optimal manner .  (60) The importance of ensuring that only infrastructure projects for which no reasonable alternative solutions exist may receive the status of project of common interest or project of mutual interest also entails that the ‘ energy efficiency first ’ principle should be taken into account in the energy infrastructure planning and in the work of the regional groups in establishing the regional lists of proposed projects. In accordance with the energy efficiency first principle, all relevant alternatives to new infrastructure for ensuring future infrastructure needs, should be considered. S pecial consideration should be given to non-wire or digital solution s, use of demand response or non-fossil flexibility, which could improve overall efficiency of the networks. To this aim, the se solutions should be considered with priority by system operators when assessing projects for system expansion. A cost-efficient utilisation of networks should also be incentivised, notably through the use of locational and time-of-use price signals in network charges and support schemes.  (61) To achieve the Union’s 2050 climate neutrality objective, the Union needs to significantly scale up renewable electricity generation. I nvestment in offshore renewable energy should be increased with the aim of reaching at least 350 GW of offshore renewable generation installed in accordance with the cumulative non-binding regional Member States offshore renewable goals updated in December 2024 and supported in the Commission Communication of 24 October 2023 entitled ‘Delivering on the EU offshore renewable energy ambitions’ 59 . The first Offshore network development plans (ONDPs) published by the ENTSO for Electricity in January 2024 made an important step forward by anchoring Member States offshore regional ambitions in offshore network planning. That should support the identification of cross-border offshore renewable projects , including hybrids and cross-border radials, to ensure an optimized and cost-efficient development of offshore networks at sea-basin level. Th e strategic long-term logic included in the ONDPs should be extended to onshore electricity grids, as well as hydrogen networks.  (62) The assessment of the benefits and costs of the priority offshore grid corridors for renewable energy should support Member States to carry out a preliminary cost-sharing analysis at priority offshore grid corridor level, in order to underpin the subsequent joint political commitments for cross-border offshore grid projects. The Commission guidance on collaborative investment frameworks for offshore projects of 27 June 2024 should inform the assessment of the benefits and costs of the priority offshore grid corridors for renewable energy and may be updated by the Commission, with the involvement of the Member States, relevant TSOs, the Agency and the national regulatory authorities, when considered relevant.  (63) The costs of the development, construction, operation and maintenance of projects of common interest should in general be borne by the users of the infrastructure. The cost allocation should ensure that end-users are not disproportionately burdened, especially where that could lead to energy poverty. Projects of common interest should be eligible for cross-border cost allocation where an assessment of market demand, or of the expected effects on tariffs, indicates that costs cannot be expected to be recovered by the tariffs paid by the infrastructure users.  (64) In an increasingly interconnected internal energy market, clear and transparent rules for cross-border cost-allocation are necessary in order to accelerate investment in cross-border infrastructure and in projects with a cross-border impact. As cross-border energy infrastructure becomes more integrated, more projects deliver benefits beyond the territories where they are built. That makes fair and transparent cost-sharing essential to avoid disproportionate burdens on local consumers. The discussion o n the appropriate allocation of costs should be based on the analysis of the costs and benefits of an infrastructure project carried out on the basis of a harmonised methodology for energy-system-wide analysis, using the central scenario and any sensitivity analysis established for the purpose of the Union-wide ten-year network development plans prepared pursuant to Regulations (EU) 2019/943 and (EU) 2024/1789 , allowing for a robust analysis of the contribution of the project of common interest or mutual interest to the Union energy polic ies of decarbonisation, market integration, competition, sustainability and security of supply. Member States and national regulatory authorities in which at least 10 % of the benefits of a project are located should participate in discussions on cost allocation to ensure that the project can be implemented and its benefits delivered. Furthermore, cross-border cost allocation agreements should consider ex-post arrangements to ensure fair and proportionate participation of non-host countries, provided that such adjustments are clearly defined and structured in a way that safeguards investment certainty.  (65) It is essential to ensure a stable financing framework for the development of projects of common interest while minimising the need for financial support, and at the same time to encourage interested investors, with appropriate incentives and financial mechanisms. In deciding on cross-border cost - allocation, national regulatory authorities should allocate efficiently incurred investment costs, as relevant in view of their national approaches and methodologies for similar infrastructure, across borders in their entirety and include them in the national tariffs . A fterwards, where relevant, national regulatory authorities should determine whether their impact on national tariffs could represent a disproportionate burden for consumers in their respective Member States. The national regulatory authorities should avoid the risks of double support for projects by taking into account actual or estimated charges and revenues. Those charges and revenues should be taken into account only in so far as they relate to the projects and are designed to cover the costs concerned.  (66) To facilitate discussions on cost-sharing between the relevant Member States and third countries a possibility of bundling projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest should be provided . By allowing groups of Member States to treat a project bundle as mutually beneficial, win-win solutions can be fostered , risks and transaction costs in negotiations reduced , and the likelihood of implementation can be increased . Additional support at Union level, for example through the C onnecting Europe Facility , or at regional level using congestion income, could further facilitate such agreements and promote the timely delivery of priority infrastructure.  (67) Regulation (EU) 2019/943 lays down, in Article 19(2), three priority objectives for the use of revenues resulting from the allocation of cross-zonal capacity, namely: (a) guaranteeing the actual availability of the allocated capacity, including firmness compensation; (b) maintaining or increasing cross-zonal capacities through the optimisation of existing interconnectors or by covering costs resulting from network investments relevant to reducing interconnector congestion; and (c) compensating offshore renewable electricity generation plant operators in the circumstances set out therein. TSO s should ensure that all three priority objectives are fulfilled, including the objective in point (b). In order to facilitate the financing of p rojects of c ommon i nterest and p rojects of m utual i nterest that reduce interconnector congestion and to bring predictability and transparency to discussions on cross-border cost allocation decisions pursuant to Article 16 of this Regulation, it is appropriate to require TSOs to set aside a limited share of congestion income for such investments. T hat requirement is without prejudice to the responsibility of TSO s to decide on funding priorities , under the supervision of regulatory authorities and in accordance with the methodology approved pursuant to Article 19(4) of Regulation (EU) 2019/943 . That requirement should not apply where it can be demonstrated that there is no need for additional cross-border capacity to be built at the borders of the Member State concerned.  (68) Where there is no TSO in a Member State, the references to TSOs throughout this Regulation should apply mutatis mutandis to distribution system operators (DSO).  (69) The internal energy market legislation requires that tariffs for access to networks provide appropriate incentives for investment. However, several types of projects of common interest are likely to have externalities that might not be fully captured in, and recovered through, the regular tariff system. In applying the internal energy market legislation, national regulatory authorities should ensure a stable and predictable regulatory and financial framework with incentives for projects of common interest, including long-term incentives, that are commensurate with the level of specific risk of the project. That framework should apply in particular to cross-border projects, innovative transmission technologies for electricity allowing for the large scale integration of renewable energy, of distributed energy resources or of demand response in interconnected networks, and energy technology and digitalisation projects, which are either likely to incur higher risks than similar projects located within one Member State or which promise higher benefits for the Union. Moreover, projects with high operational expenditure should also have access to appropriate incentives for investment. In particular, offshore grids for renewable energy, which serve the dual functionality of electricity interconnectors and connecting renewable offshore generation projects, are likely to incur higher risks than comparable onshore infrastructure projects, due to their intrinsic connection to generation assets which brings regulatory risks, financing risks such as the need for anticipatory investments, market risks and risks pertaining to the use of new innovative technologies.  (70) Regulation (EU) 2022/869 has demonstrated the added value of leveraging private funding through significant Union financial assistance to allow the implementation of projects of Union significance. In the light of the economic and financial situation and budgetary constraints, targeted support should continue under the multiannual financial framework, also with a view to de-risking projects and crowding in private investment, in order to maximise the impact of public funding and its benefits to Union citizens and to attract new investors into the energy infrastructure priority corridors and areas set out in A nnex I to this Regulation, while keeping the budgetary contribution of the Union to a minimum.  (71) Projects of common interest should be eligible for Union financial assistance for studies and, under certain conditions, for works pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2021/1153 of the European Parliament and of the Council 60 in the form of grants or innovative financial instruments to ensure that tailor-made support can be provided to those projects of common interest which are not viable under the existing regulatory framework and market conditions. It is important to avoid any distortion of competition, in particular between projects contributing to the achievement of the same Union priority corridor. Such financial assistance should ensure the necessary synergies with other Union funds available for financ ing smart energy distribution networks, and with the Union renewable energy financing mechanism established by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/1294 61 .  (72) A three-step logic should apply to investments in projects of common interest. First, the market should have the priority to invest. Second, where investments are not made by the market, regulatory solutions should be explored, the relevant regulatory framework should be adjusted where necessary, and the correct application of the relevant regulatory framework should be ensured. Third, where the first two steps are not sufficient to deliver the necessary investments in projects of common interest, it should be possible to grant Union financial assistance where the project of common interest fulfils the applicable eligibility criteria.  (73) Projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest should not be eligible for Union financial assistance where the project promoters, operators or investors are in one of the situations of exclusion referred to in Article 138 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 of the European Parliament and of the Council 62 , such as in cases of a conviction for fraud, corruption or conduct related to a criminal organisation. It should be possible to remove a project of common interest from the Union list if its inclusion in that list was based on incorrect information which was a determining factor for that inclusion, or if the project does not comply with Union law. For a project of common interest located in the Member States benefiting from a derogation under this Regulation, those Member States should ensure, when supporting any applications for financing pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2022/869 for such projects, that the projects do not benefit directly or indirectly persons or entities that are in one of the situation of exclusion as referred to in Article 138 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2024/2509 .  (74) Grants for works related to projects of mutual interest should be available under the same conditions as for projects of common interest where they contribute to the Union’s overall energy and climate policy objectives and where the decarbonisation objectives of the third country are consistent with the Paris Agreement.  (75) The Union should facilitate energy projects in disadvantaged, less connected, peripheral, outermost or isolated regions to enable access to the trans-European energy networks in order to accelerate the decarbonisation process and reduce dependency on fossil fuels .  (76) In accordance with the European Council conclusions of 4 February 2011 that no Member State should remain isolated from the European gas and electricity networks after 2015 or see its energy security jeopardised by lack of the appropriate connections, this Regulation aims to ensure access to the trans-European energy networks by ending the energy isolation of Cyprus and Malta, that are still not interconnected to the trans-European gas network. That objective should be attained by allowing projects under development or planning that have been granted the status of project of common interest under Regulation (EU) 2022/869 to maintain their status until Cyprus and Malta are interconnected to the trans-European gas network or until 31 Decembe r 2029, whichever is earliest . Apart from contributing to the development of the renewable energy market, the flexibility and resilience of the energy system, and the security of supply, those projects would ensure access to future energy markets, including hydrogen, and contribute to achieving the Union’s overall energy and climate policy objectives.  (77) To ensure consistency of proposed changes under this Regulation with the Union framework on electricity, gases and hydrogen markets, corresponding amendments are proposed to Articles 3 and 11 of Regulation ( EU) 2019/942 of the European Parliament and of the Council 63 , Article 48 of Regulation (EU) 2019/943 and Articles 60 and 61 of Regulation (EU) 2024/1789. Th ose amendments relate to the use of the central scenario in the Union-wide ten-year network development plan, consideration of non-wire solutions and other alternatives to system expansion and clarifying the time scope of the plans. Those Regulations should therefore be amended accordingly .  (78) In order to ensure the timely development of essential energy infrastructure projects for the Union, the third Union list of projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest should remain in force until the first Union list of projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest established pursuant to this Regulation enters into force. Moreover, to enable the development, monitoring and financing of the projects of common interest on the third Union list pursuant to the Regulation (EU) 2022/869 , certain provisions of Regulation (EU) 2022/869 should remain in force and produce effects until the entry into force of the first Union list of projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest established pursuant to this Regulation.  (79) In order to ensure that the Union list is limited to projects which contribute the most to the implementation of the strategic energy infrastructure priority corridors and areas set out in A nnex I to this Regulation, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission in order to amend the annexes to this Regulation so as to establish and review the Union list, while respecting the right of the Member States to approve projects on the Union list related to their territories.  (80) T h e power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission to develop the central scenario , which is a basis for the Union -level network planning.  (81) The power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty should be delegated to the Commission to specify the conditions under which TSOs may use congestion income and the conditions under which the objective of Article 19(2) , point (b) , of Regulation (EU) 2019/943 is considered adequately fulfilled .  (82) It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making 64 . In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States' experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts .  (83) The discussions in the G roups are instrumental for the Commission to adopt the delegated acts establishing the Union list. Therefore, it is appropriate that , to the extent possible, the European Parliament and the Council are informed about the results , and may send experts to the meetings of G roups in accordance with the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law Making. Taking into account the need to ensure the achievement of the objectives of this Regulation and, in view of the number of projects on Union lists so far, the total number of projects on the Union list should remain manageable and therefore should not significantly exceed 220.  (84) Therefore, R egulations (EU) 2019/942, (EU) 2019/943 and (EU) 2024/1789 should be amended accordingly , and Regulation (EU) 2022/ 869 should be repealed .  (85) Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely the development and interoperability of trans-European energy networks and connection to such networks that contribute to ensuring climate change mitigation, in particular achieving the Union’s targets for energy and climate and its climate neutrality objective by 2050 at the latest, and to ensuring interconnections, energy security, market and system integration, competition that benefits all Member States, and affordable energy prices, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the scale and effects of the proposed action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives ,  HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:  CHAPTER I  General provisions  Article 1  Subject matter and scope  1. This Regulation lays down guidelines for the timely development and interoperability of the priority corridors and areas of trans-European energy infrastructure (energy infrastructure priority corridors and areas) set out in Annex I , that contribute to ensuring climate change mitigation, in particular achieving the Union’s targets for energy and climate and its climate neutrality objective by 2050 at the latest, and to ensuring interconnections, energy security, market and system integration and competition that benefits all Member States, as well as affordability of energy prices.  2. In particular, this Regulation:  (a) provides for the identification of projects of common interest and of projects of mutual interest on the Union list ;  (b) facilitates the timely implementation of projects on the Union list by streamlining, coordinating more closely and accelerating permit - granting processes, and by enhancing transparency and public participation;  (c) provides rules for the cross-border allocation of costs and risk-related incentives for projects on the Union list;  (d) determines the conditions for eligibility of projects on the Union list for Union financial assistance.

CHAPTER II  Projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest  Article 3  Union list of projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest  1. Regional groups ( ‘ Groups ’ ) shall be established in accordance with the process set out in Section 1 of Annex III. The membership of each Group shall be based on each priority corridor and area and their respective geographical coverage as set out in Annex I. The Groups can merge or meet in different configurations as necessary. The cross-regional meeting configuration of all Groups shall be the TEN-E Group. Decision-making power in the Groups shall be restricted to Member States and the Commission (together referred to as ‘ the decision-making body ’ ) and shall be based on consensus.  2. The TEN-E Group shall adopt rules of procedure, having regard to the provisions set out in Annex III. Th o se rules of procedure shall apply to all Groups.  3. The decision-making body of each Group shall adopt a regional list of projects drawn up in accordance with : the process set out in Section 2 of Annex III ; the contribution of each project to implementing the energy infrastructure priority corridors and areas set out in Annex I ; and their fulfilment of the criteria set out in Article 4.  Where the decision-making body of a Group draws up its regional list:  (a) each individual proposal for a project shall require the approval of the Member States to whose territory the project relates; where a Member State does not give its approval, it shall present its substantiated reasons to the decision-making body ;  (b) it shall take into account advice from the Commission with the aim of having a manageable total number of projects on the Union list.  4. The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 2 3 to supplement this Regulation by establish i ng the Union list, subject to Article 172 , second paragraph, of the Treaty .  The Union list shall be established every two years, on the basis of the regional lists adopted by the decision-making bodies of the Groups established pursuant to Section 1, point (1), of Annex III, following the procedure set out in paragraph 3 of this Article.  The Commission shall adopt the delegated act establishing the first Union list pursuant to this Regulation by 30 November 2029.  If a delegated act adopted by the Commission pursuant to this paragraph cannot enter into force due to an objection expressed either by the European Parliament or the Council pursuant to Article 23(6), the Commission shall immediately convene the Groups in order to draw up new regional lists taking into account the reasons for the objection.

CHAPTER III  Permit-granting and public participation  Article 7  Priority status of projects on the Union list  1. The Union list shall establish, for the purposes of any decisions issued in the permit - granting process, the necessity of projects on the Union list from an energy policy and climate perspective , without prejudice to the exact location, routing or technology of the project .  The first subparagraph shall not apply to competing projects or to projects that have not reached a sufficient degree of maturity to provide a project specific cost-benefit analysis as referred to in Section 2, point (1)(d), of Annex III.  2. For the purpose of ensuring efficient administrative processing of the application files related to projects on the Union list, project promoters and all authorities concerned shall ensure that those files are treated in the most rapid way possible in accordance with Union and national law .  3. Projects on the Union list shall have the status of the highest national significance possible, where such a status exists in national law and be treated as such in the permit - granting process, including those relating to environmental assessments, in spatial planning, and in obtaining rights of way and expropriation of necessary land .  4. All dispute resolution procedures, litigation, appeals and judicial remedies related to projects on the Union list in front of any national courts, tribunals, panels, including mediation or arbitration, where they exist in national law, shall be treated as urgent, if and to the extent to which national law provides for such urgency procedures .  5. With regard to the environmental impacts addressed in Article 6(4) of Directive 92/43/EEC and Article 4(7) of Directive 2000/60/EC, provided that all the conditions set out in those Directives are fulfilled, projects on the Union list falling under the infrastructure categories referred to in points (2), (3), and (4) of Annex II to this Regulation shall be considered as being of public interest from an energy policy perspective, and may be considered as having an overriding public interest .  Where the opinion of the Commission is required in accordance with Article 6(4) of Directive 92/43/EEC, the Commission and the national competent authority referred to in Article 8 of this Regulation shall ensure that the decision with regard to the overriding public interest of a project is taken within the time limits set in Article 10(1) and (2) of this Regulation .  The first and second subparagraphs shall not apply to competing projects or to projects that have not reached a sufficient degree of maturity to provide a project specific cost-benefit analysis as referred to in Section 2, point (1)(d), of Annex III.  6. U ntil climate neutrality is achieved at Union level , in the permit-granting procedure, the planning, construction and operation of projects falling within the infrastructure category referred to in Annex II point (1) fall under the provision of A rticle 8( 8 ) of Directive (EU) 2019/944 and are presumed as being in the overriding public interest and serving public health and safety when balancing legal interests in individual cases for the purposes of Article 6(4) and Article 1 6 (1), point (c), of Directive 92/43/EEC, Article 4(7) of Directive 2000/60/EC and Article 9(1), point (a), of Directive 2009/147/EC . Member States may, in duly justified and specific circumstances, restrict the application of the presumption to certain parts of their territory, to certain types of technology or to projects with certain technical characteristics.  Member States shall ensure that, in the planning and permit-granting process, the construction and operation of projects falling under the infrastructure category referred to in point (1) of Annex II are given priority when balancing legal interests in individual cases for other purposes than the ones referred in the first subparagraph with the exception of cultural heritage on the basis of legal criteria to ensure harmonized implementation.  The first subparagraph shall not apply to competing projects or to projects that have not reached a sufficient degree of maturity to provide a project specific cost-benefit analysis as referred to in Section 2, point (1)(d), of Annex III.  7. Until climate neutrality is achieved at Union level , with regard to projects on the Union list falling under the infrastructure categories referred to in point (1) of Annex II to this Regulation which are expressly included in a National Development Plan that has been subject to a strategic environmental assessment in accordance with Directive 2001/42, and, where it is likely to have a significant impact on Natura 2000 sites, to the appropriate assessment pursuant to Article 6(3) of Directive 92/43/EEC, Member States may , insofar as the project complies with and does not go beyond the framework of the assessed National Development Plan :  (a) exempt those projects from the environmental impact assessment under Article 2(1) of Directive 2011/92/EU, and  (b) exempt those projects from an assessment of their implications for Natura 2000 sites pursuant to Article 6(3) of Directive 92/43/EEC and from the assessment of their implications on species protection pursuant to Article 12(1) of Directive 92/43/EEC and to Article 5 of Directive 2009/147/EC .  For projects located in, or crossing, Natura 2000 sites and areas designated under national protection schemes for nature and biodiversity conservation, the exemptions referred to in the first subparagraph shall only be applicable in case there are no proportionate alternatives for their deployment, taking into account the objectives of the site. Projects referred to in Annex II point 1(c) shall exclude Natura 2000 sites and areas designated under national protection schemes.  8. Where Member States apply the exemptions under paragraph 7 , they shall ensure that rules on effective mitigation measures to be adopted for the projects on the Union list falling under the infrastructure categories referred to in Annex II point (1) are identified based on the National Development Plan, in order to avoid the adverse environmental impact that may arise or, where that is not possible, to significantly mitigate it. Member States shall ensure that the appropriate mitigation measures are applied in a timely manner to ensure compliance with the obligations laid down in Article 6(2) of Directive 92/43/EEC and Article 4(1), point (a)(i), of Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and to avoid deterioration and achieve good ecological status or good ecological potential in accordance with Article 4(1), point (a), of Directive 2000/60/EC.  Compliance with the rules referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph and the implementation of the appropriate mitigation measures by the individual projects shall result in the presumption that projects are not in breach of the provisions mentioned in that subparagraph, without prejudice to paragraph 10 of this Article.  9. Member States shall ensure public participation regarding the National Development Plan in accordance with Articles 6 and 7 of Directive 2001/42/EC, including identifying the public affected or likely to be affected as well as the Member States that may be affected by the implementation of that Plan and the projects on the Union list falling under the infrastructure categories referred to in point (1) of Annex II to this Regulation included in that Plan.  10. For projects for which Member States decide to apply exemptions under paragraph 7 , the competent authorities shall carry out a screening to identify:  (a) if the project is likely to give rise to significant adverse effects, which were not identified during the environmental assessment of the National Development Plan carried out pursuant to Directive 2001/42/EC and, where relevant, to Directive 92/43/EEC.  (b) if the project falls within the scope of Article 7 of Directive 2011/92/EU and Article 2 of the Convention on environmental impact assessment in a transboundary context due to its likelihood of significant effects on the environment in another Member State or due to the request of a Member State which is likely to be significantly affected.  This screening referred to in the first subparagraph shall be finalised within 45 days from the notification of the project promoter referred to in paragraph 5 of Article 10.  11. Where a project on the territory of a Member State is likely to have significant effects on the environment of other Member States, the Member State where the project is located shall ensure the application of Article 7 of Directive 2011/92/EU and Articles 2 to 7 of the Convention on environmental impact assessment in a transboundary context.  12. Where the screening process identifies a project to be highly likely to give rise to significant unforeseen adverse effects as referred to in paragraph 10 of this Article, the competent authorities shall inform the project promoter that assessments referred to in points (a) and (b) of paragraph 7 of this Article are re quired and ensure that on the basis of existing data, appropriate and proportionate mitigation measures are applied for these projects to ensure compliance with Articles 12(1) of Directive 92/43/EEC and Article 5 of Directive 2009/147/EC. Where it is not possible to apply such mitigation measures, the competent authorities shall ensure that project promoters adopt appropriate compensatory measures to address those effects, which, if other proportionate compensatory measures are not available, may take the form of a monetary compensation for species protection programmes, in order to secure or improve the conservation status of the species affected.  13. When assessing whether satisfactory alternative solutions to projects on the Union list falling under the infrastructure categories referred to in points (2), (3) and (4) of Annex II to this Regulation , exist for the purposes of Articles 6(4) and Article 16(1) of Directive 92/43/EEC, Article 4(7), point (d), of Directive 2000/60/EC and Article 9(1) of Directive 2009/147/EC, the condition of having no satisfactory alternatives shall be fulfilled if there are no satisfactory alternative solutions capable of achieving the same objective of the project in question, in terms of the development of the same capacity through the same technology within the same or similar timeframe and without resulting in significantly higher costs.  14. When implementing compensatory measures for projects on the Union list falling under the infrastructure categories referred to in points (2), (3) and (4) of Annex II to this Regulation for the purpose of Article 6(4) of Directive 92/43/EEC, Member States may , in justified cases and where it can be reasonably demonstrated that the plan or project would not irreversibly affect the ecological processes essential for maintaining the structure and functions of the site and would compromise the overall coherence of the Natura 2000 network before compensatory measures are put into place, allow for such compensatory measures to be carried out in parallel with the implementation of the project. Member States may allow , in accordance with the precautionary principle, for those compensatory measures to be adapted over time, depending on whether the significant negative effects are expected to arise in the short, medium or long term.  15. Regarding the assessment , satisfactory alternative solutions to projects falling under the infrastructure category referred to in point (1) of Annex II to this Regulation and the implementation of compensatory measures for those projects, Article 8a of Directive (EU) 2019/944 shall apply.  Article 8  Organisation of the permit-granting process  1.

In case of update to, or changes of, the designated national competent authority, Member States shall notify the Commission as soon as the change is decided and inform when such changes produce effects.  2. The responsibilities of the national competent authority referred to in paragraph 1 and the tasks related to it may be delegated to another authority, per project on the Union list or per particular category of projects on the Union list, or per geographical area, provided that:  (a) the national competent authority notifies the Commission of that delegation and the information therein is made easily available to the public including on the website referred to in Article 9(7);  (b) only one authority is responsible per project, or category of projects, on the Union list, and it is the sole point of contact for the project promoters, taking upon all responsibilities in the process leading to the comprehensive decision within the legal deadline provided in Article 10(2) and coordinates the submission of all relevant documents and information including to any other authority concerned;  (c) irrespective of the delegation , the national competent authority remains responsible to aggregate the reports submitted by project promoters in accordance with Article 5(4) and report to the Agency and relevant Groups in accordance with Article 5(5).  The national competent authority may also retain the responsibility to establish time limits, without prejudice to the time limits set in Article 10(1) and (2).  3. The national competent authority shall ensure the issuing of the comprehensive decision within the time limits set out in Article 10(1) and (2).  Member States shall choose among the following schemes, taking into account which scheme is most effective in light of national law, national planning and permit-granting process specificities, and whether it can be implemented in a manner that contributes to the most efficient and timely issuing of the comprehensive decision:  (a) integrated scheme:  (i) the comprehensive decision shall be issued by the national competent authority and shall be the sole legally binding decision arising from the statutory permit - granting proce ss ;  (ii) w here other authorities are concerned by the project, they may, in accordance with national law, give their opinion as input to the procedure, which shall be taken into account by the national competent authority;  (b) coordinated scheme:  (i) the comprehensive decision comprises multiple individual legally binding decisions issued by the several authorities concerned and is coordinated centrally by the national competent authority ;  (ii) t he national competent authority may establish a working group where all authorities concerned are represented in order to draw up the screening or the detailed schedule for the permit - granting process in accordance with Article 10( 9 ), point (b), and to monitor and coordinate its implementation ;  (iii) the national competent authority shall, after consulting the other authorities concerned, establish on a case-by-case basis a reasonable time limit within which the individual decisions shall be issued with the aim to minimise the duration of the process without prejudice to time limits set out in Article 10(1) and (2) ;  (iv) the national competent authority shall be able to take an individual decision on behalf of another authority concerned, where the decision by that authority is not delivered within the set time limit and where the delay cannot be adequately justified. The national competent authority may also disregard an individual decision of another authority concerned if it considers that the decision is not sufficiently substantiated with regard to the underlying evidence presented by th at authority concerned ;  (c) collaborative scheme:  (i) the comprehensive decision shall be comprised of multiple individual legally binding decisions issued by several authorities concerned and coordinated by the national competent authority ;  (ii) t he national competent authority may establish a working group where all authorities concerned are represented in order to draw up the screening or the detailed schedule for the permit - granting process in accordance with Article 10( 9 ), and to monitor and coordinate its implementation ;  (iii) the national competent authority shall, after consulting the other authorities concerned, establish on a case-by-case basis a reasonable time limit, within which the individual decisions shall be issued with the aim to minimise the duration of the process, without prejudice to the time limits set in Article 10(1) and (2 ) ;  (iv) the national competent authority shall monitor compliance with the time limits by the authorities concerned and, in case of delays, shall take measures with the aim to minimise the duration of the process ;  (v) w here a Member State chooses the collaborative scheme, it shall inform the Commission of its reasons.  Authorities concerned shall, in accordance with the permitting scheme chosen by Member States, either delegate the necessary competences to the national competent authority or facilitate cooperation and collaboration with the national competent authority to ensure the issuing of the comprehensive decision within the time limits set in Article 10(1) and (2).  Where an authority concerned does not expect to deliver an individual decision within the set time limit, that authority shall immediately inform the national competent authority, providing reasons for the delay. Subsequently, the national competent authority shall set another time limit within which that individual decision shall be issued, in compliance with the overall time limits set in Article 10(1) and (2).  4. Member States may apply the schemes set out in paragraph 3 to onshore and offshore projects on the Union list.  In the case of projects on the Union list that are intrinsically linked to generation assets, such as the projects included in the infrastructure categories provided by points (1)(b) or (h) of Annex II, the national competent authority shall be responsible for coordinating the permit-granting process of the respective project on the Union list with the permitting of the generation assets so that the timelines are cohesive and together aim at the most efficient and timely permitting of all assets related to the project.  5. Where a project on the Union list is located i n the territory of two or more Member States, their respective national competent authorities shall jointly appoint one of them to act as a unique point of contact, responsible for facilitating the exchange of information between the national competent authorities and other authorities concerned on the permit - granting process, as well as, issuing the final comprehensive decisions in cooperation with the other national competent authorities concerned.  Member States shall endeavour to provide a joint procedure which facilitates the cooperation between their respective national competent authorities concerned, create procedural synergies and align timelines to facilitate the permit-granting process for projects, particularly with regard to the assessment of environmental impacts, and the public consultations required under Article 9.  Upon request from Member States, the Commission shall play the role of a facilitator to support cooperation between concerned national competent authorities. The Commission shall facilitate agreement on a unified joint procedure by providing an opinion and making recommendations on procedural aspects.  Article 9  Transparency and public participation  1. By 24 October 2027, the Member State or national competent authority shall, where necessary, in collaboration with other authorities concerned, publish an updated manual of procedures for the permit - granting process applicable to projects on the Union list to include at least the information specified in point (1) of Annex VI. The manual shall not be legally binding, but it shall refer to or quote relevant legal provisions. The national competent authorities shall, where relevant, cooperate and find synergies with the authorities of neighbouring countries with a view to align timelines and facilitating the permit - granting process for projects, including for the development of the manual of procedures.  2. Without prejudice to public participation requirements under environmental law, the Aarhus Convention, the Espoo Convention and relevant Union law, all parties involved in the permit - granting process shall follow the principles for public participation set out in point (3) of Annex VI.  3. The project promoter shall, within an indicative period of three months following the start of the permit - granting process pursuant to Article 10( 5 ), draw up and submit a concept for public participation to the national competent authority, following the process outlined in the manual referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article and in accordance with the guidelines set out in Annex VI.  4. The national competent authority shall request modifications or approve the concept for public participation within three months of receipt of the concept, taking into consideration, without the need for repetition, of any form of public participation and consultation that took place before the start of the permit - granting process, to the extent that such public participation and consultation has fulfilled the requirements of this Article.  Where the project promoter intends to make significant changes to an approved concept for public participation, it shall inform the national competent authority thereof. In that case the national competent authority may request additional modifications.  5. Where it is not already required under national law , the project promoter shall carry out at least one early-stage public consultation, before the submission of the final and complete permitting application to the national competent authority pursuant to Article 10( 10 ). The public consultation may be carried out in combination with any public consultation after submission of the request for development consent pursuant to Article 6(2) of Directive 2011/92/EU.  6. The public consultation required in the previous paragraph shall comply with the minimum requirements set out in point (5) of Annex VI and shall inform the stakeholders referred to in point (3)(a) of Annex VI about the project at an early stage and shall help to identify the most suitable location , trajectory or technology, including, where relevant, in view of adequate climate adaptation and security considerations for the project, all impacts relevant under Union and national law, and the relevant issues to be addressed in the application file.  7. Without prejudice to the procedural and transparency rules in Member States, the project promoters shall publish on the website referred to in paragraph 10 a report summarising the results of activities relate d to public participation as regards the project including any activities pre-dating the early public consultation,  and explaining how the opinions expressed in the public consultations were taken into account, showing the amendments made in the location, trajectory and design of the project, or providing reasons why such opinions have not been taken into account.  The project promoter shall submit the report together with the application file to the national competent authority. The comprehensive decision shall take due account of the result of this report.  8. For cross-border projects involving two or more Member States, the public consultations carried out pursuant to paragraph 5 in each of the Member States concerned shall, to the extent possible, take place within a period of no more than two months from each other, and, where possible, be combined.  9. For projects likely to have a significant transboundary impact in one or more neighbouring Member States, to which Article 7 of Directive 2011/92/EU and the Espoo Convention are applicable, the relevant information shall be made available to the national competent authorities of the neighbouring Member States concerned. The national competent authorities of the neighbouring Member States concerned shall indicate, in the notification process where appropriate, whether they, or any other authority concerned, wishes to participate in the relevant public consultation procedures.  10. The project promoter shall establish and regularly update a dedicated project website with relevant information about the project of common interest, which shall be linked to the Commission website and the transparency platform referred to in Article 2 6 and which shall meet the requirements specified in point (6) of Annex VI. National competent authorities shall check the fulfilment of this obligation by the project promoters and take measures ensuring compliance whe r e necessary.  Article 10  Duration and implementation of the permit-granting process  1. The permit - granting process shall provide for the following two procedures:  (a) the optional pre-application procedure, covering the period between the start of the permit - granting process and the acceptance of the submitted complete application file by the national competent authority, which shall take place within a maximum period of 24 months;  (b) the mandatory statutory permit - granting procedure, covering the period from the date of acceptance of the submitted complete application file until the date of the comprehensive decision, which shall not exceed 18 months.  With regard to the first subparagraph, point (b), where possible, Member States may provide for a statutory permit-granting procedure that is shorter than 18 months.  2. The national competent authority shall ensure that the combined duration of the two procedures referred to in paragraph 1 does not exceed a period of 42 months.  However, where the national competent authority considers that one or both of the procedures will not be completed within the time limits set out in paragraph 1, it may extend one or both of those time limits before their expiry and on a case-by-case basis. The national competent authority shall not extend the combined duration of the two procedures for more than six months other than in exceptional circumstances.  Where the national competent authority extends the time limits, it shall inform the Group concerned of the reasons for such extension and present it with the measures taken, or to be taken, for the conclusion of the permit-granting process, with the least possible delay. The Group may request that the national competent authority reports regularly on the progress achieved in that regard and provide reasons for any delays.  3. Member States shall ensure that the national competent authorities referred to in Article 8(1) have adequate technical, financial and human resources to render a comprehensive decision within the timeframe indicated in Article 10(2) .  4. Member States shall ensure that, i n the permit-granting procedure referred to in paragraph 1, :  (a) the lack of reply by the national competent authorities within the deadline established in paragraph 2 results in the comprehensive decision to be considered as approved ;  (b) the lack of reply by other authorities concerned within the reasonable time limit established by a national competent authority in accordance with Article 8(3), results in their specific opinion , authorisation or permit to be considered as granted or answered positively .  This paragraph does not produce effects for environmental decisions, and where the principle of administrative tacit approval does not exist in the legal system of the Member State concerned.  All decisions shall be made publicly available, including final decisions granted tacitly following the lack of reply by the relevant competent authorities or authorities concerned.  5. When requesting the start of the permit - granting process, the project promoters shall notify the project to the national competent authority of each Member State where the project is located, including in Member States where the project crosses their exclusive economic zone, in written or electronic form and include a reasonably detailed outline of the project.  Within one month of receipt of the notification, the national competent authority shall, in electronic form, either:  (a) i ssue an acknowledge ment of the receipt ; or  (b) i f the project is not considered to be mature enough to enter the permit - granting process , reject the notification, and provide the reasons for its decision including on behalf of other authorities concerned.  The date of the acknowledgement of receipt shall mark the start of the permit-granting process. Where two or more Member States are concerned, the date of the acceptance of the last notification by the national competent authority concerned shall mark the start of the permit-granting process.  Member States shall ensure that dedicated digital platforms are established to manage permitting applications, permitting processes, ongoing permitting decisions, and decisions issued in an easily accessible format.  Those platforms shall provide access to the relevant environmental and geological data and decisions available in the central online portal referred to in Article 10(3) of Regulation [xxxxx] 66 of the European Parliament and of the Council.  6. National competent authorities shall ensure that the permit - granting process is accelerated in accordance with this Chapter for each category of projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest. To that end, the national competent authorities shall adapt their requirements for the start of the permit - granting process and for the acceptance of the complete application file, in accordance with the relevant project category, their nature, dimension, lack of requirement for environmental assessment, or any other assessments under national law, or the fact that they may require less authorisations and approvals to reach the ready-to-build phase.  As such, national competent authorities may decide that the pre-application procedure referred to in paragraphs 1 and 6 of this Article is not necessary in case the project promoter does not require this period to perform studies, assessments and gather data for completing their permitting application file.  7. The national competent authorities shall take into consideration , in the screening for establishing the requirements for the permit - granting process , any studies conducted and permits or authorisations issued up to five years before the project entered the permit - granting process in accordance with this Article, including assessments conducted for the deployment of other projects that are relevant and can be reused, and shall not require unnecessary or duplicate studies , assessments, permits or authorisations.  8. In Member States where the determination of a route or location undertaken solely for the specific purpose of a planned project, including the planning of specific corridors for grid infrastructures, cannot be included in the permit - gran ting process leading to the comprehensive decision, the corresponding decision shall be taken within a separate period of six months, starting on the date of submission of the final and complete application documents by the project promoter.  9. The pre-application procedure shall include : the screening and scoping of the required studies, reports and documentation expected from the project promoter ; the drawing up of the detailed schedule ; and , the verification of the draft application file , under the following steps :  (a) a s soon as possible and no later than three months following the notification by the project promoter referred to in paragraph 5, the national competent authority shall determine, and notify the project promoter of the authorisations, permits and assessments required to complete permit - granting process .  The notification made by the national competent authority shall include the checklist referred to in point (1)(e) of Annex VI, and where relevant, its content shall be established in cooperation with the other authorities concerned and with national competent authorities in the other Member States where the project is located, including if the project crosses their exclusive economic zone.  Where applicable the notification shall detail the conditions for the project to benefit from the exemption of Article 7(7) and identify:  (i) whether the project is highly likely to give rise to significant unforeseen adverse effects in view of the environmental sensitivity of the geographical areas where it is planned, which were not identified during the environmental assessment of the National Development Plans carried out pursuant to Directive 2001/42/EC and, where relevant, to Directive 92/43/EEC ;  (ii) the appropriate and proportionate mitigation measures, or monetary compensation for species protection programs applicable to the project in accordance with Article 7(8) ;  (iii) whether any part of the project is likely to produce significant effects on the environment in another Member State ; in such a case the national competent authority of the Member State in which the project is located shall ensure the application of Article 7 of Directive 2011/92/EU and Articles 2 to 7 of the Convention on environmental impact assessment in a transboundary context ;  (b) t he notification shall also indicate whether the national competent authority approves, or amends, the concept for public participation submitted by the project promoter in accordance with Article 9(3). During the screening period, the national competent authority shall, in cooperation with other authorities concerned, determine the scope and level of detail of the studies, reports and documentation s, including assessments required for the environmental permitting of the project, that the project promoter is expected to produce and submit as part of the complete application file.  Neither the national competent authority, nor any of the authorities concerned shall subsequently request any additional information, studies, reports or assessments than the ones determined in this initial screening process, except where a material change has occurred to the project or its surrounding environment. Where such a material change occurs, the national competent authority may request additional information from the project promoter based on a reasoned justification;  (c) t he national competent authority shall draw up, in close cooperation with the project promoter and other authorities concerned and the national competent authorities in the other Member States where the project is located, including if the project crosses their exclusive economic zone, and taking into account the results of the activities carried out under point (a) of this paragraph, a detailed schedule for the permit - granting process in accordance with the guidelines set out in point (2) of Annex VI ;  (d) u pon receipt of the draft application file, the national competent authority may , on its own behalf or on behalf of other authorities concerned, request the project promoter to submit missing information relating to the requested elements referred to in point (a) within a maximum deadline of one month.  The pre-application procedure shall include the preparation of any environmental reports by the project promoters, as necessary, including the climate adaptation and cyber and physical security documentation and assessments .  In cooperation with the project promoter and, as necessary, other authorities concerned or other national competent authorities of other Member States where the project is located, including if the project crosses their exclusive economic zone, the national competent authority may design the requirements for the permit-granting process of a certain project, and the public consultation timeline set out in point (4) of Annex VI, in phases, provided it does not delay the overall development of the project and ensures that the permit-granting process is simplified and accelerated. The maximum deadlines of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall apply for each of the phases.  Within one month of submission of the missing information referred to in the first subparagraph, point (d), the competent authority shall accept for examination the complete application in written or electronic form or on dedicated digital platforms, starting the statutory permit-granting procedure referred to in paragraph 1, point (b).  10. The project promoter shall cooperate in good faith with the national competent authorities and with all authorities concerned , in order to provide them with complete and correct information, in particular with regard to the information identified in the screening process .  The project promoter shall ensure that the application file is complete and adequate, seeking the national competent authority’s opinion it as early as possible in the permit-granting process.  The project promoter shall cooperate fully with the national competent authority in order to comply with the time limits set in this Regulation. Any delays due to the fault of the project promoter in good faith in this respect, shall not count against the maximum permitting duration.  11. Member States shall ensure that any amendments to the national law do not lead to prolonging any permit - granting process started before the entry into force of those amendments. With a view of maintaining an accelerated permit - granting process for projects on the Union list, national competent authorities shall adequately adapt the schedule established in accordance with paragraph 6, point (b), of this Article to ensure, to the extent possible, that the time limits for the permit - granting process set in this Article are not exceeded.  12. The time limits set in this Article shall be without prejudice to obligations arising from Union and international law, and without prejudice to administrative appeal procedures and judicial remedies before a court or tribunal.  The time limits set in this Article for any of the permit-granting procedures shall be without prejudice to any shorter time limits set by Member States.  CHAPTER IV  Cross-sectoral infrastructure planning  Article 11  Central scenario for the ten-year network development plans  1. By [two years after entry into force] and at least every four years thereafter, the Commission shall develop a central scenario for the electricity, hydrogen and gas sectors to be used for the Union-wide ten-year network development plans referred to in : Article 48 of Regulation (EU) 2019/943 and Article 59 of Regulation (EU) 2024/1789 , the infrastructure needs identification process referred to in Article 12 of this Regulation , the energy system wide cost-benefit analysis referred to in Article 14 of this Regulation , and the cross-border cost allocation referred to in Article 17 of this Regulation .  2.

The methodologies shall be developed in a transparent manner, including extensive consultation of the Agency , the Member States and all relevant stakeholders.  15. Starting from [April 2028] and e very two years, the Agency shall establish and publish a set of indicators and corresponding reference values for the comparison of unit investment costs for comparable projects of the energy infrastructure categories included in Annex II. Project promoters shall provide the requested data to the national regulatory authorities and to the Agency. Those reference values may be used by the ENTSO for Electricity and the ENNOH for the cost-benefit analyses carried out for subsequent Union-wide ten-year network development plans.  CHAPTER V  Offshore grids for renewable integration  Article 15  Offshore grid planning  1. By [ within 6 months after entry into force ], Member States, with the support of the Commission, within their specific priority offshore grid corridors, set out in Section 2 of Annex I, taking into account the specificities and development in each region, shall update the non-binding agreement to cooperate on goals for offshore renewable generation to be deployed within each sea basin by 2030, 2040 and 2050 , in accordance with their national energy and climate plans, and the offshore renewable potential of each sea basin. The agreement shall include renewable offshore hydrogen goals as applicable.  As part of the non-binding agreements, Member States, with the support of the Commission, within their specific priority offshore grid corridors, set out in Section 2 of Annex I, shall also consider whether specific cross-border goals, such as for hybrid or cross-border radial projects, should be established between two or more Member States in their respective national energy and climate plans with the aim to achieve the goals for offshore renewable generation to be deployed within each sea basin in the most efficient manner.  That non-binding agreement shall be made in writing as regards each sea basin linked to the territory of the Member States, and shall be without prejudice to the right of Member States to develop projects on their territorial sea and exclusive economic zone. The Commission shall provide guidance for the work in the Groups.  2. By [ within 12 months after entry into force ], and every four years thereafter, as part of the following ten-year network development plan thereafter, the ENTSO for Electricity, with the involvement of the relevant TSOs, the national regulatory authorities, the Member States and the Commission, and in accordance with the non-binding agreement referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, shall develop and publish, as a separate report which is part of the Union-wide ten-year network development plan, high-level strategic integrated offshore network development plans for each sea-basin, in line with the priority offshore grid corridors referred to in Annex I, taking into account environmental protection and other uses of the sea.  In the development of the high-level strategic integrated offshore network development plans within the timeline provided for in paragraph 1, the ENTSO for Electricity shall consider the non-binding agreements referred to in paragraph 1 for the development of the Union-wide ten-year network development plan central scenario.  The high-level strategic integrated offshore network development plans shall provide a general overview of offshore generation capacities potential and resulting offshore grid needs, including the potential needs for interconnectors, hybrid projects, radial connections, reinforcements, and hydrogen infrastructure.  3. The high-level strategic integrated offshore network development plans shall be consistent with regional investment plans published pursuant to Article 34(1) of Regulation (EU) 2019/943 and integrated within the Union-wide ten-year network development plans in order to ensure coherent development of onshore and offshore grid planning and the necessary reinforcements.  4. At the latest every four years after the adoption of the non-binding agreement with paragraph 1, the Member States, shall update their non-binding agreements referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, including in view of the results of the application of the latest cost-benefit and cost-sharing to the priority offshore grid corridors .  5. After each update of the non-binding agreements in accordance with paragraph 4, for each sea basin, the ENTSO for Electricity shall update the high level strategic integrated offshore network development plans within the next Union-wide ten-year network development plan as referred to in paragraph 2.  Article 16  Guidance on collaborative investment frameworks for offshore energy projects  1. T he Commission shall, with the involvement of the Member States, relevant TSOs, the Agency and the national regulatory authorities, consider whether an update of the guidance on collaborative investment frameworks for offshore energy projects, which provides for a specific cost-benefit and cost-sharing for the deployment of the sea-basin integrated offshore network development plans referred to in Article 15(2) in accordance with the non-binding agreements referred to in Article 14(1) , is necessary and, where relevant, publish an updated version of the guidance. This guidance shall be compatible with Article 17(1). The Commission shall update its guidance when appropriate, taking into account the results of its implementation.  2. The ENTSO for Electricity, with the involvement of the relevant TSOs, the Agency, the national regulatory authorities and the Commission, shall update the results of the application of the cost-benefit and cost-sharing to the priority offshore grid corridors, including whenever the Commission publishes any update to the guidance for a specific cost-benefit and cost-sharing for the deployment of the sea-basin integrated offshore network development plans referred to in Article 15(2) in accordance with the non-binding agreements referred to in Article 15(1).  CHAPTER VI  Regulatory framework  Article 17  Enabling investments with a cross-border impact  1. The efficiently incurred investment costs, which exclude maintenance costs, related to a project of common interest falling under the energy infrastructure categories set out in point s (1)(a), (b), (c), (d), (e) , (f) and (h) of Annex II, and projects of common interest falling under the energy infrastructure category set out in point (2) of Annex II, where they fall under the competence of national regulatory authorities in each Member State concerned, shall be borne by the relevant TSO, HNO, other operators or the project promoters of the transmission infrastructure of the Member States to which the project provides a net positive impact, and, to the extent not covered by congestion rents or other charges, be paid for by network users through tariffs for network access in that or those Member States.  2. The provisions of this Article shall apply to a project of common interest falling under the energy infrastructure categories set out in Article 2 7 and point s (1)(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) and (h) and point (2) of Annex II, where at least one project promoter requests the relevant national authorities their application for the costs of the project.  Projects falling under the energy infrastructure category set out in point (1)(g) of Annex II may benefit from the provisions of this Article where at least one project promoter requests its application from the relevant national authorities.  Where a project has several project promoters, the relevant national regulatory authorities shall without delay request all project promoters to submit the investment request jointly in accordance with paragraph 4.  3. For a project of common interest to which paragraph 1 applies, the project promoters shall keep all relevant national regulatory authorities regularly informed, at least once per year from inclusion of the project on the Union list , and until the project is commissioned, of the progress of that project and the identification of costs and the impact associated with it.  4. As soon as such a project of common interest has reached sufficient maturity , and is estimated to be ready to start the construction phase within the next 36 months, the project promoters, after having consulted the TSOs from the Member States which receive a significant net positive impact from it, shall submit an investment request. That investment request shall include a request for a cross-border cost allocation and shall be submitted to all the relevant national regulatory authorities concerned, accompanied by the following:  (a) up-to-date project-specific cost-benefit analysis consistent with the central scenario referred to in Article 11 and any sensitivit i es referred to in Article 11, and the methodology for a harmonised energy system-wide cost-benefit analysis referred to in Article 14 and taking into account benefits beyond the borders of the Member States on the territory of which the project is located ;  (b) a business plan evaluating the financial viability of the project, including the chosen financing solution, and, for a project of common interest falling under the energy infrastructure category referred to in point (3) of Annex II, the results of market testing;  (c) where the project promoters agree, a substantiated proposal for a cross-border cost allocation.  Where a project is promoted by several project promoters, they shall submit their investment request jointly.  The relevant national regulatory authorities shall, upon receipt, transmit to the Agency, without delay, a copy of each investment request, for information purposes.  The relevant national regulatory authorities and the Agency shall preserve the confidentiality of commercially sensitive information.  5. Within six months of the date on which the investment request is received by the last of the relevant national regulatory authorities, those authorities shall, after consulting the project promoters concerned, take joint coordinated decisions on the allocation of efficiently incurred investment costs to be borne by each system operator for the project, as well as their inclusion in tariffs, or on the rejection of the investment request, in whole or in part, if the common analysis of the relevant national regulatory authorities concludes that the project or a part of it fails to provide a significant net benefit in any of the Member States of the relevant national regulatory authorities.  The relevant national regulatory authorities shall include the relevant efficiently incurred investment costs in tariffs, as defined in the recommendation referred to in paragraph 14, in accordance with the allocation of investment costs to be borne by each system operator for the project.  For projects in the territories of their respective Member State, the relevant national regulatory authorities shall thereafter assess, where appropriate, whether any affordability issues might arise due to the inclusion of the investment costs in tariffs.  6. In allocating the costs, the relevant national regulatory authorities shall take into account the following :  (a) actual or estimated congestion rents or other charges;  (b) actual or estimated revenues stemming from the inter-transmission system operator compensation mechanism established under Article 49 of Regulation (EU) 2019/943.  The allocation of costs across borders shall take into account, the economic, social and environmental costs and benefits of the projects in the Member States concerned and the need to ensure a stable financing framework for the development of projects of common interest while minimising the need for financial support. In allocating costs across borders, the relevant national regulatory authorities, after consulting the TSOs concerned, shall seek a mutual agreement based on, but not limited to, the information specified in paragraph 4, first subparagraph, points (a) and (b), of this Article. Their assessment shall be based on the central scenario and any sensitivities referred to in Article 11, allowing a robust analysis of the contribution of the project of common interest to the Union energy policy of decarbonisation, market integration, competition, sustainability and security of supply.  7. In allocating the costs, t he relevant national regulatory authorities shall apply the following general principles:  (a) w here at least 10 % of the estimated benefits of a project occur in a Member State, that Member State and the relevant national regulatory authority shall take part in the cross-border cost - allocation process ;  (b) w here appropriate, the allocation of costs among the Member States shall be based on the distribution of net benefits, ensuring that the cost-allocation key reflects that distribution ;  (c) t he cross-border cost allocation shall be based on an ex-ante cost-allocation agreement designed to ensure investment certainty , whereas t he agreement shall be transparent and predictable and t he cross-border cost-allocation may provide for the possibility of ex-post adjustments, provided that such adjustments are explicitly defined in the cost allocation decision and clearly framed, including as regards timeframes and categories of costs covered.  Where a project of common interest mitigates negative externalities, such as loop flows, and that project of common interest is implemented in the Member State at the origin of the negative externality, such mitigation shall not be regarded as a cross-border benefit and shall therefore not constitute a basis for allocating costs to the TSO of the Member States affected by those negative externalities.  8. The relevant national regulatory authorities shall, on the basis of the cross-border cost allocation referred to in paragraph 5 of this Article, take into account actual costs incurred by a TSO, HNO or other project promoter as a result of the investments when fixing or approving tariffs in accordance with Article 78(1) of Directive (EU) 2024 / 1788 and Article 59(1), point (a), of Directive (EU) 2019/944, insofar as those costs correspond to those of an efficient and structurally comparable operator.  9. The relevant national regulatory authorities shall notify the cost allocation decision to the Agency, without delay, together with all the relevant information with respect to that decision. In particular, the cost allocation decision shall set out detailed reasons for the allocation of costs among Member States, including the following:  (a) an evaluation of the identified impact on each of the concerned Member States, including those concerning network tariffs;  (b) an evaluation of the business plan referred to in paragraph 4, first subparagraph, point (b);  (c) regional or Union-wide positive externalities, such as security of supply, system flexibility, solidarity or innovation, which the project would generate;  (d) the result of the consultation of the project promoters concerned.  The cost allocation decision shall be published on the websites of the relevant national regulatory authorities and shared with Agency and the Commission.  By [ within 6 months of entry into force ], the Agency shall establish a central repository of all cross-border cost-allocation decisions taken by national regulatory authorities and host it on its website.  10. Where the relevant national regulatory authorities have not reached an agreement on the investment request within six months of the date on which the request was received by the last of the relevant national regulatory authorities, they shall inform the Agency without delay.  In that case, or upon a joint request from the relevant national regulatory authorities, the decision on the investment request including cross-border cost allocation referred to in paragraph 5 shall be taken by the Agency within three months of the date of referral to the Agency.  Before taking such a decision, the Agency shall consult the relevant national regulatory authorities and the project promoters. The three-month period referred to in the second subparagraph may be extended by an additional period of two months where further information is sought by the Agency. That additional period shall begin on the day following receipt of the complete information.  The assessment of the Agency shall be based on the central scenario established under Article 11 and any sensitivities, allowing a robust analysis of the contribution of the project of common interest to the Union energy policy targets of decarbonisation, market integration, competition, sustainability and security of supply.  The Agency, in its decision on the investment request including cross-border cost allocation, shall leave the determination of the way the investment costs are included in the tariffs in accordance with the cross-border cost allocation prescribed, to the relevant national authorities at the time of the implementation of that decision in accordance with national law.  The decision on the investment request including cross-border cost allocation shall be published. Article 25(3) and Articles 28 and 29 of Regulation (EU) 2019/942 shall apply.  11. A copy of all cost allocation decisions, together with all the relevant information with respect to each decision, shall be notified, without delay, by the Agency to the Commission. The Agency shall publish non-confidential versions of all decisions on its website. That information may be submitted in aggregate form. The Agency and the Commission shall preserve the confidentiality of commercially sensitive information.  12. Cost allocation decisions shall not affect the right of TSOs to apply and of national regulatory authorities to approve charges for access to networks in accordance with Regulation s (EU) 2019/943 and (E U ) 2024/1789 and Directive s (EU) 2019/944 and (EU) 2024/ 1 788 .  13. This Article shall not apply to projects of common interest which benefit from one or more of the following :  (a) a n exemption from Articles 31, 32, 33 and Article s 78(7) and Directive (EU) 2024/1788 , pursuant to Article 78 of Regulation (EU) 2024/1789 ;  (b) a n exemption from Article 19(2) and (3) of Regulation (EU) 2019/943 or Article 6, Article 59(7) and Article 60(1) of Directive (EU) 2019/944, pursuant to Article 63 of Regulation (EU) 2019/943;  (c) a derogation from unbundling or third - party access rules, pursuant to Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 714/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council 67 or to Article 64 of Regulation (EU) 2019/943 and Article 66 of Directive (EU) 2019/944.  14. By [ six months after entry into force of this Regulation ], the Agency shall adopt a recommendation for identifying good practices for the treatment of investment requests for projects of common interest in accordance with the principles referred to in paragraph 7 of this A rticle.  That recommendation shall be regularly updated by the Agency as necessary. It shall take account of sectorial specificities, and shall ensure consistency with the principles on the offshore grids for renewable energy cross-border cost sharing as referred to in Article 16(1). In adopting or updating the recommendation, the Agency shall carry out an extensive consultation process, involving all relevant stakeholders. That recommendation shall also include a non-binding cross-border cost-allocation template to facilitate the work of national regulatory agencies.  15. Projects of mutual interest shall obtain a cross-border cost allocation under the same rules and conditions referred to in this Article as regards the benefits they bring for the Union . It shall be issued in a coordinated manner by the relevant national regulatory authoriti es of the benefiting Member States.  16. This Article shall apply mutatis mutandis to project bundles under Article 18.  Article 18  Enabling energy infrastructure projects bundling for the purpose of cost-sharing  1. Project promoters may bundle two or more projects on the Union list to facilitate the discussions on cost - sharing between the relevant Member States and third countries, as appropriate, and the cross-border cost-allocation decisions between the concerned competent authorities of the Member States or between the competent authorities of the Member States and third countries, as appropriate.  2. The Commission may invite p roject promoters to submit a proposal for one or several bundles of two or more projects on the Union list to the relevant G roups for discussion. A project bundle may include projects at different stages of maturity, provided that the ir bundling does not delay the implementation of the most mature projects.  3. Following the discussions in the G roups, the Commission may request the ENTSO for E lectricity or the ENNOH to provide a common cost-benefit analysis for the proposed bundles of two or more projects on the Union list . The common cost-benefit analysis shall be consistent with the central scenario and sensitiviti e s referred to under Article 11, and the methodology drawn up pursuant to Article 15. The ENTSO for E lectricity or the ENNOH shall provide the common cost-benefit analysis within 2 months of the request to the Commission.  4. The relevant Member States, with the involvement of the relevant national regulatory authorities , and with the support of the Commission, shall conclude on the bundle of projects and, where appropriate, invite project promoters to add projects to the bundle or delete projects from the bundle, if this facilitates discussions on cost-sharing, provided that the number of projects on the Union list included in the bundle remains manageable.  5. The relevant Member States may decide to endorse the bundles and invite project promoters to submit a joint investment request under Article 17(4). Th at decision shall be shared with the relevant G roups and the Commission. For the purpose of Article 17(4), only one up-to-date cost-benefit analysis and one proposal for a cross-border cost-allocation shall be included in the investment request in view of facilitating a possible application for Union financial assistance pursuant to Article 2 1 .  Article 19  Ring-fenced congestion income for projects on the Union list  1. TSOs shall set aside 25 % of the congestion rents not spent for guaranteeing the actual availability of the allocated capacity pursuant to Article 19(2) , point (a) , of Regulation ( EU) 2019/943 and for compensation to offshore renewable electricity generation plant operators pursuant to Article 19(2) , point (c) , of Regulation (EU) 2019/943 , for network investments into projects on the Union list relevant to reducing interconnector congestion pursuant Article 19(2) , point (b) , of Regulation (EU) 2019/943 .  2. TSOs shall place the funds referred to in point 1 of this Article on a separate account line until it can be spent for financing projects on the Union list relevant to reducing interconnector congestion, or until they have demonstrated that the priority objectives set out in Article 19(2) , point (b) , of Regulation (EU) 2019/ 9 43 have been adequately fulfilled and there is no need for additional cross-border capacity to be built at the borders of the Member State s concerned to reduce interconnector congestion .  3. The use of the funds ref erred to in paragraph 1 shall :  (a) address the financing gap of projects on the Union list which have significant benefits outside their hosting countries, taking due account of expected tariff financing ;  (b) be made transparent in requests for cross-border cost allocation decisions pursuant to Article 17 of this Regulation;  (c) avoid double funding and ensure proportionality, transparency and non-discrimination ;  (d) not compromise the fulfilment of the priority objectives under Article 19(2) of Regulation (EU) 2019/943.  4. The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 2 3 of this Regulation to supplement this Regulation by specifying the conditions under which TSOs may use the funds referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article and the conditions under which the objective of Article 19(2) , point (b) , of Regulation ( EU) 2019/ 943 is considered adequately fulfilled .  5. Within [ 6 months ] after the entry into force of the dele gated acts referred in paragraph 4 , the Agency shall update the methodology on the use of revenues from congestion income pursuant to Article 19(4) of Regulation (EU) 2019/943 . The updated methodology shall be consistent with paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this Article and with the delegated act s adopted pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Article .  Article 20  Regulatory incentives  1. Where a project promoter incurs higher risks for the development, construction, operation or maintenance of a project of common interest falling under the competence of national regulatory authorities, when compared to the risks normally incurred by a comparable infrastructure project, national regulatory authorities may grant appropriate incentives to that project in accordance with Regulation s (E U ) 2019/943 and 2024/1789 and Directive s (EU) 2019/944 and (EU) 2024/1788 .  The first subparagraph shall not apply where the project of common interest benefits from one or more of the following:  (a) a n exemption from Articles 31, 32, and 33, and Article s 78(7) and (9) of Directive (EU) 2024/1788 , pursuant to Article 78 of Re gulation (EU) 2024//1789 ;  (b) a n exemption from Article 19(2) and (3) of Regulation (EU) 2019/943 or from Article 6, Article 59(7) and Article 60(1) of Directive (EU) 2019/944 pursuant to Article 63 of Regulation (EU) 2019/943;  (c) a n exemption pursuant to Article 36 of Directive 2009/73/EC;  (d) a derogation pursuant to Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 714/2009.  2. In the case of a decision to grant the incentives referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, national regulatory authorities shall consider the results of the cost-benefit analysis consistent with the methodology drawn up pursuant to Article 1 4 and in particular the regional or Union-wide positive externalities generated by the project. The national regulatory authorities shall further analyse the specific risks incurred by the project promoters, the risk mitigation measures taken and the reasons for the risk profile in view of the net positive impact provided by the project, when compared to a lower-risk alternative. Eligible risks shall in particular include risks related to new transmission technologies, both onshore and offshore, risks related to under-recovery of costs and development risks.  3. The decision to grant the incentives shall take into account the specific nature of the risk incurred and may grant incentives covering, inter alia, one or more of the following measures:  (a) the rules for anticipatory investment;  (b) the rules for recognition of efficiently incurred costs before commissioning of the project;  (c) the rules for providing additional return on the capital invested for the project;  (d) any other measure deemed necessary and appropriate.

Title of the proposal/initiative  Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on guidelines for trans-European energy infrastructure amending Regulations (EU) 2019/942, and (EU) 2019/943 and (EU) 2024/1789 and repealing Regulation (EU) 2022/869.  1.2. Policy area(s) concerned  Area: Energy  Activity: Clean Industrial Deal  1.3. Objective(s)  1.3.1. General objective(s)  The general objective is the timely an efficient development and interoperability of resilient energy infrastructure, renewable energy and flexibility, including storage and recharging stations, across the EU. This will enable the EU to deliver on its energy and climate objectives, including ensuring energy affordability through better interconnectivity, leading to price convergence, reduced wholesale electricity prices and lower volatility of electricity prices as well as to accelerated connection of generation and demand.  1.3.2. Specific objective(s)  To achieve the general objective, four specific objectives (SOs) are addressed by this initiative:  i)  SO1: Ensure that projects included in network development plans and selected as PCI/PMIs address appropriately and effectively identified infrastructure needs ensuring timely and efficient development of energy infrastructure;  ii) SO2: Facilitate the use of cost-sharing tools for faster deployment of cross-border infrastructure projects, leading to an increased use of cost-sharing tools and a reduction in project deployment time;  iii) SO3: Shorten and simplify permitting procedures for energy infrastructure, renewable energy and storage projects, as well as recharging stations, leading to shorter time to obtain necessary permits, making it feasible to meet the existing deadlines, and simplified permit requirements;  iv)  SO4: Enhance physical and cyber security and resilience of cross-border energy infrastructure (PCIs/PMIs) by increasing the number of protection and resilience equipment and installations on critical network elements.  The proposal entails a new requirement for the Commission, which is linked to the achievement of SO1:  – Requirement 1 (linked to SO1): The Commission is tasked with the development of a comprehensive central scenario and sensitivity analyses, as necessary, at least every four years for the electricity, hydrogen and gas sectors to be used for the Union-wide ten year network development plans (TYNDP) (Article 11).  The proposal entails new requirements for ACER, which are linked to the achievement of SO1 and SO2:  – Requirement 2 (linked to SO1): For the purpose of the central scenario development, ACER is tasked with supporting as well as verifying the data collection by the Commission (Article 11). In addition, ACER is required to develop and publish a binding framework methodology for the identification of infrastructure needs (to be conducted by ENTSO-E and ENNOH).  – Requirement 3 (linked to SO2): ACER is mandated to update its Cross-Border Cost Allocation (CBCA) recommendation and establish a central repository of all CBCA decisions (Article 17).  1.3.3. Expected result(s) and impact  Specify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries / groups targeted.  The additional resources will allow the Commission and ACER to carry out the tasks necessary to fulfil their mandate under EU legislation as per the requirements under this proposal. The proposal is expected to have the following effects on the beneficiaries and groups targeted:  – Requirement 1: Tasking the Commission with central scenario development is expected to ensure greater transparency, scrutiny and coherence of inputs used in network planning both at European and national level, with the ultimate aim to ensure infrastructure needs are identified and addressed more effectively, leading to a reduction in the gap between planned infrastructure projects in the TYNDP and the identified cross-border infrastructure needs over time, to the benefit of all system and network operators and users by progressing faster towards an optimal grid.  – Requirement 2: Entrusting ACER with tasks related to the central scenario development and infrastructure needs identification will ensure the process and its outcomes are robust and credible, with similar benefits as Requirement 1.  – Requirement 3: Tasking ACER with updating its Cross-Border Cost Allocation Recommendation will create a more harmonised cost-sharing framework improving consistency across Member States and CBCA decisions and encourage greater involvement of non-hosting Member States, with the aim to facilitate the use of cost-sharing tools for faster deployment of cross-border infrastructure projects.  1.3.4. Indicators of performance  Specify the indicators for monitoring progress and achievements.  The indicators for monitoring progress and achievement of the initiative’s objectives are listed in Annex 8 of the Impact Assessment accompanying the Grids Package. They include in particular:  – the extent to which projects included in network developments and selected as PCIs/PMIs address appropriately and effectively identified infrastructure needs;  – the effective and increased use of cost-sharing tools;  – the simplification of permitting procedures, shortening of permitting lead times and meeting current deadlines;  – the enhanced physical and cyber security and resilience of energy infrastructure.  As regards the specific objectives which Requirements 1-3 are linked with, the following indicators apply:  – Indicators for Requirement 1 & 2 (linked to SO1): The number and total capacity of new cross-border interconnectors approved/implemented; the extent to which identified infrastructure needs are addressed by infrastructure projects (capacity) included in the TYNDP (planned, under construction or commissioned) or other non-wire solutions (presence of the gap between needs and projects, and decrease of the gap); the uptake of non-wire solutions in terms of number of projects and respective increase in grid capacity.  – Indicators for Requirement 3 (linked to SO2): The number of binding cost-sharing agreements enabling the implementation cross-border projects; the average duration for reaching a cost-allocation agreement; the number of non-hosting countries contributing to cost-sharing agreements; the number of projects being as part of bundles being submitted for PCI/PMI status  1.4. The proposal/initiative relates to:   a new action   a new action following a pilot project / preparatory action 70  X the extension of an existing action   a merger or redirection of one or more actions towards another/a new action  1.5. Grounds for the proposal/initiative  1.5.1. Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative  Requirement 1:  A new provision is introduced requiring the Commission to develop a central scenario to be used for the Union-wide TYNDP after entry into force of the Regulation and at least every four years thereafter (Article 11). The Commission must also develop a methodology for the collection of data from the ENTSO-E, ENNOH and ENTSO-G and consult the relevant actors on the data collected. The Commission must also consult the draft central scenario with the TEN-E Group and adopt and publish the final central scenario. The Commission may also develop sensitivity analyses to the central scenario if necessary based on market of policy developments. The Commission will have to follow up on the identified needs in the relevant regional fora. Within the Commission, these tasks would be attributed to DG Energy and the JRC.  As regards DG Energy, the new requirement related to the central scenario development, would necessitate additional resources to manage the scenario development process which implies a large number of interactions with stakeholders, Member States, supporting services and partners etc. On the basis of the impact assessment accompanying this proposal, the execution of these tasks will result in an additional workload for DG Energy totalling 6 FTEs. These additional resources would cover the following needs:  Process steering:  – Coordinate the overall process between ENTSO/TSOs, the Commission and ACER as required by the TEN-E legislation; Consult with stakeholders and Member States during the different phases of the process (including hrough workshopes and meeetings) and appropriate follow-up (as described in Articles 11 to 13).  – Ensure the compatibility of grid scenarios within the overall policy architecture; Align the scenario design with ongoing policy scenario (e.g. related to 2040 targets, RED, EE, ETS, etc); Ensure alignment with NECPs and ERAA; Manage the assessment process of the draft and final infrastructure needs identification report (carried out by the ENTSOs).  – Coordinate the needs matching process (following the adoption of the infrastructure needs assessment) with ENTSO-E, TSOs, Member States, national regulatory authorities and relevant stakeholders and steer the process with the relevant regional groups. Closely follow the energy system wide cost-benefit analysis with ENTSOs and ensure propoer implementation including the inclusions of relevant stakeholders.  – Prepare and draft legal acts and manage the adoption process.  Scenario development and coordination:  – Ensure data collection with Member States, ENTSO-E, ENTSO-G, ENNOH, NRAs, and other stakeholders. Maintain repositories and ensure data quality process.  – Coordination of the assessment work. This will include all steps of the modelling process, i.e. ensuring data availability, setting critical assumptions, reviewing and quality controlling draft modelling results, following up on work plan and planning the interaction of modellers/analysts with relevant stakeholders.  – Document the different steps of the modelling exercise and disseminate the reports and data sets. The documentation will include methodology, data, key assumptions, results in different formats: reports, data files, online resources.  As regards the JRC , they would be tasked with supporting DG Energy in the central scenario development as well as executing the modelling. Data collection from Member States and TSOs for electricity, gas and hydrogen modelling will be the responsibility of DG ENER with support from the JRC. On the basis of the impact assessment this is expected to result in new workload for JRC totalling 12 FTEs.  – Working with DG Energy and providing technical and policy expertise in developing the methodology for the central scenario modelling as well as supporting DG Energy with the necessary data collection from the ENTSO-E, ENNOH and ENTSO-G.  – Energy system modelling: Construct scenarios and sensitivities; Data management required for the energy system modelling;  – Electricity modelling: Electricity dispatch modelling of the scenarios; Power flow calculations; Data management required for the electricity modelling  – Gas and hydrogen modelling: Updating the long-term expectations for gas and hydrogen; Gas market and network modelling of the scenarios; Modelling of gas/hydrogen flows; Data modelling included for gas/hydrogen modelling; Data management required for gas and hydrogen modelling.  Overall, it is estimated that the proposal will result in new workload for the Commission totalling 18 FTEs for (6 FTEs for DG Energy and 12 FTEs for JRC, of which 4 redeployed from its current resources and 9 financed via an administrative agreementI). In addition, EUR 1 million in one-off operational costs and 500,000 in recurrent, annual operational costs would be required for technical updates, extensions and maintenance of the electricity, gas and hydrogen models, for modelling of targets, NECPs and energy mixes, as well as organisation of workshops and missions.  ACER  Requirement 2:  ACER is tasked with supporting as well as verifying the all input data collected by the Commission as part of the central scenario development (Article 11). In addition, ACER is required to develop a binding methodology for the identification of infrastructure needs (Article 12) and assess the compliance of the draft infrastructure needs identification developed and submitted by ENTSO-E and ENNOH, with the developed framework methodology and report to the TEN-E Group. ACER is also required to update the framework methodology when necessary on its own initiative or upon the request of the Commission  The execution of these new tasks is estimated to result in an additional workload for ACER totalling 2 FTE. In addition, ACER would have operational expenditures including consultancy support for the development of the infrastructure needs methodology, the development of an IT tool to facilitate data verification and overheads, with estimated one-off cost of EUR 130 000 as well as recurrent operational costs of EUR 100 000 per year.  Requirement 3:  ACER is required to adopt a Cross-Border Cost Allocation Recommendation, identifying good practices for the treatment of investment requests for PCIs, taking into account the principles in the TEN-E Regulation (Article 17). That recommendation shall be regularly updated as necessary. In adopting or amending the recommendation, ACER shall carry out an extensive consultation process, involving all relevant stakeholders. That recommendation shall also include a non-binding cross-border cost-allocation template to facilitate the work of national regulatory agencies.  The development and adoption of a Cross-Border Cost Allocation Recommendation a\s well as the maintenance of a repository of CBCA Decisions is estimated to result in an additional workload for ACER totalling 1 FTE as well as an estimated one-off cost of EUR 70 000 for the development of the IT tool for the repository of CBCA decisions.  For DG Energy and, JRC and ACER, the requirements above to implementation of the legislative proposal extend beyond the current 2021-2027 MFF.  1.5.2. Added value of EU involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, great er effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this section 'added value of EU involvement' is the value resulting from EU action that is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.  Please see Explanatory Memorandum sections on subsidiarity and proportionality.  1.5.3. Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past  The evaluation of the previous TEN-E Regulation showed that it effectively improved integration of Member States’ networks, stimulated energy trade and hence contributed to Union competitiveness. PCIs have also strongly contributed to security of supply as a main contextual driver to the design of the TEN-E Regulation. Following its evaluation in 2020, the TEN-E Regulation was revised in 2022. The Implementation Report annexed to the Impact Assessment analyses lessons learned from the implementation of the revised TEN-E Regulation. The Implementation Report provides evidence of the need for further improvements, namely when it comes to scenario development, infrastructure needs identification and consequent TYNDP, PCI/PMI project selection and assessment, as well as CBCA and permitting frameworks.  1.5.4. Compatibility with the multiannual financial framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments  This Grids Package is a key deliverable under the Clean Industrial Deal and the Action Plan for Affordable Energy, which are part of the 2025 Commission Work Program. The proposal is complementary to other initiatives that aim to create a more integrated European energy market and lower energy costs for households and industries. Energy infrastructure is also crucial to achieve the proposed 2040 EU climate target, and to the EU’s objective of achieving climate neutrality by 2050.  The Commission proposal for the new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) 2028-2034 highlights “the vital importance of a genuine Energy Union and well-integrated EU infrastructure networks”, which is reflected in a substantially increased budget proposed for the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) for Energy. The TEN-E Regulation provides the basis for energy infrastructure projects funded under CEF.  1.5.5. Assessment of the different available financing options, including scope for redeployment  The Impact Assessment report acompanying this proposal analysed different policy options to achieve the initiative’s general and specific objectives. The preferred policy option which is pursued through this legislative proposal, was considered the most effective and cost-efficient approach and in line with the subsidiarity and proportionality principles.  DG Energy, JRC and ACER are considered best placed to execute the additional requirements stemming from the legislative proposal due to their previous experiences with the infrastructure planning process and energy system modelling.  DG Energy has developed significant experience in the infrastructure planning and coordination process since the TEN-E Regulation was first adopted in 2013. It is therefore best suited to coordinate the infrastructure needs identification and gap filling mechanisms at EU-level in an impartiall manner. The JRC has significant technical knowledge in energy system modelling and has developed its own modelling tools. It is therefore considered best placed to conduct the modelling tasks linked to the central scenario development.  Due to its mandate, ACER is best placed to implement requirements 1 & 2. It has developed substantial technical expertise as a key actor with a formal role in both the infrastructure planning process and the cross-border cost allocation framework at EU-level under the current TEN-E framework  The additional FTEs are needed for new tasks/requirements ensuing from this legisltive proposal, while existing tasks will not decrease in the foreseeable future.  1.6.

Comments  N.A.  2. MANAGEMENT MEASURES  2.1. Monitoring and reporting rules  DG Energy and the JRC  The tasks directly implemented by DG Energy will follow the annual cycle of planning and monitoring, as implemented in the Commission and the executive agencies, including reporting the results through the Annual Activity Report of DG ENER and the Annual Activity Report of the JRC.  ACER  According to its financial regulation, ACER has to provide, in the context of its Programming Document, an annual Work Programme including details on resources, both financial and human, per each of the activities carried out.  ACER reports monthly to DG Energy on budget execution, including commitments, and payments by budget title, and vacancy rates by type of staff.  In addition, DG Energy is directly represented in the governance bodies of ACER. Through its representatives in the Administrative Board, DG Energy will be informed of the use of the budget and the establishment plan at each of its meetings during the year.  Finally, also in line with financial rules, ACER is subject to annual requirements for reporting on activities and the use of resources through the Administrative Board and its Annual Activity Report.  2.2. Management and control system(s)  2.2.1. Justification of the budget implementation method(s), the funding implementation mechanism(s), the payment modalities and the control strategy proposed  Requirement 1:  The tasks under Requirement will be assigned to the Commission.  Subject to decision taken during the implementation, these tasks may be carried out internally or outsourced to a service provider, via a public procurement procedure. In the case the tasks are procured from a service provider, the procurement will be implemented under direct management, in full application of the provisions of the Financial Regulation. The control strategy for procurements in DG Energy and the JRC includes specific ex-ante legal, operational and financial controls on the procurement procedure (review by the advisory committee for procurement and contracts) as well as on the signature of contracts. In addition, expenditure made to procure goods and services is subject to ex ante and, when necessary, ex-post and financial controls.  Requirements 2 & 3:  Due to its mandate, ACER is best placed to establish expertise related to the implementation of requirements 4 and 3.  DG Energy established a control strategy for managing its relations with ACER, part of the 2017 Internal Control Framework of the Commission. The Agency revised and adopted its own Internal Control Framework in December 2018.  2.2.2. Information concerning the risks identified and the internal control system(s) set up to mitigate them  DG Energy  The elements directly managed by DG Energy may be subject to the usual risks affecting public procurement procedures. These risks are considered low level as regards legality and regularity of the expenditure. Appropriate and effective controls are in place at corporate and DG level.  Concerning performance, the main risk are wrong estimates as regards the workload created by this proposal, given that it introduces new tasks. This risk needs to be accepted, since, as experience has shown, if additional resources needs are not included in the initial proposal, it is very difficult to remedy this situation later on.  DG JRC  As part of the risk assessment process for its scientific activities, the JRC identifies potential risks, evaluates their level and plans necessary mitigating actions and identifies existing controls. The key risk identified refers to a) the estimation of the related workload for the new tasks associated to this proposal (the workload for some of the tasks might be underestimated); b) insufficient quantity or quality of the data to support the various new tasks. For a) the risk needs to be accepted; mitigation measures include careful staff planning throughout the duration of the activities to ensure appropriate expertise. For b) the actions include an early participation in designing and framing the data collection processes, as well as early identification, within each task requiring data intense activities, of the potential barriers to get access to the data of interest and early communication with DG ENER and relevant stakeholders to raise the issue of data availability.  ACER  As regards new tasks for ACER, the proposal includes several new tasks which mitigates this risk, since while the workload of some future tasks may be underestimated, others may be overestimated, providing scope for possible future redeployment.  2.2.3. Estimation and justification of the cost-effectiveness of the controls (ratio between the control costs  and the value of the related funds managed), and assessment of the expected levels of risk of error (at payment & at closure)  DG Energy  The tasks assigned for DG Energy will be implemented following already existing control system and the cost of control ratio is expected to remain stable (5 to 6% of the funds managed based on recent exercises).  ACER  The allocation of additional tasks for the existing mandate of ACER is not expected to generate specific additional controls at Agency level, therefore, the ratio of control costs over value of funds managed will remain unaltered for ACER.  2.3. Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities  DG Energy  DG Energy adopted a revised Anti-fraud Strategy in 2020 and, in 2023, a revised action plan covering the years 2023-2025. DG Energy is is currently revising its AFS for the years 2026-2028, in accordance with the OLAF methodology. The Energy AFS  are based on the Commission Antifraud Strategy and on a specific risk assessment carried out internally to identify the areas most vulnerable to fraud, the controls already in place and the actions necessary to improve DG Energy’s capacity to prevent, detect and correct fraud.  DG JRC  The JRC Anti-Fraud Strategy, along with its accompanying Action Plan, was adopted in 2020 and modified in 2024 to revise and update the plan for the period 2025-2027. The updated plan includes three new actions: an awareness-raising campaign focusing on Commission ethics issues and anti-fraud measures, with relevant examples tailored for JRC scientific staff, launched in the first half of 2025; an expanded training programme featuring thematic sessions on topics such as conflict of interest, authorship, the use of AI, whistleblowing and reporting channels, among others; updated Sharepoint pages dedicated to ethics issues and anti-fraud measures. These new actions complement the ongoing efforts from the 2021-2024 Action Plan and JRC participation in the Commission Antifraud Strategy Action Plan. The JRC values its cooperation with OLAF, the internal control team, and other stakeholders in our collective efforts to combat fraud.  ACER  ACER applies the anti-fraud principles of decentralised EU Agencies, in line with the Commission approach and the Guidelines by OLAF of 2024 for decentralised agencies and JUs. In December 2024 the Agency adopted a new Anti-Fraud Strategy, repealing Decision 15/2021 of the Administrative Board of the Agency. The new strategy, spanning the period 2025-2027, is based on the following strategic objectives: optimise existing fraud prevention measures, enhance timeliness and accuracy of existing detection systems, strengthen investigation protocols, and optimise corrective actions for swift recoveries.  3.

Digital dimensions  4.1. Requirements of digital relevance  Table: Row 1 — Requirements of digital relevance in the proposal: Requirement 1 (R1) relates to scenario development processes and infrastructure needs identification, which should consider the potential use of digital and smart solutions next to physical grid development already in the modelling part of the network development planning. As a related requirement, transmission system operators in electricity are required to consider with priority non-wire and digital solutions when proposing new infrastructure projects, with such requirements applicable on a European level (as part of the EU-wide ten-years network development plan) as well as on a national level (national network development plans on a transmission level). This will help ensuring  maximum efficiency in grid development and also incentivise use of digital solutions in practice. This requirement applies for EU institutions responsible for the modelling process, Member States, bodies representing transmission system operators on a European level (ENTSO for Electricity, ENTSO for Gas and ENNOH) as well as to transmission system operators on a national level. Requirement 2 (R2) relates to introduction of a new non-wire and digital transmission category for Projects of Common Interest. Such category aims to provide better incentives for use of grid enhancing and digital technologies by transmission system operators, to increase efficiency of grid utilisation and increase cross-border transmission capacity. When applying for the new category, transmission system operators are required to submit data related to technical characteristics of proposed digitalisation systems as well as expected impacts on the transmission system operation. ENTSO for Electricity, as a body proposed for calculating the costs and benefits of new projects, would be responsible for processing related data. Requirement 3 (R3) relates to the permitting application procedure for projects on the Union list of projects of common interest and of projects of mutual interest. Member States’ national competent authority must be able to receive permitting applications and all relevant documents in digital format (Article 8). Under the proposal, Member States are required to ensure a digital platform is available at national level to manage steps of the permit of the permit-granting procedure (including permitting applications, permitting processes, ongoing permitting decisions) and make available decisions issued in an easily accessible format (Article 10 (4)).  This should contribute to more uniform digitalisation and transparency across different permitting authorities in Member States and ultimately speed up permitting. This will be on top of the obligation on MS that all decisions are to be issued in an easily accessible format.  4.2. Data  Table: Row 1 — For Requirement 1: The requirement relates to existing data collection for purposes of grid modelling and scenario development and may lead to new data being collected on future use of digital technologies and their potential. While assumptions on potential of such technologies exist in literature, Member States’ data are currently not publicly available and are not collected for the same purpose (once-only principle has been duly followed). Transmission system operators will start assessing flexibility needs assessment pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2019/943 as of 2026 and some of the data being used can also be used for purposes of grid planning. However, the span of the former is only 10 years, while Union-wide grid planning covers upcoming 10-20 years. In this regard, data collection seems inevitable to ensure full coverage. Secondary legislation on concrete format of data will ensure existing collections for the purposes of Flexibility Needs Assessments are taken into account to avoid any duplication in requirements. Regarding the data flow, data are provided by transmission system operators, regulatory authorities and Member States to the Commission based on rule to be adopted via secondary legal acts. Additional data for grid modelling, if necessary, are to be provided by transmission system operators directly to the ENTSO for electricity. For Requirement 2: Data related to submission of application for the Project of Common Interest are unique for each project and hence must be collected at time of submission of the application (once-only principle hence fully complied to). Such data relate to scope of the project, financial estimates, technologies used, location, impact on environment and power grid, etc. Data will be submitted by project promoters (mostly transmission system operators) to the ENTSO for Electricity and the European Commission for the purpose of assessing costs and benefits under the evaluation processes for Projects of Common Interest. For Requirement 3: The digital platforms which Member States would be required to set up would store all data necessary for a complete permit or permits for projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest. These are personal data with connection to the applicant whether a natural or legal person, the characteristics of the project and all necessary supporting documents.  4.3. Digital solutions  Table: Row 1 — For Requirement 1: Platform related to requirement 1 relates to grid modelling and scenario modelling for future infrastructure development. ENTSO for Electricity already uses such platform, hence new requirement relates to upgrade of the platform to process more data. Regarding European Commission role in the scenario modelling process, data will be used in existing models, hence no new requirements to establish a separate platform are stipulated by changes. For Requirement 2: This requirement should not lead to establishment of new platforms of systems for processing the data, as the PCI selection process is well established and the aim is to broaden the scope of categories (while keeping the principles for the assessment, using existing systems for processing applications and calculating costs and benefits). For Requirement 3: The digitalisation and centralisation of permitting procedures will be facilitated by the digital platforms which Member States would be required to set up. By centralising this data, we expect to simplify procedures and prevent the duplication of the same data in different platforms. In the recitals, the Commission urges that the portal should present features, including by means of artificial intelligence, allowing the single contact point, other authorities and applicants to check the status of the application and where delays are, as well as check compliance with the permitting deadlines. In addition, it should allow for the extraction of statistics to check the overall progress of permitting-granting procedures in Member States. The portal should facilitate the duties of the single contact point who should have access to all relevant data and information.  4.4. Interoperability assessment  Table: Row 1 — Requirements 1 and 2 do not require interaction across Member State borders as the aim is to feed data for evaluations at the EU level, in a centralized way. They are also not related to cross-border interoperability as the data exchanged are on future estimates of project development, not on existing data flows related to operation of the system (which are already exchanged via other TSO cooperation platforms). There is an expectation that data will be shared only once, i.e. either to the ENTSO for Electricity (which will consequently share them with the Commission), or with the Commission directly (in case identical data are not needed by the ENTSO for Electricity). Information is exchanged via data files – not via mutual linking of two platforms. Requirement 3 does not require interaction across Member State borders, among EU entities or between EU entities and public sector bodies. It also does not have an effect on cross-border inter-operability as the data is of relevance for national, rather than EU-level decision-making procedures. A centrally defined data structure has been considered and discarded, since due to the mostly national character of the biggest percentage of the permitting procedures in each MS and the different permitting systems, it is logical that the actual decision on format for the implementation is left to MS, which can decide what fits best to their system and the new digital platform they will set up. While TEN-E Regulation requires national competent authorities in charge of permitting to cooperate in cross border projects to the extent possible, it gives Member States the freedom to decide on the most appropriate way to do so. Since part of the data in question may also be required and assessed for procedures related with projects not covered unde TEN-E regulation, it will also be proposed that these platforms are set up as multi-purpose platform that covers the permitting of a wide range of energy asets (grids,pipelines, renewables, storage, etc). The public services affected by these suggestions would be all national authorities involved in the permitting of energy assets, e.g. energy ministry and/or agencies, municipal/local administration and environmental authorities. Administrative bodies or entities responsible for opinion or approval on projects afecting spatiall planning and cultural heritage sites would also be affected.  4.5. Measures to support digital implementation  Table: Row 1 — Measures relate to Requirement 2, i.e. introduction of a new non-wire and digital transmission category for Projects of Common Interest. Such category aims to provide better incentives for use of grid enhancing and digital technologies by transmission system operators, to increase efficiency of grid utilisation and increase cross-border transmission capacity. Such investment, if granted a status of a Project of Common Interest, would benefit from accelerated permitting and if fulfilling all necessary conditions, may apply for a funding from Connecting Europe Facility. These measures should support implementation of digital platforms within EU transmission and distribution grids.

To this aim, the identified needs should indicate to market participants the main cross-border transmission infrastructure gaps, including internal infrastructure with significant cross-border impact, that need to be addressed over the next ten to twenty years.",,,,,,,"The European Commission's legislative proposal for ""Trans-European energy infrastructure: guidelines"" seeks to modernize and expand the EU's energy infrastructure, aligning with the bloc's renewable energy and decarbonization goals by 2040. The proposal emphasizes the development and integration of energy infrastructure through electrification and hydrogen systems, while also streamlining planning and permitting processes for cross-border energy projects to enhance network efficiency and resilience. This addresses challenges such as lengthy project completion times and permitting bottlenecks.

To ensure timely development, the proposal introduces measures to bolster both physical and cyber security, responding to recent incidents and the growing interest of third-country actors in EU energy infrastructure. Projects of common and mutual interest are selected for inclusion in the Union list through a unified process based on transparent and objective criteria aligned with EU energy policy objectives. These projects must be part of the latest Union-wide ten-year network development plan, with sustainability as a key criterion.

Specific criteria for these projects include contributions to sustainability through renewable energy integration, market integration, security of supply, network security, smart sector integration, and carbon dioxide emission reduction. For electricity transmission, distribution, and storage projects, contributions to sustainability, market integration, and security of supply are emphasized. Smart electricity grid projects must contribute to security of supply, market integration, network security, and smart sector integration. Carbon dioxide transport and storage projects should focus on sustainability and avoiding emissions.

The proposal outlines several priority corridors and thematic areas for development, including offshore electricity grid developments. It also emphasizes"
