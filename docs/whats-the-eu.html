        <p>
          The European Union (EU) is a unique political and economic partnership
          made up of 27 European countries. With more than 450 million citizens,
          it combines features of both a federation and a confederation,
          allowing its member states to cooperate closely while remaining
          sovereign nations.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <h2><strong>System of Shared Sovereignty</strong></h2>
          <br />
          <br />
          Everything the EU does is based on treaties that are voluntarily
          signed and ratified by all member states. The two main legal
          foundations of the EU are the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and the
          Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Through these
          treaties, countries agree to transfer certain powers to the EU so that
          decisions can be taken collectively when this is considered more
          effective.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <h2><strong>The EU Institutions and How They Work Together</strong></h2>
          <br />
          <br />
          EU laws are mainly shaped by three institutions:
          <strong
            >European Commission, the European Parliament, and the Council of
            the European Union</strong
          >. The European Commission proposes new laws and ensures that EU rules
          are properly applied. The European Parliament, which represents EU
          citizens, and the Council of the European Union, which represents
          national governments, jointly examine, amend, and vote on these
          proposals. This process is known as the
          <strong>ordinary legislative procedure</strong>. For a law to be
          adopted, both the Parliament and the Council must agree on the final
          text. In the Council, most votes are taken using qualified majority
          voting, which means that decisions require the support of a majority
          of member states representing a majority of the EU population.
          <br />
          <br />
          The people who take decisions at the EU level are either directly or
          indirectly elected. Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) are
          directly elected by EU citizens every five years in European
          elections. National governments, which form the Council of the
          European Union, are elected at the national level by their own
          citizens. The President of the European Commission is proposed by the
          European Council—composed of elected national leaders—and must be
          approved by the European Parliament. This system ensures that EU
          decision-making is linked, in different ways, to democratic elections
          across the member states
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <h2><strong>How European Parliament Elections Work</strong></h2>
          <br />
          <br />
          European Parliament elections take place
          <strong>once every five years</strong> and allow EU citizens to choose
          their representatives at the European level. The most recent elections
          were held from 6–9 June 2024, and the next will be in 2029. <br /> <br>
          All eligible EU citizens have the right to vote directly for Members of
          the European Parliament (MEPs) in these elections. Every voter has a
          single vote and an equal say in choosing who represents them in the
          Parliament. To ensure that the Parliament reflects voters’ political
          preferences fairly, the elections use a proportional representation
          system in every EU member state. This means that the number of seats a
          political party wins is roughly proportional to the share of votes it
          receives in that country. For example, if a party gets 30% of the vote
          in a country that elects 10 MEPs, they’ll get about 3 seats.
          <br />
          <br />
          Under these rules, every vote counts the same within each member state
          in terms of contributing to how many seats a party wins. Because
          countries vary in size, the number of seats per country is determined
          by population (with a minimum of 6 and a maximum of 96 seats per
          state), but within each state the proportional system ensures equal
          treatment of each vote for seat allocation.
          <br />
          <br />
          Once votes are counted, seats are distributed to parties according to
          their share of votes. In countries with a threshold (such as 5% in
          some places like France), parties must pass that minimum share to get
          seats; other countries may have different rules but always
          proportionally.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <h2><strong>How Decisions Are Made</strong></h2>
          <br />
          <br />
          EU decision-making is guided by the two key principles. The
          <strong>principle of conferral</strong> means that the EU can only act
          in areas where the member states have explicitly given it authority.
          On the other hand, <strong>subsidiarity</strong> means that the EU
          should only take action when objectives cannot be sufficiently
          achieved by individual countries and would be better handled at the
          European level.
          <br /> <br>
          The EU has exclusive competence in certain areas, such as monetary
          policy for countries using the euro and common trade policy. In many
          other fields—such as policing, justice, education, and labor
          law—member states keep primary responsibility.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <h2><strong>How EU Laws Take Effect</strong></h2>
          <br />
          <br />
          Once a decision is adopted, the EU can use different legal
          instruments, notably regulations and directives. Regulations are
          directly applicable and become law in all member states immediately.
          Directives set binding objectives, but each country is free to decide
          how to achieve them through its national legislation.
