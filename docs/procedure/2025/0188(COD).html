      <h1>Commission's Proposal Summary</h1>
      <p>The European Commission has proposed a directive aimed at extending the period during which zero-emission heavy-duty vehicles, such as trucks and buses, can benefit from reduced road charges or exemptions. This initiative is part of the EU&#39;s broader strategy to promote cleaner technologies and reduce reliance on fossil fuels, with the ultimate goal of achieving climate neutrality. The heavy-duty road transport sector, a significant contributor to CO2 emissions, faces challenges in reducing emissions due to its competitive market and low profit margins, which limit investment in zero-emission vehicles.

To address the high upfront costs associated with zero-emission vehicles, the proposal offers reduced infrastructure or user charges, thereby lowering the total cost of ownership and making these vehicles more attractive to operators. This approach is intended to accelerate the adoption of zero-emission vehicles, which is crucial for meeting future CO2 reduction targets. The directive builds on existing legislation that allows for differentiated road charges based on CO2 emissions, further incentivizing the shift towards cleaner vehicles by reducing operational costs.

Member States are permitted to apply higher external-cost charges for traffic-based CO2 emissions, potentially providing up to EUR 45,000 in monetary support in the first year of operation for zero-emission vehicles weighing up to 40 tonnes. This support varies for smaller vehicles and aims to achieve cost parity between zero-emission and conventional vehicles in some cases.</p>

      <h1>Final Act Summary</h1>
      <p>The European Parliament and the Council have adopted a directive to extend the period during which zero-emission heavy-duty vehicles can benefit from reduced road charges or exemptions in the EU. This move aims to encourage the adoption of zero-emission vehicles by addressing the high upfront costs and operational expenses that currently hinder their widespread use. The directive amends existing legislation to allow member states to offer these financial incentives until June 30, 2031, instead of the previous deadline of December 31, 2025. This extension is intended to better align with the CO2 emissions reduction targets set for the transport sector, providing a more favorable business case for investing in zero-emission vehicles. While member states are not obligated to implement these changes, they are required to inform the Commission if they choose to continue offering these incentives beyond the original deadline. This directive is part of broader efforts to promote sustainable and smart mobility within the EU.</p>
