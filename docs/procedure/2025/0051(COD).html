      <h1>Commission's Proposal Summary</h1>
      <p>The European Commission has proposed a regulation to amend existing legislation concerning the role of gas storage in securing gas supplies ahead of the winter season. This proposal, submitted to the European Parliament, aims to extend measures initially introduced to address the 2022 energy crisis, which underscored the EU&#39;s reliance on non-EU energy sources. The proposal seeks to bolster the EU&#39;s energy security by enhancing underground gas storage capacity, upgrading liquefied natural gas infrastructure, and diversifying gas sources and routes.

A central element of the proposal is the extension of the November gas storage filling target, which mandates that gas storage facilities be 90% full by November 1st. This target, along with intermediate targets set for February, May, July, and September, is designed to ensure a stable gas supply during the winter months. The proposal also introduces flexibility for Member States to adjust their filling trajectories based on market conditions, allowing them to respond swiftly to changes and capitalize on favorable purchasing opportunities.

The proposal underscores the importance of gas storage in maintaining supply security, as it provides additional supply during periods of high demand or disruptions. Amendments introduced in 2022, including certification requirements for storage system operators, have helped prevent price spikes and ensure sufficient gas reserves. The Commission will continue to monitor storage levels and coordinate with Member States to mitigate risks and ensure compliance with the November target. The proposal also includes a commitment to review the security of supply framework post-2027 to assess the long-term value of permanent storage measures.</p>

      <h1>Final Act Summary</h1>
      <p>The European Parliament and the Council have adopted a regulation aimed at enhancing Europe&#39;s gas supply security, particularly before the winter season, by strengthening the role of gas storage facilities. This regulation requires gas storage facilities to reach 90% capacity by November 1st each year, with specific targets set throughout the year. Developed in response to the energy crisis and geopolitical tensions, such as Russia&#39;s war against Ukraine, the regulation seeks to reduce Europe&#39;s reliance on Russian gas. Member States must submit annual filling plans by September 15th, detailing targets for February, May, July, and September, based on the average filling rate over the past five years. In challenging market conditions, deviations from the filling target are permitted, with additional allowances if conditions persist. The regulation emphasizes monitoring market conditions and using mechanisms like demand aggregation and joint purchasing to meet targets, extending these provisions until the end of 2027. Member States without underground gas storage facilities must ensure market participants have arrangements to use storage volumes corresponding to at least 15% of their average annual gas consumption. The Commission will assess the impact of any deviations and inform the Gas Coordination Group. The regulation also includes provisions for shared responsibility between the Slovak Republic and Czechia for the Dolní Bojanovice storage facility, with details subject to a bilateral agreement. The regulation is binding and directly applicable in all Member States, entering into force the day after its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.</p>
