      <h1>Commission's Proposal Summary</h1>
      <p>The European Commission has proposed a legislative change aimed at providing additional assistance and flexibility to the outermost regions of the European Union, particularly in response to severe natural disasters like Cyclone Chido, which devastated Mayotte in 2024. This proposal seeks to amend existing regulations to better support these regions, which face unique challenges due to their remoteness, insularity, and economic dependence on limited sectors. These challenges are often exacerbated by frequent natural disasters that severely impact agriculture and infrastructure, making recovery difficult and prolonged.

To address these issues, the proposal enhances the Programme for the Organization of Support for the Economies of the Outermost Regions (POSEI), which provides financial support to these areas. Key changes include removing the cap on funds allocated for liquidity support to farmers and other agricultural stakeholders affected by natural disasters, allowing regions like Mayotte to reallocate more resources for recovery efforts. Additionally, the proposal extends the deadline for approving applications for this support, recognizing the need for a swift response to natural disasters and the time required for managing authorities to select beneficiaries.

The proposal also introduces a derogation to the capping of measures for Mayotte, allowing the region to address the liquidity needs of its rural population more effectively. This derogation is limited to the specific needs of Mayotte and is intended to provide targeted assistance without altering the overall legal framework of the Common Agricultural Policy and the European Structural and Investment Funds.</p>

      <h1>Final Act Summary</h1>
      <p>The European Parliament and the Council have adopted a regulation to provide additional support and flexibility to the outermost regions of the European Union, particularly in response to the devastating impact of Cyclone Chido on Mayotte. This regulation aims to address the severe consequences of natural disasters in these vulnerable regions, which are significantly affected by climate change. It allows for continued financial support through the Programme of Options Specifically Relating to Remoteness and Insularity (POSEI) during the recovery period, even if local agricultural and forestry activities are disrupted. Additionally, the regulation introduces measures to offer rapid and exceptional support through the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) to help rebuild Mayotte&#39;s food system and support its rural communities. These measures are designed to be implemented at the Union level, as they are deemed more effective than individual national efforts, while ensuring that the actions taken are proportionate to the needs of the affected regions. In light of the urgent need to address the impact of such disasters, the regulation invokes an exception to expedite its implementation, allowing for amendments to existing programs to ensure continued support during the restoration period. This regulation will enter into force immediately upon publication, ensuring swift action to mitigate the effects of the disaster on Mayotte&#39;s agricultural and rural sectors.</p>
