      <h1>Commission's Proposal Summary</h1>
      <p>The European Commission has proposed a regulation aimed at shortening the securities settlement cycle in the EU from two business days (T+2) to one business day (T+1). This initiative seeks to enhance the efficiency and competitiveness of EU capital markets, which are vital for supporting the EU&#39;s digital, green, and social transitions. Despite efforts to integrate these markets, they remain fragmented, which hinders their development. Reports from 2024 highlight the need for innovation in post-trade services, which are crucial for the issuance, settlement, and risk management of securities.

Currently, over EUR 4 trillion in securities are settled daily in EU central securities depositories (CSDs). Longer settlement periods increase risks for buyers and sellers, delay investors&#39; access to funds or securities, and limit opportunities for further transactions. The proposal aligns with a global trend towards shorter settlement cycles, with countries like the US, China, India, and Canada already adopting T+1. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) recommends moving to T+1 by October 2027, citing benefits such as risk reduction, margin savings, and alignment with global markets.

Shortening the settlement cycle would require significant changes in market operations, impacting various stakeholders differently. While the transition may incur short-term costs related to modernizing and digitalizing settlement processes, the long-term benefits include improved market integration and avoiding competitive disadvantages for EU markets. Maintaining the current T+2 cycle could further fragment the market.</p>

      <h1>Final Act Summary</h1>
      <p>The European Parliament and the Council have adopted a regulation to shorten the settlement cycle for securities transactions in the EU from T+2 to T+1, meaning transactions must be settled by the next business day. This move aims to reduce risks and align with global market trends, enhancing the competitiveness of EU capital markets. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) supports this change, though certain securities financing transactions, like securities lending and repurchase transactions, are exempt to prevent discouraging their execution on trading venues. The regulation includes measures to address settlement fails and allows the European Commission to adjust regulations if necessary to mitigate adverse impacts, ensuring any changes are temporary and proportionate. ESMA is tasked with monitoring settlement efficiency, particularly for exempted transactions, and will report frequently during the transition period. The regulation emphasizes coordination and preparation among stakeholders, deferring its application date to ensure a smooth transition. Additionally, the regulation requires detailed reporting on the categories of transactions, their intended settlement dates, and whether they are executed on trading venues. It also mandates an assessment of the market impact and justification for exemptions from the T+1 settlement requirement for certain securities financing transactions. The regulation will enter into force on the twentieth day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union and will apply from 11 October 2027.</p>
