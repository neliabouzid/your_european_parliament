      <h1>Commission's Proposal Summary</h1>
      <p>The European Commission has proposed an amendment to existing legislation concerning the obligations of economic operators in the battery industry, focusing on enhancing due diligence policies. This proposal addresses challenges such as the complexities of sourcing raw materials and the need for third-party verification of due diligence policies. Initially, companies placing batteries on the market were required to adhere to specific environmental and health standards, verified by accredited bodies. However, many member states have not yet appointed the necessary authorities to oversee this process, and there is no established standard for accrediting these bodies.

To address these issues, the Commission suggests postponing the application date of these obligations by two years. This delay is intended to give companies more time to prepare and to resolve the current difficulties with the availability of accredited bodies. The proposal aligns with the European Green Deal&#39;s objectives and seeks to provide additional time for compliance without altering the substantive rules of the original regulation. It also considers the recent Directive on corporate sustainability due diligence, ensuring that the more specific requirements of the battery regulation take precedence where applicable. This approach aims to harmonize the obligations under both the battery regulation and the broader corporate sustainability directive.

The proposal also addresses consistency by harmonizing the publication dates for guidelines under both pieces of legislation, allowing them to be developed concurrently. The legal basis for this initiative is to prevent divergences that could hamper the free circulation of batteries within the EU. The Commission is tasked with publishing guidelines on the application of due diligence requirements and making available guidance and best practices.</p>

      <h1>Final Act Summary</h1>
      <p>The European Parliament and the Council have adopted a regulation amending existing legislation concerning the due diligence obligations of economic operators in the battery supply chain. This amendment extends the deadline for compliance with these obligations from August 18, 2025, to August 18, 2027, providing additional time for battery manufacturers to adjust their supply chains amid challenges in sourcing raw materials like cobalt, natural graphite, lithium, and nickel. The regulation also addresses the need for third-party verification by notified bodies, whose designation has been delayed, and emphasizes the importance of aligning guidelines with related human rights and environmental directives. The aim is to ensure that companies can effectively manage adverse impacts on human health and the environment while maintaining a smooth functioning of the internal market. This regulation is set to enter into force immediately upon publication in the Official Journal of the European Union, reflecting the urgency of the matter and the need for legal certainty.</p>
