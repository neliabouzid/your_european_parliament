          <h2>The Ordinary Legislative Procedure</h2>
          <br>
The Ordinary Legislative Procedure is the main way the European Union makes its laws. It is used for most EU policies and is designed to ensure that laws are approved both by representatives of EU citizens and by the governments of the member states. This reflects the EU’s dual nature as a union of people and of countries.
<br><br>

<h2>The Institutional Triangle</h2>
<br>
At the heart of this process are three institutions that work together. The European Commission starts the process by proposing a new law. It has this role to ensure that proposals serve the general interest of the EU rather than the interests of a single country. Before making a proposal, the Commission usually carries out studies, consults experts, stakeholders, and the public, and checks whether action at EU level is really necessary. National parliaments can also intervene at this early stage if they believe the issue should be handled nationally rather than by the EU.
<br><br>

Once the Commission presents a proposal, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union become co-legislators. The Parliament represents EU citizens, while the Council represents the governments of the member states. Neither institution can pass a law alone; both must agree on the same final text.
<br><br>

In the Parliament, proposals are first examined in specialized committees. An elected Member of the European Parliament is appointed to lead the work, suggest changes, and negotiate with the other institutions. The full Parliament then votes on the proposal and any amendments. The Parliament can approve it, change it, or reject it entirely.
<br><br>

At the same time, the Council examines the proposal through national experts, ambassadors, and finally ministers from each country. Most decisions in the Council are taken by a system called qualified majority voting, which requires support from a majority of countries representing a majority of the EU population. This system is meant to balance the influence of large and small states.
<br><br>

<h2>The Three Readings and Conciliation</h2>
<br>
The law-making process usually happens in stages called “readings.” In the first reading, the Parliament and the Council try to reach agreement as early as possible. If they agree on the same text, the law is adopted. If they disagree, the proposal moves to a second reading, where deadlines are stricter and voting rules are tougher. If disagreements still remain, a final negotiation stage called conciliation brings equal numbers of Parliament and Council representatives together to find a compromise. If they fail, the proposal is abandoned.
<br><br>

In practice, many agreements are reached informally through meetings known as trilogues, where representatives of the Parliament, the Council, and the Commission negotiate behind the scenes. These meetings make the process faster and more efficient, but they are often criticized for reducing transparency and public debate.
<br><br>

<h2>Post-Adoption and Implementation</h2>
<br>
After a law is adopted, the work may not be finished. The Parliament and the Council sometimes give the Commission the power to adopt additional technical rules to implement or update the law, while still keeping the right to supervise or block these decisions.
<br><br>

Overall, the Ordinary Legislative Procedure is complex but central to how the EU functions. It forces compromise between institutions, balances democratic representation with national interests, and turns political ideas into binding law. While it has become more efficient over time, especially through informal negotiations, it continues to face challenges in maintaining transparency and democratic accountability.
